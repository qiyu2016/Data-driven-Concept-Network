Fault location on high voltage transmission line by applying support vector regression with fault signal amplitudes
 This paper proposes a novel high voltage transmission line fault location scheme based on application of support vector regression (SVR). The proposed scheme just uses the amplitudes of the fault voltage waveforms, measured at a single end of the line. Various types of faults at different locations with different fault impedances and a variety of fault inception angles are studied on a 400 kV–300 km high-voltage transmission line power system. The fault voltages are obtained from 1/8 cycle post-fault signals after the noise has been eliminated using a low-pass filter. The amplitudes of the fault voltage signals are used as features to train the SVR. After training, the SVR is used in the exact location of the fault on the transmission line. When compared with other fault location schemes, the proposed scheme requires less information and a smaller time data window to estimate the fault locations. However, the proposed scheme provides more accurate estimations, irrespective of the fault types, fault inception angles and fault impedances.
Transmission line fault location using traveling wave frequencies and extreme learning machine
 In this research, a new approach was proposed for determining the fault location in transmission lines. Traveling wave frequencies and an extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to determine fault location. Transient signals in the time domain were transformed to the frequency domain using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the traveling wave frequencies were detected from the transient frequency spectrum. In order to detect the location of fault, traveling wave frequency was used initially to predict the fault location. The prediction of this fault location was tested for many different fault conditions and was found to be adversely affected by only the source inductance value. This is due to the negative effect of source inductance on wave velocity. Regression feature of ELM was used in order to improve the prediction of fault location and to minimize the negative effect of source inductance. For ELM regression training, values of the fault distance estimated from the traveling-wave frequencies and the source inductance values were used as ELM input data, and the actual distance values were used as ELM output data. After ELM regression training, ELM predicted a new fault location using the input data. The Alternative Transients Program (ATP/EMTP) was used to model J. Marti frequency dependent line model, and the MATLAB program was used to perform fault-detection algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed method is very successful against many variables such as different fault resistances, source inductances, transmission line characteristics, transmission line lengths.
New fault location scheme for four-circuit untransposed transmission lines
 This paper introduces a new fault location scheme for two-terminal four-circuit untransposed transmission line using synchronized measurements. The current phasors at both line terminals and the voltage phasor at only one terminal are needed to formulate the fault location equation. The proposed scheme is developed based on theory of transmission lines and expansion of Taylor series for the distributed line model parameters. The mutual coupling between all phases and the untransposition of the line are considered to obtain precise results. The faulty phases are determined using Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and all fault types including normal shunt and inter-circuit faults can be located. DIgSILENT Power Factory software is used to simulate the power system and the fault location calculations are carried out using MATLAB. The proposed scheme is investigated under different fault locations, fault inception angles, fault types, and fault resistances. The influence of soil resistivity variation, measurement and synchrophasors errors, errors in line parameters, various line lengths, non-linear time-varying arc resistance, and complex fault impedance is also investigated. The simulation results confirm the validity of the fault location scheme for all test cases.
Gabor transform-based fault location method for multi-terminal transmission lines
 Fault location in multi-terminal transmission lines is faced with different challenges such as high computation burden imposed by signal processing tools and different transmission line topologies. In this paper, a new method based on the Gabor transform (GT) for fault section determination and fault location calculation in multi-terminal lines is presented. The paper describes some benefits of the GT for analyzing modal components of synchronized current (or voltage) signals at all terminals. Then, to determine fault section and fault location, the arrival times of the first peak waves generated by the fault is utilized. One of the features of the GT is that it does not need to choose any tuning parameters. Moreover, it has robust performance under noisy conditions. The GT exerts low computation burden and it is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), making it suitable for practical implementation. In this paper, the proposed method is also compared with a number of different fault location algorithms. The obtained numerical results under various fault conditions confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. The results also show that the proposed fault locator is independent of the power system configuration.
Transmission line fault detection and location using Wide Area Measurements
 Knowledge of both voltage and current data is conventionally entailed for locating fault on transmission network. However, owing to the non-linearity of the system, the process becomes iterative and cumbersome. In order to address this issue, a new technique for fault location on transmission lines using only voltage measurements obtained from Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) and the network bus admittance matrix has been reported in this paper. It is based on the fundamental law of electrical networks. It delineates a single step method to find out the faulted line and the exact location of fault. The decision is based on change in injected current at various buses following the line fault. The method has been tested on IEEE 14 bus and New England 39 bus system. Applicability of the proposed algorithm is independent of fault type, location of fault and fault resistance. This method not only proves to be accurate but also furnishes quick results with reduced computational burden. Besides, the faulted phase as well as fault type detection has been suggested in this paper using same measurements.
Unsynchronized fault-location technique for two- and three-terminal transmission lines
 In this work, a novel fault-locator technique for two- and three-terminal power transmission lines is introduced. Unsynchronized three-phase current and voltage measurements of all line ends are processed for estimating the required synchronization angle/s and the fault location via exploiting the initial conditions of each fault type. To realize this target, the computations of the required synchronization angle/s are initially accomplished independent of the fault location via considering a lumped charging current at the reference terminal which is selected arbitrarily. Consequently, the initial fault location is determined via equating the deduced equations of the positive-sequence voltage at the faulty point from two sides of the faulted segment as a function of the measured data after their correction. The previous obtained fault location is, then, utilized as an input for the next iterative computations, where the distributed line model is used to update the charging current. This process is repeated until the change rate of the obtained fault location becomes negligible. The proposed technique has been examined and assessed under different fault scenarios simulated using MATLAB. The sample results of the assessment are declared and discussed.
Accurate arcing fault location method for M-terminal transmission lines
 Arcing faults (AFs) are highly complex nonlinear phenomena which in turn cause voltages and currents of M-terminal transmission lines vary nonlinearly with time. So, the conventional fault location algorithms which use fundamental frequency of the signals, cannot locate the AFs, precisely. This paper proposes an accurate method to locate the AFs occurring on M-terminal transmission lines. The algorithm consists of two subroutines. In subroutine 1, the faulty section is determined; and in subroutine 2, the exact location of AF is calculated. The proposed method uses synchronized voltage and current measurements at all terminals and does not employ source impedances of the external networks. In addition, the proposed method takes advantage of distributed parameter line model in the time domain which accurately models the line. Since just one minimization problem is used for all AF types, classification of AF type and selection of faulty phase are not needed. An extensive series of simulations has been performed. The results, considering various AF conditions, show the high accuracy and efficiency of the offered method.
New fault location scheme for three-terminal untransposed parallel transmission lines
 This paper proposes a new fault location scheme in the phase-domain for three-terminal untransposed double-circuit transmission lines utilizing synchronized voltage and current measurements obtained by GPS technique. The proposed scheme is derived taking into consideration the distributed line model and the mutual couplings effect between the parallel lines to obtain accurate results. The proposed scheme is derived based on the transmission line theory and Taylor series expansion of the distributed line model parameters. All fault types including normal shunt faults, evolving faults, and cross-country faults can be discriminated from each other and the fault location can be obtained for all fault types. The evolving faults include earth faults occurring at the same location in two phases of one circuit or two phases of different circuits at different fault inception time. While cross-country faults include earth faults occurring at different locations in two phases of one circuit or two phases of different circuits at same or different fault inception time. The proposed scheme is tested under different fault locations, different fault resistances, different fault inception angles, and all fault types including cross-country and evolving faults. Also, the effect of different sampling rate, measurement and synchronization errors, earth resistivity variations, and transmission line parameters errors on the proposed scheme is considered. Simulations studies conducted by MATLAB software demonstrate that the maximum estimation error in fault location does not exceed 3.06%.
Fault test analysis in transmission lines throughout interfering synchrophasor signals
 The distribution of power supplies be obliged to offer reliable, superior-quality in power. To obtain good power quality the transmission line faults identification should be more precise, consistence and complete rectification is required. The faults in the transmission and distribution lines influence the power quality. The major faults in transmission lines such as line to ground fault, line-to-line fault and three-phase faults. This paper proposes a unique organized interrelated structure for fault-location and classification technique for transmission lines through an experimental set-up similar to transmission and distribution for good power quality. The proposed method utilizes synchrophasor measurements during the disturbances from the transmission lines and compares with ideal condition signals for fault location and classification. From the results, the synchrophasor measurements identify faults in the initial stage. The phasor measurement results are modelled through regression modelling for precise measurement. Various faults are modelled for the earlier detection in the transmission lines.
Transmission line fault location using hybrid wavelet-Prony method and relief algorithm
 Context: Intelligent fault locating in transmission lines consists of three main steps: feature extraction, feature selection, and utilizing a learning tool. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to propose a systematic approach for intelligent fault locating in transmission lines. Method: This paper extracts a group of candidate features by applying a combination of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and Improved Prony Analysis (IPA) methods on single-ended voltage measurements. To have an accurate fault location estimate, useful and efficient features are selected among the candidate features using the regression relief algorithm. In this paper, performances of three regression learning tools including the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and the Random Forests (RF) in the fault location problem are evaluated and compared, and the best tool is introduced. Results: Numerous training and test patterns are generated through simulation of various fault types in an untransposed transmission line based on different values of fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle, and magnitude and direction of load current. The results of evaluation using theses patterns show the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. For various fault types in the test cases, the average values of fault location estimation errors are in the range of 0.153–0.202%. Conclusion: Besides accuracy, the proposed fault locating method is immune against current signal measurement errors and it does not face the problems and costs related to the transmitting and synchronizing data of both line ends.
Fast accurate fault location on transmission system utilizing wide-area unsynchronized measurements
 This article presents a closed-form solution for transmission line fault location without the need for GPS-synchronized sampling of wide-area measurements. Unsynchronized measurements recorded by sparse intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) across the grid are gathered and bus impedance matrix is utilized to relate the measurements to fault location by nonlinear complex functions. A linear reformulation of the problem allows for integrating unsynchronized voltage and current measurements, together with two auxiliary variables, into a linear least-squares problem. Schur-Banachiewicz inversion formula is next utilized to obtain a closed-form solution for fault location. The distributed parameter model of the line is considered and the method identifies the faulted line and locates the fault along it regardless of fault type and resistance. Furthermore, in contrast to previous methods, the proposed method on the one hand obviates the need for GPS-synchronized sampling, and on the other hand avoids iterative procedures. Extensive time-domain simulations for the WSCC 9-bus and a 22-bus subnetwork of the IEEE 118-bus test systems confirm the effectiveness of the method for different faults across the grid.
Design of a one-sided, impedance-based transmission line fault locator using line topology and source impedances
 The article discusses an algorithm for a one-sided, impedance-based (transmission) line fault locator using line topology. Standard one-sided impedance-based fault locators, included in the digital protection systems [2], [3], [4], [8] compute the distance to the fault using the symmetrical components of line impedance. Section 5 demonstrates that this method of determining the distance to the fault exhibits significant inaccuracies in the case of a non-transposed line. The designed algorithm eliminates this inaccuracy, as it computes the distance to the fault with regard to impedance of corresponding phase, or more precisely the faulty loop. Moreover, the algorithm reflects the source impedances on both sides of the line and therefore eliminates or decreases the influence of power from the opposite side to determine the distance to the fault.
Analysis of half-wavelength transmission line under critical balanced faults: Voltage response and overvoltage mitigation procedure
 This paper presents a detailed study of half-wavelength (HWL) transmission line system under critical fault conditions. This non-conventional ultra high voltage alternating current (UHVAC) transmission line has excellent properties in steady-state operation condition and economic advantage when compared to conventional UHVAC system and even high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems for similar power capacity. This technology has been studied for many decades and its response under condition fault is an important topic. First, the point of fault and the type of fault conditions are evaluated to confirm that balanced faults in specific regions are critical. Then the main characteristics of voltage response of HWL transmission system under balanced fault are presented and critical regions that produce severe overvoltage are identified and main transient characteristics are described. Finally, a preliminary mitigation procedure is shown and its performance is evaluated.
A double ended AC series arc fault location algorithm for a low-voltage indoor power line using impedance parameters and a neural network
 This paper presents a novel method for the distance estimation of a series arc fault in a low-voltage indoor power line. This method is based on the SIMULINK modeling of an electrical line by using its RLCG parameters. Rather than using an arc fault model, arc faults are inserted at different points across the line, using measured data. Faults using carbonized paths and opening contacts between two copper electrodes are considered. The algorithm estimates the arc fault distances by employing both the voltages and currents at two ends of the line, calculating their DFFT (Discrete Fast Fourier Transform) and then inserting these magnitudes, into Kirchhoff equations which take into account impedance parameters of the simplified approach line model. The arc fault is generated at an unknown distance. As the impedance parameters depend on the fault location, sets of supposed fault distances (varying by one-meter steps) are inserted in these equations. Thus, the extraction of currents peak values at the fundamental frequency (50 Hz) generates a signature vector. A neural network is trained using signature vectors as inputs (for faults generated at different distances). Finally, the algorithm thus developed is validated in two steps. First, the fault distances are estimated using distances not considered in the training process. Secondly, the fault distances are estimated using other series arc faults data not considered in the learning process. The results obtained in this work show that fault location can be successfully estimated both for faults generated by opening contacts and for carbonized paths. Additionally, the algorithm has successfully tested on different line lengths and considering also changes on the impedance parameters of the line.

The proposed algorithm uses voltages and currents measurements provided by intelligent electronic devices installed at both line ends to calculate the voltages at the fault point and to determine the exact fault location. The paper also presents a detailed mathematical model of the series compensation, which is capable of representing its behavior accurately, improving the algorithm's response. The authors implemented a series-compensated double-circuit transmission line using the Alternative Transients Program, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that it presents a high level of accuracy.
A Novel Fault Detection and Fault Location Method for VSC-HVDC Links Based on Gap Frequency Spectrum Analysis
 This paper proposes a one-end gap-based fault location method for VSC-HVDC transmission line using the fault current signal. Using the post-fault current time series, the frequency spectrum is generated for measuring the gaps between the contiguous peak frequencies. This method is able to locate the fault by analyzing the single-end fault current, which guarantees a faster response than using two-end data. The new gap-based approach is able to give accurate fault detection using any appropriate range of post-fault signal. Furthermore, the proposed method is fault resistance independent. A two-terminal VSC-HVDC system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC. The algorithm is verified by studying different cases of different fault resistances in various fault locations. The result shows that the proposed method gives an accurate and reliable fault location detection along DC transmission line. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be potentially used in other HVDC systems.
Support vector machine based fault classification and location of a long transmission line
 This paper investigates support vector machine based fault type and distance estimation scheme in a long transmission line. The planned technique uses post fault single cycle current waveform and pre-processing of the samples is done by wavelet packet transform. Energy and entropy are obtained from the decomposed coefficients and feature matrix is prepared. Then the redundant features from the matrix are taken out by the forward feature selection method and normalized. Test and train data are developed by taking into consideration variables of a simulation situation like fault type, resistance path, inception angle, and distance. In this paper 10 different types of short circuit fault are analyzed. The test data are examined by support vector machine whose parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization method. The anticipated method is checked on a 400 kV, 300 km long transmission line with voltage source at both the ends. Two cases were examined with the proposed method. The first one is fault very near to both the source end (front and rear) and the second one is support vector machine with and without optimized parameter. Simulation result indicates that the anticipated method for fault classification gives high accuracy (99.21%) and least fault distance estimation error (<0.21%) for all discussed cases. In order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, a comparison is carried out with methods published by other researchers. Separate investigation is also carried out with the transmission line placing thyristor controlled series capacitor in the middle and applying the same proposed method. It is observed from the test results of the thyristor controlled series capacitor based transmission line model that fault classification gives a high accuracy of 98.36% and absolute fault location error is >0.29%.
ICA feature extraction for the location and classification of faults in high-voltage transmission lines
 Several methods for the location and classification of faults in power transmission lines using computational intelligence and digital signal processing techniques have been described in literature. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and wavelet transform (WT) have drawn significant attention lately, but they present some drawbacks when dealing with power systems faults where data are often contaminated by noise. This paper proposes an approach by combining independent component analysis (ICA) with travelling wave (TW) theory and support vector machine (SVM). The approach is adequate to locate and recognize faults in high-voltage (HV) transmission lines, while the acquired signals are noisy. Experiments performed for distinct types and locations of faults in a real transmission line model have shown that the proposed combined methods are able to provide excellent performance in fault location. The obtained errors are lower than 1% and accuracy is 100% for the classification of fault signals with noise. It can be stated that this method presents better performance than those regarding the main conventional techniques such as wavelets and neural networks in the presence of noise.
A single-ended fault location method for segmented HVDC transmission line
 This paper presents a single-ended traveling wave-based fault location method for segmented high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines; an overhead line combined with an underground cable. DC transient voltage and current signals at the sending-end of the overhead line are assumed to be available. Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) is then applied to the DC voltage and current signals. The wavelet energies of voltage and current transients over 16 ms (i.e. 1-cyle in 60-Hz frequency) are calculated and then normalized. The normalized energies are used as the input to a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for faulty section identification (underground cable or overhead line). Once the faulty section is identified, the faulty-half is determined by comparing polarity of the first two current traveling waves. Bewley diagrams are finally observed for the traveling wave pattern and the wavelet coefficients squared of DC voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient voltage and current for different fault locations are simulated using the ATP software. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for different fault locations and fault resistances. The impacts of non-linear high impedance faults (NLHIF) and cable aging are also studied.
A new fault detection and fault location method for multi-terminal high voltage direct current of offshore wind farm
 This paper proposes a novel protection scheme for multi-terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MTDC) systems incorporating offshore wind farm based on high-frequency components detected from the fault current signal. This method can accurately detect the fault on each line and classify the fault types. Using the post-fault current time series, both single-ended measurements (detection and classification) and double-end measurements (location), the frequency spectrum is generated to measure the gaps between the contiguous peak frequencies giving a robust and comprehensive scheme. Unlike the previous travelling wave based methods, which must identify the travelling wavefront and require a high sampling rate, the new gap-based approach is able to give accurate fault detection and fault location using any appropriate range of post-fault signals. Furthermore, the proposed method is fault resistance independent and thus even a very high fault impedance has no effect on the fault location detection. By immediately tripping the faults, the fault-caused disturbance to the offshore wind farm is minimized. A three-terminal voltage sourced converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system connection of offshore wind farm is modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC (Power Systems Computer Aided Design/Electro-Magnetic Transients including DC) software, which is used for obtaining the fault current data for the transmission line terminal. The algorithm is verified by studying a range of cases, by varying the fault resistance fault locations and also including external faults. The results show that the proposed method gives an accurate and reliable fault detection, classification and location on the test MTDC system.
A novel single-ended fault location scheme for parallel transmission lines using k-nearest neighbor algorithm
 This paper proposes k-nearest neighbour (k-NN)-based method for fault location estimation of all types of fault in parallel lines using one-terminal measurement. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used for pre-processing the signals and then the standard deviation of one cycle of pre-fault and one cycle of post-fault samples are used as inputs to k-NN algorithm. The results obtained under various fault conditions demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed scheme to estimate the fault location. The accuracy of the k-NN-based fault location scheme is not affected by alteration in fault type including inter-circuit faults, fault location, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and pre-fault load angle.
Fault location in power distribution network with presence of distributed generation resources using impedance based method and applying π line model
 The power distribution networks (PDN) are spread in different street and Alley. Furthermore, nowadays, the DG is used in PDN, especially photovoltaic (PV). Therefore, fault location in these PDNs is complex. In this paper, an improved impedance based method has been proposed for fault location in power distribution network with presence of photovoltaic distributed generation resources. According that the PV has an uncertain behavior in different conditions, the proposed method is designed to be robust against PV behavior and upstream feeder changes. In the suggested method, detail equations are derived to prove a new quadratic equation for locating fault in PDNs using recorded voltage and current at the beginning of feeder and DG terminals. According to this proved equation is depended on to just voltage and currents of source or substation terminals, consequently dynamic modeling of PV and substation is not important in the proposed method. Within this method, the π line model is used for improving the accuracy of the suggested method. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, the modified 11 node test Feeder is simulated in the MATLAB software and sensitivity of the suggested method was investigated against the different fault distances fault types, fault resistances and fault inception angles. Furthermore, the proposed method is investigated and tested on the real test feeder in power system simulator of power system and protection Lab. in Persian Gulf University. The results indicate the high accuracy of the algorithm.
Measurement of fault resistances in transmission lines by using recorded signals at both line ends
 This article shows the results obtained by using a method for the calculation of fault resistances in transmission lines, like these resistances are really seen at the location of protective relays. The method is based on a well-known algorithm for fault location, which is complemented here in order to compute the fault resistances. The original algorithm for fault location only uses information from one line end, and it is applied twice here (once from each line end) in order to obtain the information to compute the fault resistances. For each fault, a fault resistance is computed from each line end, and the reported value is the average of both values if they satisfy the selected criterion of coherence (otherwise, the measurement is considered as no valid). This method was applied for the measurement of fault resistances for 70 actual faults, recorded at different voltage levels (230 kV, 400 kV, and 765 kV). The statistical behavior of these measured values shows that the fault resistances are moderate in a high percentage of cases. The knowledge about the statistical behavior of fault resistances is important for the protection of transmission lines, and these results can be complemented in the future by analyzing more data, in order to improve this knowledge. Other methods, based in other fault location algorithms, could be also applied in order to obtain the measured values of fault resistances from recorded data of real faults. The application of a criterion of coherence, for comparing the computed values of fault resistance from each line end, is a novel idea and it is important to consider the possible imperfections in the measurements and/or in power system models.
Fault localization for transmission lines with optimal Phasor Measurement Units
 This paper discusses a novel fault localization algorithm for multi-terminal transmission lines. The technique is tested for different fault types and fault locations. The exact fault location is determined along with the latitude and longitude by involving geo-referenced data of the power system. In addition, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are effectively used for complete system observability. The number of PMUs is optimised using Genetic Algorithm. Thus, the objective is to find the distance of the fault occurrence and to locate the fault point along with the latitude and longitude, using optimal PMUs. For evaluation purpose, Indian Utility (TamilNadu Electricity Board) 49 bus system is used and validated, using software such as MATLAB, Power World Simulator and Google Earth View. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to spot the exact fault point in the transmission lines with a minimum number of PMUs, to make the concept economical.
Impedance-based fault location methods: Sensitivity analysis and performance improvement
 This paper deals with analysis and improvement of two-terminal impedance based fault location methods for transmission lines. Firstly, a customised sensitivity analysis (CSA) for this class of methods is discussed, which allows a more comprehensive analysis than those so far used for evaluating the robustness to uncertainties of the input parameters (such as phasors and electrical line parameters). Second, a customised modal transformation (CMT) is derived from CSA, aiming to improve impedance-based fault location methods for performance. Such an approach uses the Park transformation along with a cost function obtained from the CSA. To assess the effectiveness of the developed approach, four two-terminal fault location methods from the literature, using both distributed parameter line model and only fault data, are considered. Evaluation tests based on Alternative Transients Program (ATP) simulations have shown that the proposed approach presents results quantitatively superior than other approaches from the literature confirming its applicability.
Fault location scheme for multi-terminal transmission lines using unsynchronized measurements
 In this paper, a simple alternative fault location algorithm for multi-terminal transmission lines using unsynchronized measurements is proposed. The developed data synchronization procedure is employed to identify the faulted leg before the fault location is calculated. The fault location algorithm is independent of the fault resistance and source impedance variations. The proposed faulted leg identification and location algorithm is extensively tested for all major fault types and different high fault resistances. The results show that the proposed multi-terminal fault location algorithm is fast, accurate and immune to power system transients.
Two-terminal AF location scheme for multi-segment combined transmission lines using unsynchronized measurements
 Arcing faults (AFs) have probabilistic and nonlinear nature which is related to environmental parameters. Thus, the conventional fault location methods can not locate the AFs, accurately. This article puts forward a novel and precise AF location technique for multi-segment combined transmission lines which uses unsynchronized measurements from two terminals of the line. The method consists of stages; the number of them is equal to the number of segments plus one. This scheme does not need to employ a selector to identify the faulty segment of the line. Finally, the case studies are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink with variations of fault conditions including fault distance, type, incidence angle and faulty segment of the line, and also with variations of synchronization angle which show that the presented method provides a high accuracy in AF location under various situations.
Optimal placement of voltage measurements for wide area fault location observability considering the uncertainty of network parameters
 This paper proposes an optimization method based on genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the number and location of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in order to wide area fault location based on voltage measurement. In the practical condition, due to the uncertainty of network parameters including measurement errors and inaccuracy of line parameter values, the estimation of the fault location may be not accurate. Therefore, the proposed method has been developed to determine the number and location of PMUs in order to achieve an acceptable accuracy with required reliability. Since the number and location of PMU depends on the fault location method, a new fault location method has been developed with minimum required number of PMUs. The new method can determine the fault location by measuring from one side of the fault point instead of two sides. Therefore, the number of required PMUs is minimized at comparison to previously presented methods. The weighted least-square (WLS) method is used to solve the fault location problem by minimizing the measurement errors. To consider unsynchronized condition of measurements, the formulation has been modified using only the magnitudes of voltage measurements. Finally, the method has been applied on New England 39-bus test system, and the results show the efficiency of the proposed PMU placement and fault location methods in the network with the uncertainty of parameters.
Performance assessment of swarm-assisted mean error estimation-based fault detection technique for transmission line protection
 In this paper, a fast and computationally efficient fault detection algorithm is proposed for power transmission network protection using mean error estimation technique. In order to avoid false detection, instead of adopting the traditional trial and error-based approach, particle swarm optimization-assisted optimal threshold setting method is introduced in this paper. Performance of the proposed fault detection technique is tested for numerous fault and non-fault events generated on a two-bus test power system through MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The observations on results clearly show that using the proposed method even critical faults can be detected securely within a quarter cycle of the 50 Hz power system. The comparative assessment with two existing methods confirms the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
Transmission lines fault location using transient signal spectrum
 This paper proposes a method for fault location on transmission lines, which is based on time to frequency domain transformation of transient signals of the fault instant measured at one end. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used for time to frequency domain transformation and frequency of the first fault generated harmonic is utilised for determination of the fault location using the travelling wave theory of the transmission line. The accuracy of the method has been tested using the simulations carried out in Alternative Transients Program (ATP/EMTP) with frequency-dependent distributed parameter transmission line model by considering several cases and various types of faults, different values of fault resistance and phase angle at fault instant. The method has good accuracy and the simulation results show that the accuracy of the method is insensitive to the fault resistance and phase angle of the fault instant. Reactive elements may affect the resolution but, it can be removed by applying the correction procedure proposed.
Online fault location on AC cables in underground transmission systems using sheath currents
 This paper studies online travelling wave methods for fault location on a crossbonded cable system using sheath currents. During the construction of the electrical connection to the 400 MW off shore wind farm Anholt, it was possible to perform measurements on a 38.4 km crossbonded cable system. At 31.4 km, all cables were accessible which made it possible to apply a fault using an arc free breaker and measure the travelling waves at each end of the cable. On a crossbonded cable system, the sheaths are short circuited and grounded at both ends. This makes possible the use of low voltage Rogowski coils if the sheath currents contain the necessary information for accurate fault location. In this paper, this is examined by analysis of field measurements and through a study of simulations. The wavelet transform and a visual inspection method are used and the accuracy is compared. Field measurements and simulations are compared for testing the reliability of using simulations for studying fault location methods.
Fault location method applied to transmission lines of general configuration
 Power quality is an important concern once automation is present in almost all industrial process. Since fault occurrences affects the power quality considerably, in this paper is proposed a new fault location method applied to transmission lines constituted of any configuration, as example double circuit, untransposed sections, and multiple derivations. In order to locate the fault, the method uses voltage and current phasors gathered from terminals with measures, however the method does not need these measures from all terminals. The proposed method is composed of three blocks to locate the fault, which are: Algorithm’s Main Control, Grid Scanning Process, and Objective Function’s Minimization Process. A large number of simulations were conducted and the results show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, even in cases of high impedance faults.

 Fault analysis in transmission and distribution system is an important requirement to safeguard the power system. Fault analysis in a system is carried out for proper choice of protective relaying components in the transmission and distribution system. In addition, an estimate is made regarding the characteristics of the fault for protection by circuit breaker. In order to study the complete performance of faults on transmission lines, the variation of damping coefficient and DC offset of the system is discussed. In this paper, a single phase to ground fault is simulated. The short circuit currents are calculated by simulating faults at various points on the wave of supply and at various distances to account for fault current, damping and DC offset.

An intelligent algorithm for fault location on VSC-HVDC system
 This paper proposes a novel intelligent algorithm for fault location on the voltage sourced converter-high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system. This method with single-ended measurement makes full use of frequency, time and energy to capture the fault features via Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The time delay, characteristic frequency, energy attenuation and high-frequency energy are used as the input of ε-support vector regression (SVR) to get fault distance. Then bat algorithm (BA) optimizes the parameters of the model with cross validation comparing with other optimization algorithm. Furthermore, high-frequency variance contribution rate (HVCR) is adopted to identify the fault area. The VSC-HVDC simulation system is constructed to verify the reliability and accuracy of the method and the expected accuracy of the proposed method is ±500 m. The results demonstrated that the proposed method still has reliability and accuracy for hybrid transmission line with a small amount of data.
A new methodology for multiple incipient fault diagnosis in transmission lines using QTA and Naïve Bayes classifier
 Transmission lines’ monitoring systems are hybrid-dynamical structures produce a large amount of data that renders faults diagnosis difficult. Moreover, multiple faults of unknown nature can occur simultaneously impeding their discrimination. In addition, the feature extraction step constitutes an inherent limitation to the diagnosis of multiple faults. Indeed, a feature extraction algorithm avoiding any masking effect among between different multiple faults is hard to devise. This paper proposes a methodology dedicated to the diagnosis of multiples faults in transmission lines using both and experimental and calculated Leakage Current (LC) signals’ harmonics as residuals. Measured data from the real transmission line was used to modelling normal operating mode. Besides, different scenarios, including insulator chains contamination with different types and concentrations of pollutants were modeled by equivalents circuits to generate a multiple faults scenario. LCs from deteriorated insulators were inserted in the transmission line normal operating mode to implement a faulty operating conditions model. Qualitative trend analysis (QTA) was used to generate primitives and by exploiting the leakage current difference between normal and faulty operating conditions to define a features extraction algorithm for the diagnosis of specific fault modes. A Naïve Bayes classifier was designed in order to identify the most prominent fault in a multiple faults scenario by means of LC data. The methodology manages to split multiple faults into single faults and reaches a classification accuracy for multiple faults of 95%.
A performance oriented impedance based fault location algorithm for series compensated transmission lines
 This paper proposes a performance oriented fault location algorithm for series compensated transmission lines. The algorithm estimates the fault location based on the calculated fault voltage and current using two end measurements and line parameters. Fault location computations are carried out considering faults existed before or after the compensator location on the line. The calculated MOV impedance is the key factor in determining whether or not the fault is located in front of the compensator. A 380 kV transmission line with a series capacitor and an MOV has been tested for various fault types, fault locations and fault resistances. The results show that the algorithm accurately estimates the fault location for all cases.
Detection and classification of internal faults in bipolar HVDC transmission lines based on K-means data description method
 This paper proposes a novel protection scheme for detection and classification of internal faults in bipolar HVDC transmission lines using the K-means data description (KMDD) method. In the proposed protection scheme, the inverter-side dc voltage and current signals are utilized. Relatively short-time windows are considered for these signals, and the sum values of data windows are calculated. In the preparation stage, for each dc fault type, the KMDD method is applied to some post-fault data generated in various conditions. Then, the obtained centroids and thresholds are used for detecting and classifying new internal dc faults even with unseen conditions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 4320 internal and 2816 external fault cases in a 1000 km bipolar overhead HVDC transmission line under various conditions not seen in the preparation stage. Besides simplicity and low sampling frequency requirement of the proposed protection scheme, the obtained results show that it is fast and accurate enough for the internal dc faults, and also it is stable during the external ac faults and the pre-fault normal conditions.
A new single ended fault location algorithm for combined transmission line considering fault clearing transients without using line parameters
 In this paper a new single ended fault location method is proposed for underground cable combined with overhead lines. In this algorithm fault clearing high frequency transients are used instead of fault-generated transients and the line parameters are not needed. In the proposed algorithm, samples just from voltage transients generated by fault clearing action of circuit breaker are taken from the sending end of the cable line. Applying wavelet transform, the first three inceptions of traveling waves to the fault locator are detected. Using these, the proposed algorithm at first identifies fault section, overhead or cable, and then wave speed is calculated and at last location of fault is determined accurately. Because of using only voltage samples taken from one terminal, it is simple and economic and does not need to GPS and data communication and synchronization. Extensive simulations carried out using SimPowerSystem toolbox of MATLAB, confirm the capabilities and high accuracy of the proposed method under different system and fault conditions.
A new algorithm for fault location in series compensated transmission lines with TCSC
 In this paper a new algorithm for accurate fault location in advanced series compensated transmission lines with Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) is presented. Time domain modeling of a transmission line and the TCSC system are used in the proposed algorithm. This algorithm consists of two subroutines considering faults in the line sections i.e. in front of TCSC and behind it. Subroutines selection in the algorithm is performed by using a parameter known as the Fault Section Indicator (FSI). FSI is, in fact, the virtual resistance of the TCSC measured during the first cycle of fault inception. The one-cycle FSI trend indicates the faulty section, and an accurate method is adopted for fault location estimation. Extensive simulations were carried out using ATP-EMTP software on a 400 kV, 300 km transmission system with the TCSC installed in the middle of the line. The results confirm the capability of the FSI parameter for correct identification of faulty section and the accuracy of the proposed fault location algorithm.
A new wavelet based fault detection, classification and location in transmission lines
 This paper deals with the application of wavelet transforms for the detection, classification and location of faults on transmission lines. A Global Positioning System clock is used to synchronize sampling of voltage and current signals at both the ends of the transmission line. The detail coefficients of current signals of both the ends are utilized to calculate fault indices. These fault indices are compared with threshold values to detect and classify the faults. Artificial Neural Networks are employed to locate the fault, which make use of approximate decompositions of the voltages and currents of local end. The proposed algorithm is tested successfully for different locations and types of faults.
Fault location on transmission lines little longer than half-wavelength
 AC transmission lines little longer than half-wavelength have been widely investigated as an alternative for bulk power transmission in power networks where the generation plants are very distant from the load centers. However, studies regarding the performance of fault location methods applied to this type of line have not been done. In this paper, two contributions are presented. First, it is shown that conventional impedance-based fault location methods may fail to correctly identify the fault point even when the line shunt capacitance effect is taken into account. Then, to overcome this drawback, an innovative two-terminal impedance-based fault location algorithm is proposed. The algorithm considers the distributed parameter line model with line shunt capacitances thereby is able to reliably identify and correct erroneous fault point estimations that arise due to atypical operational features of this particular type of transmission line. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out by means of Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) simulations, from which a wide variety of faults in a 1000 kV AC transmission line 2613 km long is analyzed. The obtained results indicate high reliability of the proposed algorithm, which is almost insensitive to the fault characteristics, power system load flow, power factor and line transposition schemes.
Methodology for testing a parameter-free fault locator for transmission lines
 This paper presents a comparison between two different approaches to fault location both with and without utilising transmission line parameters. Firstly, an impedance-based parameter-dependent algorithm, derived by using modal transformation theory and fast Fourier transform is presented. The methodology is able to locate the fault whether it is on an overhead line or on an underground power cable. The second algorithm is a parameter-free fault location method that uses time synchronised data. Here, the unknown fault location is determined from voltage and current phasors, synchronously measured at both line terminals. This approach to fault location avoids the requirement for prior knowledge of line parameters, which is advantageous as line parameters are not always known precisely. This paper presents the results of algorithm testing through the use of ATPDraw simulations and MATLAB. The results were validated through laboratory experiments. The results of the line parameter-free model are compared with those from the parameter-dependent model. Both algorithms were tested for single line to ground faults.
A fault location criterion for MTDC transmission lines using transient current characteristics
 Multi-terminal DC (MTDC) transmission system is applied in modern power systems due to its technical features. In an MTDC system, the converter stations are generally connected in parallel. To smooth the DC current output from the converter, the smoothing reactors are integrated in the converter outputs, instead of in the DC transmission line. When a fault occurs on the DC transmission line of the MTDC system, the fault current will flow along the whole DC line. As a result, the protection scheme may not locate the fault accurately. Based on the characteristics of DC filter, this paper analyzes the impedance characteristics of the combinational circuits, and proposes a method to identify the fault location by the characteristic harmonic. A protection criterion of the non-integer harmonics comparison is composed with phase-frequency characteristics curve derived from complex wavelet transform. The inevitable blind zone is analyzed in theory which exists on the terminal of transmission lines just like distance protection in AC systems. The algorithm is successfully tested and compared with other techniques.
New accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission lines using local measurements
 This paper presents a new accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission lines based on the distributed parameter line model. The new method requires only voltages and currents from one end of parallel lines. Based on sequence networks and boundary conditions, equations can be derived to obtain the fault location. The new method fully considers shunt capacitance of the line, and mutual impedance and mutual admittance between the lines by using accurate model for both positive- and zero- sequence circuits, and obviates the need of iterative process to compensate for the capacitance. The method is independent of fault resistance, remote infeed and source impedances. EMTP simulation studies have been conducted to generate fault cases under various fault conditions to validate the proposed method. The results have shown that the developed algorithm can achieve highly accurate fault location estimates.
A novel single-phase-to-earth fault location method for distribution network based on zero-sequence components distribution characteristics
 Based on distribution characteristics of the zero-sequence voltages and currents of the distributed lines, this paper proposes a novel single-phase-to-earth fault (SPTEF) location scheme for distribution network. Firstly, the distributed parameter model of distribution feeder lines is appropriately simplified according to Taylor series expansion of the hyperbolic functions in the model. The fault factor is constructed to select the faulted feeder. Then, the distribution features of the zero-sequence voltage (ZV) along the feeder line are analyzed. In each section of the faulted feeder, golden section search algorithm is adopted to distinguish the faulted section. Finally, based on the concept of maximum fault current, accurate fault location is realized by genetic algorithm (GA). A radial distribution network model containing different types of distribution lines is established in PSCAD/EMTDC. The calculation results of MATLAB prove the validity, reliability and accuracy of the proposed fault location scheme.
Fault location scheme for a multi-terminal transmission line based on current traveling waves
 As very little research on the fault location for multi-terminal transmission lines based on current traveling waves only has been done, a new fault location scheme on this is proposed. The proposed scheme is different from the traditional ones based on fundamental impedance. Fast Intrinsic Mode Decomposition (FIMD) and Teager Energy Operator (TEO) are combined (FIMD&TEO) to detect the arrival time of the traveling wave at each terminal. Fault Distance Ratio Matrix (FDRM) and rules for identifying faulted sections of a multi-terminal transmission line are proposed and the method for building FDRM is presented in this paper. After several couples of local and remote terminals connecting through the faulted section are got, their fault distances are calculated by means of a two-ended traveling wave method, and then the fault point can be located by averaging the fault distances. Many simulations under various fault conditions have been done, and the results show that the proposed scheme can locate faults more accurately than existing impedance-based methods.
Generalized neural network and wavelet transform based approach for fault location estimation of a transmission line
 To maintain the efficient and reliable operation of power systems, it is extremely important that the transmission line faults need to be detected and located in a reliable and accurate manner. A number of mathematical and intelligent techniques are available in the literature for estimating the fault location. However, the results are not satisfactory due to the wide variation in operating conditions such as system loading level, fault inception instance, fault resistance and dc offset and harmonics contents in the transient signal of the faulted transmission line. Keeping in view of aforesaid, a new approach based on generalized neural network (GNN) with wavelet transform is presented for fault location estimation. Wavelet transform is used to extract the features of faulty current signals in terms of standard deviation. Obtained features are used as an input to the GNN model for estimating the location of fault in a given transmission systems. Results obtained from GNN model are compared with ANN and well established mathematical models and found more accurate.
A new FDOST entropy based intelligent digital relaying for detection, classification and localization of faults on the hybrid transmission line
 The paper presents a new digital relaying for detection, classification and localization of faults on the hybrid transmission line consisting of an overhead line and an underground cable. The entropy principle together with fast discrete orthogonal S-transform (FDOST) represented by window dependent bases is utilized for feature extraction and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier model & support vector regression (SVR) model are employed for pattern recognitions to predict the types and locations of faults. After modelling and simulation of the transmission system in Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) software, three phase fault current signals are recorded at one end of the line to extract entropy of FDOST coefficients from each of the three current signals of half cycle duration after fault initiation. The proposed relaying technique is tested on a single-junction and a multi-junction hybrid transmission lines under different fault conditions and is found fast and accurate independent of fault type, fault section, fault resistance, fault inception angle (FIA) and load angle. Another important aspect of the method is that it needs no prior identification of the faulty section for the estimation of fault location. The immunity of the proposed method to noise is also established by testing it with fault current signals impregnated with white Gaussian noise of level 30 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR).
A closed-form solution for transmission line fault location using local measurements at a remote substation
 This paper presents a novel approach for fault location of overhead transmission lines by voltage and current measurements in a remote substation. The method is applicable when not all of the transmission lines in an area are equipped with fault-locators, although there may be a critical substation (CS) in the area equipped with a digital fault recorder (DFR). In the proposed method, the circuit equations of the network are used to find the transfer function between the fault location and each voltage and current measurement in the CS. Next, two auxiliary variables are defined to transform the nonlinear fault location estimation problem into a linear least squares problem. A closed-form solution is then obtained for fault location. The proposed formulation obviates the need to use unsynchronized or synchronized measurements from any other substation. Moreover, the proposed formulation does not necessitate fault type classification or fault resistance estimation. Furthermore, the distributed parameter model of the transmission line is considered in order for the method to be applicable to long transmission lines. Electromagnetic transient simulations for a 15-bus test system confirm accurate fault location estimation on remote transmission lines for different critical substations considered in the network.
New smart fault locator in compensated line with UPFC
 In this paper, a new smart fault locator in a compensated transmission line with a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is proposed. Three types of features are extracted from the captured fault signals at one-end of the compensated line by using a time-frequency signal processing tool known as the Hyperbolic S-Transform (HST). The HST, with an asymmetrical window, is an improved version of the S-transform. Then, the regression model of the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a non-linear kernel function is applied for the fault location estimation. The proposed smart fault locator gives accurate estimation results by involving hidden statistical features which comprise a new type of time-frequency features. The evaluation of the features and the estimation error obtained under different conditions confirm the efficacy of the proposed smart fault locator.
All shunt fault location including cross-country and evolving faults in transmission lines without fault type classification
 This paper presents a fault location algorithm which does not need to classify the fault type before location estimation unlike some fault location methods. All types of shunt fault including the cross-country and evolving faults can be located and also faulty phase can be identified with this scheme. Cross-country fault is defined as earth fault occurring in different phases of same circuit at different location at same or different time. Further evolving faults are faults beginning in one phase and spreading to another phase after a few cycles. Finding the exact location of cross-country faults and evolving faults is not easy because the first involves faults at two different locations and the later involves change in type of fault after few cycles. The standard deviation of approximate DWT coefficients of three phase currents and voltages measured at one terminal of the line are used as input to proposed ANN algorithm. The simulation results show the efficacy and suitability of the proposed scheme under wide variety of fault situation and the percentage error in fault location estimation using the proposed scheme is within ±1% in most of the cases. The distinct advantage of the proposed scheme is that it accurately locates all the normal shunt faults, cross-country faults and evolving faults, which has not been dealt by other researchers simultaneously.
Wavelet-alienation based protection scheme for multi-terminal transmission line
 This paper presents a wavelet-alienation based protection scheme for multi-terminal transmission system. The proposed algorithm makes use of wavelet transform based approximate coefficients of three-phase voltage and current signals, obtained over a quarter cycle to detect, classify and locate various faults. Detection and classification of faults are achieved with the help of approximate coefficients based alienation coefficients of current signals, measured from all the buses of system. The approximate coefficients of voltage and current signals, obtained over a quarter cycle, are fed to artificial neural network to locate the faults precisely, from respective buses. This algorithm has been tested successfully for all the types of faults with variations in location, inception angle and fault impedance. The proposed protection scheme is generalized for N-terminal system followed by successful testing on three-terminal and five-terminal systems.
An enhanced fault detection and location estimation method for TCSC compensated line connecting wind farm
 The paper presents a new approach to enhance the fault detection, and location determination based on travelling waves using Fast Discrete S-transform (FDST) for TCSC compensated lines connecting to wind farm. The FDST is applied to the modal components of measured currents at each terminal to detect the arrival time of the first travelling wave (transient) produced by the fault. The proposed method includes detecting the terminal with fastest arrival time of wave to identify the faulted section and estimate the fault location by using proper distance index. The simulation results have demonstrated good performance of the proposed scheme under different fault locations, fault resistances, fault inception angles, fault types, faulted sections, variations in TCSC parameters and changing wind speeds. The performance validation on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) platform enhances the applicability of the proposed protection scheme for the TCSC based compensated line integrated with wind farm. The performance comparison with the conventional travelling wave fault location algorithms using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) shows potential ability of the proposed method.
A review on fault classification methodologies in power transmission systems: Part—I
 This paper presents a survey on different fault classification methodologies in transmission lines. Efforts have been made to include almost all the techniques and philosophies of transmission lines reported in the literature. Fault classification is necessary for reliable and high speed protective relaying followed by digital distance protection. Hence, a suitable review of these methods is needed. The contribution consists of two parts. This is part 1 of the series of two parts. Part 1, it is a review on brief introduction on faults in transmission lines and the scope of various old approaches in this field are reviewed. Part 2 will focus and present a newly developed approaches in this field.
A new methodology of fault location for predictive maintenance of transmission lines
 This paper presents a new methodology for monitoring, in real-time, the conditions of the insulation of an power transmission line, detecting and locating anomalies in its operation, before the supply of power is interrupted, thus allowing for preventive maintenance. This method uses the harmonic decomposition of the leakage current to analyze the condition of line insulation and employs a neural network to locate the fault. Experimental measurements were obtained to validate the simulated results.
Transmission Line Fault Detection and Identification in an Interconnected Power Network using Phasor Measurement Units
 This paper proposes a novel hybrid technique to detect and identify transmission line faults in an Interconnected Network using the measurements from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). The proposed fault detection and identification technique is based on Positive Sequence voltage and current measurement from PMUs. The proposed algorithm for fault detection and identification is deployed in two stages: First stage is the detection of fault using Positive Sequence Voltage Magnitude (PSVM) and second stage is the fault-location identification through Positive Sequence Current Angle Differences (PSCADs). Sometimes, both of these condition might fail to detect and identify the fault, then another condition based on Positive Sequence Current Magnitude (PSCM) is employed. The proposed hybrid technique for fault detection and fault line identification is tested on a five area interconnected transmission network that employs PMUs at its buses/nodes. During fault, the sequence of PSVM near the faulty line changes or its value drops to minimum, thus detecting the fault. If the PSVM condition fails, then fault is detected by observing sequence and magnitudes of PSCM at all the buses. Fault identification is performed by comparing the PSCAD (Positive Sequence Current Angle Difference) of corresponding node with PSCADs of remaining nodes and maximum PSCAD identifies the faulty line. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK and results are given for the five area power system. The results verify the proposed fault detection and identification algorithm.
A multiple model filtering approach to transmission line fault diagnosis
 This paper provides justification and implementation for a multiple model filtering approach to diagnosis of transmission line three-phase short to ground faults in the presence of protection misoperations. This approach utilizes the electric network dynamics and wide area measurements to provide diagnosis outcomes. A second focus of this paper is on the reduction of computational complexity of the diagnosis algorithm. This issue is addressed by a two-step heuristic. The first step designs subsystem models through measurement selection. The second step reduces the dynamic model order. The performance of the diagnosis algorithms are evaluated on a simulated WSCC 9-bus system.
Fault location in a series compensated transmission line based on wavelet packet decomposition and support vector regression
 This paper proposes a novel transmission line fault location scheme, combining wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and support vector regression (SVR). Various types of faults at different locations, fault resistance and fault inception angles on a series compensated 400 kV–285.65 km power system transmission line are investigated. The system only utilizes a single-end measurements. WPD is used to extract distinctive fault features from 1/2 cycle of post fault signals after noises have been eliminated by a low pass filter, and SVR is trained with features obtained from WPD. After training, SVR was then used in precise location of fault on the transmission line. The result shows that fault location on transmission line can be determined rapidly and correctly irrespective of fault impedance.
Detection, classification, and location of faults in power transmission lines
 This paper presents a pattern recognition approach for current differential relaying of power transmission lines. The current differential method uses spectral energy information provided through a new Fast Discrete S-Transform (FDST). Unlike the conventional S-Transform (ST) technique the new one uses different types of frequency scaling, band pass filtering, and interpolation techniques to reduce the computational cost and remove redundant information. Further due to its low computational complexity, the new algorithm is suitable for real-time implementation. The proposed scheme is evaluated for current differential protection of a transmission line fed from both ends for a variety of faults, fault resistance, inception angles, and significant noise in the signal using computer simulation studies. Also the fundamental amplitude and phase angle of the two end currents and one end voltage are computed with the help of the new formulation to provide fault location with significant accuracy. The results obtained from the exhaustive computation show the feasibility of the new approach.
Tree-related high impedance fault location using phase shift measurement of high frequency magnetic field
 Tree-related high impedance faults (THIFs) are one complex type of high impedance faults which occurs when power lines come in contact with live vegetation. These faults could not cause the overhead line to be removed by power line over-current protection during the first cycles. But if the fault current continue to flow through the vegetation, the THIF will eventually go to flashover. Furthermore, the physical changes created by a transient THIF current flowing through the vegetation are irreversible. So, if subsequently a THIF again occurs on the previous vegetation, the fault current goes directly to flashover and line tripping after a very brief delay. Consequently, the failure to early location of THIFs may results in blackout. Therefore, determining the exact distance of the THIFs efficiently contributes to increase reliability of power systems. Given that available high-impedance fault location techniques are not fully effective in the case of a THIF, the need for a more accurate method seems obvious. So in this paper, a novel single-terminal location method based on noncontact magnetic field strength measurement is proposed for THIFs. Suggested technique determines the exact distance of the THIF fault from the sensing point based on the total phase shift of the high frequency component of the magnetic field strength in the plane perpendicular to the conductor axis. Indeed, this study is a follow up to a previous study (Bahador et al., 2017).
A review on fault classification methodologies in power transmission systems: Part-II
 The countless extent of power systems and applications requires the improvement in suitable techniques for the fault classification in power transmission systems, to increase the efficiency of the systems and to avoid major damages. For this purpose, the technical literature proposes a large number of methods. The paper analyzes the technical literature, summarizing the most important methods that can be applied to fault classification methodologies in power transmission systems. The part 2 of the article is named “A review on fault classification methodologies in power transmission systems”. In this part 2 we discussed the advanced technologies developed by various researchers for fault classification in power transmission systems.
A novel single end measuring system based fast identification scheme for transmission line faults
 This paper proposes a novel single end measuring system for fast fault identification in transmission lines (TL). The proposed scheme combines the merits of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Karen Bell Transformation (KBT) for the fault analysis process. The proposed scheme is independent on threshold value. The proposed algorithm tested on a 350 km, 500 kV transmission line for different fault types using ATP/EMTP simulation package. Critical issues like a variation in fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle and different source capacities are validated using the proposed scheme. The scheme extracts distinctive fault features over 1/16 of a cycle data windows with sampling frequency 6.4 kHz. The proposed scheme detects and classifies the fault using only 8 samples from power cycle and the average of fault detection time is 1.25 ms. The obtained results indicate that the developed scheme is fast, reliable, robust compared to the previous works in the literature.
Gear fault diagnosis using transmission error and ensemble empirical mode decomposition
 Classification of spall and crack faults of gear teeth is studied by applying the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to the transmission error (TE) measured by the encoders of the input and output shafts. Finite element models of the gears with the two faults are built, and TE’s are obtained by simulation of the faulty gears under loaded contact to identify the different characteristics. A simple test bed for a pair of spur gears is prepared to illustrate the approach, in which the TE’s are measured for the gears with seeded spall and crack, respectively. EEMD is applied to extract fault features under the noise from the measured TE. The differences of the spall and crack are clearly identified by the selected features of the intrinsic mode functions based on the class separability criterion. The k-nearest neighbor method is applied for the classification of the faults and normal gears using the features. The proposed method is advantageous over the existing practices in the sense that the TE signal measures the gear faults more directly with less noise, enabling successful diagnosis.
Automatic lightning stroke location on transmission lines using data mining and synchronized initial travelling
 The automatic location of lightning stroke impact point on transmission lines is one of the most crucial factors related to the behavior of Electric Power Systems, which can improve the swift recovery of electric power. The usual location of this phenomenon has been based on distance protection relays, which requires operation times of approximately one cycle. This paper presents a high-speed protection approach for the lightning-caused transient automated location on transmission lines or on ground. This work is based on the synchronized initial voltage-travelling waves at both ends of high voltage transmission lines. Lightning strikes at different sections along the 220 kV transmission line are detected at both protection relays by using an algorithm based on the ellipsoidal pattern previously presented in another research project. That methodology uses the projection of original signals. Thus, if these signals are located along the ellipsoidal pattern, the electric power system is operated under normal conditions. Unlike the aforementioned case, if the projected signals are located outside of the ellipsoidal pattern, it represents the presence of lightning strokes. After those signals are detected, initial voltage traveling waves measured by protection relays located at both ends of the transmission line are used in order to localize the lighting stroke impact point. At the instant that a lightning stroke hits either on the phase conductor or the ground, travelling waves propagate along the transmission line. Later on, depending on the impact point of atmospheric discharges, different time instances, which the travelling waves require to arrive at their respective ends, are determined. These times are used to calculate the distance from the impact point to both protection relays. Therefore, this paper presents a concise simple methodology for lightning stroke location on transmission lines or ground based in data mining to perform the signal detection and travelling wave times to determine the location along the transmission line. Simulations of lightning stroke signals on a 220 kV transmission line are carried out in the Alternative Transients Program (ATP). The results show that the behavior of the work is swift and effective in order to locate the impact point, especially in situations where flash current values, inception angles, distances from the impact point to protection relays, direct and indirect lightning and other factors, are considered, since it is immune to flash currents and other features. Finally, the proposed work could be considered as an alternative routine for protection relay algorithms
A state estimation approach for fault location in transmission lines considering data acquisition errors and non-synchronized records
 The performance of algorithms for fault location is directly related to the accuracy of its input data. Thus, factors such as errors in the line parameters, failures in synchronization of oscillographic records and errors in measurements of voltage and current can significantly influence the accuracy of algorithms that use bad data to indicate the faults location. This paper presents a methodology for fault location based on the theory of state estimation in order to determine the location of faults more accurately by considering realistic systematic errors that may be present in measurements of voltage and current. The methodology developed is innovative because, besides calculating the most likely fault distance obtained from measurement errors, the variance associated with the distance found is also determined, using the errors theory. The obtained results are relevant to show that the proposed estimation approach works even adopting realistic variances. Moreover, the fault location brings performance gains compared to a traditional algorithm, available in the literature.
One-end fault location method for untransposed four-circuit transmission lines
 This paper presents a fault location method suitable for untransposed four-circuit parallel transmission lines using the data available at one end of the line. The proposed method employs an accurate distributed parameter line model that fully accounts for mutual coupling between all the lines and shunt capacitance effects. The fault location algorithms are developed in phase-components, one for the case where the fault is in any one of the circuits, the second for the case where the fault involves any two circuits and the third for the case where the fault involves more than two circuits. The proposed method is tested using the transient data obtained by simulating a 500-kV four-circuit overhead transmission line under different fault conditions. The simulations are done using the software “DIgSILENT PoweFactory”. Results obtained indicate that the method is capable of estimating the fault distance with high accuracy for various fault conditions. Also the robustness of the fault location method is investigated.
A study on accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission line with a teed connection
 Teed connecting parallel transmission lines frequently subject a variety of technical problems in the view of protection engineering. These problems are mainly due to the mutual coupling between lines and the multiple branch of teed connection, which requires choosing faulted branch before fault location. A new accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission line with a teed connection is introduced in this paper. Depending on six-sequence fault component method, the coupled transmission equations are transformed into decoupled ones. Based on the detailed analysis of peculiar characteristic of teed connection, the differential positive sequence component measurement, which is one of the six-sequence fault components, is used to implement fault location for parallel line with a teed connection. The new location algorithm makes full use of the decoupled mode and the teed structure. It is independent of source impedance, fault type, fault resistance and mutual coupling between parallel lines. The algorithm has been tested by EMTP simulations, which indicates that this location method obtains high accuracy under various fault conditions.
Fault location on transmission lines using complex-domain neural networks
 Fault location is a critical task when a severe disturbance is caused by insulation failure on a transmission line. In order to avoid further economical and social costs because of load interruptions, the fault diagnosis has to be concluded as soon as possible. Intelligent systems have been successful in dealing with fault diagnosis problems. This paper proposes the application of complex-domain neural networks for mapping the relationship between electrical signals and fault locations on transmission lines. Complex-domain neural networks allow voltage/current representation without arbitrarily decoupling amplitude and phase. Furthermore, several voltage and current representation schemes, based on electromagnetic transient and steady-state information, are analyzed in this paper. For comparison purpose, these input representations are also tested with real-domain neural networks. The tests consider realistic operating/fault conditions and assume that fault classification has already been handled.
A hybrid method for fault location estimation in a fixed series compensated lines
 This paper proposes a fault distance estimation scheme for fixed series capacitor compensated parallel transmission lines using discrete wavelet transform and decision tree regression. The purpose of the data mining based scheme is to avoid the complicated equation based methods that have been suggested by researchers to overcome the drawbacks of conventional fault location scheme. Although decision tree has inherent advantage over other methods like artificial neural network and support vector machines to work with large data sets, it has not been used in fault location estimation in series compensated (SC) transmission line so far. Decision tree is chosen to locate the faults because of its ability to work with large data set and high accuracy in associating the fault pattern to the fault distance using regression analysis. The discrete wavelet transform processed signals makes the decision process of decision tree regression easy by providing appropriate features. The proposed method is evaluated with variation of fault location, fault type, pre-fault load angle, location of series capacitor, degree of series compensation, fault inception angle, line parameters, inter-circuit faults and fault resistance. The test result of decision tree regression based location estimation scheme ensures that, it can estimate the fault distance accurately.
New algorithm for detection and fault classification on parallel transmission line using DWT and BPNN based on Clarke’s transformation
 This paper presents a new algorithm for fault detection and classification using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) based on Clarke’s transformation on parallel transmission. Alpha and beta (mode) currents generated by Clarke’s transformation were used to convert the signal of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to get the wavelet transform coefficients (WTC) and the wavelet energy coefficient (WEC). Daubechies4 (Db4) was used as a mother wavelet to decompose the high frequency components of the signal error. The simulation was performed using PSCAD/EMTDC for transmission system modeling. Simulation was performed at different locations along the transmission line with different types of fault and fault resistance, fault location and fault initial angle on a given power system model. Four statistic methods utilized are in the present study to determine the accuracy of detection and classification faults. The results show that the best Clarke transformation occurred on the configuration of 12-24-48-4, respectively. For instance, the errors using mean square error method, the errors of BPNN, Pattern Recognition Network and Fit Network are 0.03721, 0.13115 and 0.03728, respectively. This indicates that the BPNN results are the lowest error.
Fault location in transmission lines based on stationary wavelet transform, determinant function feature and support vector regression
 This paper proposes a novel transmission line fault location scheme, combining stationary wavelet transform (SWT), determinant function feature (DFF), support vector machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR). Various types of faults at different locations, fault impedance and fault inception angles on a 400 kV, 361.297 km transmission line are investigated. The system only utilizes single-end measurements. DFF is used to extract distinctive fault features from 1/4 cycle of post fault signals after noise and the decaying DC offset have been eliminated by a filtering scheme based on SWT. A classifier (SVM) and regression (SVR) schemes are subsequently trained with features obtained from DFF. The scheme is then used in precise location of fault on the transmission line. The result shows that fault location on transmission lines can be determined rapidly and correctly irrespective of fault impedance.

Simulation of the model was performed on SIMULINK by extracting initial inputs from SIMULINK to MATLAB, where the objective function specifies the fault location with a very high accuracy, precision and within a very short time. Future works are discussed showing the benefit behind using the Differential Learning TLBO (DLTLBO) was discussed as well.
A fault-location method for VSC-HVDC transmission lines based on natural frequency of current
 This paper presents a novel method for locating fault on VSC-HVDC transmission line using one terminal current data. The proposed method is developed based on the natural frequency of distributed parameter line model. In the presence of the large shunt capacitor at both terminals of the VSC-HVDC line, the high frequency traveling wave is approximately totally reflected at the terminals. It is found that the value of natural frequency of VSC-HVDC transmission line is only related to fault distance and wave speed. Using this characteristic, a single-end fault location method is developed. The natural frequency can be obtained by the PRONY algorithm. Compared with traveling wave method, this approach can use any section of the in-fault data to locate fault, without having to capture the instant at which wave-front arrives, which requires higher sampling rate. A short data window is sufficient for extracting natural frequency accurately in practice. The proposed method is verified using the frequency-dependent line model in EMTDC. The simulations have demonstrated validity, rapidity and accuracy of the proposed fault location algorithm.
A covariance indices based method for fault detection and classification in a power transmission system during power swing
 This paper presents a new scheme based on a combination of the current signals covariance with the cumulative approach to identify faults in the power transmission system during the power swing conditions. Primarily, the covariance is used to extract the features which are useful to identify the fault from the current signals that measured at both terminals. The cumulative approach is used to enlarge the fault feature and then create a convenient index for detection and classification during the power swing. The proposed algorithm has been tested through different fault circumstances such as multiple fault locations, multiple fault resistances, and multiple fault inception time. Moreover, fault happened nearby the terminal, fault considering variable loading angles, sudden load change, power flow direction change, faults in the presence of series compensation and fault occurred in the presence of noise are also considered. The empirical results show that the approach proposed in this study has made a reasonable time response, where the fault could be detected within a few milliseconds after the fault inception. Additionally, the simple computation process depicting our proposal makes it more suitable and efficient for practical engineering applications.

Accurate fault location algorithm for transmission line in the presence of series connected FACTS devices
 This paper presents a new and accurate fault location algorithm based on distributed time domain line model for a transmission line compensated with series connected FACTS device. In the proposed algorithm, in order to compute the voltage drop across the series device during the fault period, the series device model and knowledge about the operating mode of the compensating device are not utilized. For this reason, the proposed technique can be easily applied to any series FACTS compensated line. Samples of voltage and current at both ends of the line are taken synchronously and used to calculate the location and resistance of the fault. The proposed algorithm is not sensitive to fault resistance and fault inception angle and does not require any knowledge of equivalent source impedances. This method has been tested using EMTP/ATP model of a 400 kV, 300 km transmission line compensated with a series FACTS device. The results of computer simulations for different operating conditions demonstrate the very high accuracy and robustness of the algorithm.
Novel filter based ANN approach for short-circuit faults detection, classification and location in power transmission lines
 This paper presents a novel approach for detecting, classifying and locating short-circuit faults in power transmission lines. Based on the proposed approach, a hybrid framework consisting of a proposed two-stage finite impulse response (FIR) filter, four support vector machines (SVMs), and eleven support vector regressions (SVRs) is implemented in Proteus 6/MATLAB environments. The proposed two-stage FIR filter together with the SVMs are used to detect and classify short-circuit faults while the SVRs are utilized to locate short-circuit faults. The implemented framework needs few training samples for training the SVMs and SVRs. As will be shown, for a power transmission line with the length of 50 km, only 6 training samples are needed to train each SVR. The trained hybrid framework carries out the processes of fault detection, classification and location only during 1 cycle which is strictly shorter than the faults clearing time. It means that the proposed hybrid framework can rapidly detect, classify and locate short-circuit faults in power transmission lines before power outage carried out by protection relays. An actual three-phase 230 kV, 50 Hz power transmission line with the length of 50 km is simulated to validate the theoretical results and to verify the proposed technique accuracy.
A novel transmission line relaying scheme for fault detection and classification using wavelet transform and linear discriminant analysis
 This paper proposes fault detection and classification scheme for transmission line protection using WT and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Current signals of each phase are used for the detection and identification of faulty phases and zero sequence currents are used for the detection of ground. Current signals are processed using discrete wavelet transform with DB-4 wavelet up to level 3. Approximate coefficients are reconstructed using wavelet reconstruction. Performance of the proposed based scheme is tested by variations of parameters such as fault type, location, fault resistance, fault inception angle and power flow angle. The scheme is applicable for both single circuit and double circuit transmission line. All shunt faults and multi-location faults which occur in different locations at the same time are also detected and classified by the proposed scheme within one cycle time. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is not affected by non-linear high impedance fault and CT saturation.
A new faulty section identification and fault localization technique for three-terminal transmission line
 Owing to mal-operation of the conventional scheme during high resistance ground fault near tap point, a new faulty section identification and fault localization technique for three-terminal transmission line is presented in this paper. The proposed technique utilizes time-synchronized voltage and current signals from all the three terminals. Initially, fault detection based on estimation of superimposed voltage of tap point with reference to all three terminals has been carried out. Subsequently, utilizing the above three estimated superimposed voltages; faulty section identification criterion is formed. Finally, fault localization i.e. estimation of the value of fault distance and resistance has been performed. The authenticity of the proposed technique has been verified by simulating an existing 400 kV Indian three-terminal transmission network in PSCAD/EMTDC software. The simulation results point out that the proposed technique is able to identify the faulty section correctly. Moreover, it precisely estimates the value of fault distance and fault resistance as the percentage error for fault location and resistance remains within ±1.5% and ±3.5%, respectively. Likewise, its performance remains unaffected during wide variation in fault and system parameters. At the end, comparative evaluation of the proposed technique with the existing protection scheme clearly shows its superiority.

Data synchronization is carried out using post-fault data samples to increase the accuracy. The proposed algorithm is independent of the reference bus selection and is extensively tested for all major fault types and fault resistance variations. The results prove that the proposed algorithm yields accurate estimate of fault location.

Results revealed that the proposed fault location scheme can accurately calculate the location of a fault and successfully identify its type. The scheme has been also found to be effective for highly resistive fault with resistances of up to 500Ω. Further sensitivity analysis revealed that the proposed scheme is relatively robust to additive noise and synchronisation errors.
Supervised Learning-Based Fault Location in Power Grids
 In modern societies and with the introduction of “smart power grids,” customers are more sensitive to power outages. There are also more complex power transmission configurations to integrate renewable energy-based power generation at remote locations. Therefore, more efficient and accurate methods of fault location along these complex configurations are required, which target improving power supply restoration process, reducing the overall power outages time and costs, and enhancing end-users satisfaction. The availability of high-resolution/high-volume data, due to the proliferation of intelligent electronic devices in smart grids, paves ground to implement more accurate and intelligent fault location methods. This chapter presents a supervised-learning fault location method for complex power transmission lines by using high-resolution voltage and current measurements data. The fault location methods are developed for two complex high-voltage AC transmission systems, (1) three-terminal transmission lines, (2) hybrid transmission lines. The presented methodologies utilize discrete wavelet transform and support vector machine (SVM) as a supervised learning algorithm where the power system operating and fault conditions are taken into account through the learning steps of the SVM classifiers.
Application of Six-Sequence Fault Components in Fault Location for Joint Parallel Transmission Line
 A new fault location method based on six-sequence fault components was developed for parallel lines based on the fault analysis of a joint parallel transmission line. In the six-sequence fault network, the ratio of the root-mean square value of the fault current from two terminals is the function of the line impedance, the system impedance, and the fault distance away from the buses. A fault location equation is given to relate these factors. For extremely long transmission lines, the distributed capacitance is divided by the fault point and allocated to the two terminals of the transmission line in a lumped parameter to eliminate the influence of the distributed capacitance on the location accuracy. There is no limit on fault type and synchronization of the sampling data. Simulation results show that the location accuracy is high with an average error about 2%, and it is not influenced by factors such as the load current, the operating mode of the power system, or the fault resistance.
Application of Wavelet Technique for Fault Classification in Transmission Systems
 Transmission systems (TS) plays a major role in electrical power systems. The interruption caused to the consumer because of TS faults is substantial. So TS needs a proper protection scheme to ensure continuous power supply to the consumers. This study proposes a novel scheme using wavelet technique for classification of faults in TS. In order to do so, the proposed scheme uses current measurements of just one side of the transmission line. Simulations are performed under different fault conditions using MATLAB. The stability of the proposed scheme under various cases is tested andreliable results have been obtained.
Artificial Neural Network Based Fault Detection and Fault Location in the DC Microgrid
 In DC microgrid, power electronic devices may suffer from over current during short circuit faults. Since DC bus systems cannot sustain high fault currents, suitable protection strategy in DC lines is indispensable. This paper presents a novel use of artificial neural network (ANN) for fault detection and fault location in a low voltage DC bus microgrid system. In the proposed scheme, the faults on DC bus can be fast detected and then isolated without de-energizing the entire system, hence achieving a more reliable DC microgrid. The neural network is trained based on the different short circuit faults in DC bus to ensure its validity. A microgrid with ring DC bus, which is segmented into overlapping nodes and linked with circuit breakers, is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to test the performance of the protection scheme.
A wavelet-fuzzy combined approach for classification and location of transmission line faults
 This paper presents a real-time wavelet-Fuzzy combined approach for digital relaying. The algorithm for fault classification employs wavelet multi resolution analysis (MRA) to overcome the difficulties associated with conventional voltage and current based measurements due to effect of factors such as fault inception angle, fault impedance and fault distance. The proposed algorithm for fault location, different from conventional algorithms that are based on deterministic computations on a well-defined model to be protected, employs wavelet transform together with fuzzy logic. The wavelet transform captures the dynamic characteristics of the non-stationary transient fault signals using wavelet MRA coefficients. The fuzzy logic is employed to incorporate expert evaluation through fuzzy inference system (FIS) so as to extract important features from wavelet MRA coefficients for obtaining coherent conclusions regarding fault location. Computer simulations using MATLAB have been conducted for a 300 Km 400 KV line. Simulation results indicate that both the classification and localization algorithms are immune from effects of faults inception angle, impedance and distance. The most significant contribution of this paper is that the proposed location algorithm has a maximum error of 6.5% with a computational time of about one cycle. Thus both classification and location algorithms can be used as effective tools for real-time digital relaying purpose.
A Novel Methodology for Identifying Cross-Country Faults in Series-Compensated Double Circuit Transmission Lines
 In this paper, a competent mechanism for classifying cross-country faults in series-compensated (SC) double circuit transmission line (DCTL) is presented. Cross-country faults are usually different from frequently occurring short-circuit faults in the transmission system. The faults that strike up at the same time but on different positions in the transmission network and can involve same or different phases are termed as cross-country faults. An occurrence of such abnormality in the transmission network significantly hampered the functioning of traditional distance relaying. This paper presents a novel methodology for discriminating normal short-circuit faults and cross-country faults in SC double circuit power network based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and intelligent technique. The efficacy of the proposed mechanism for discriminating normal short-circuit faults and cross-country faults in the series-compensated DCTL system, various cases of normal short-circuit faults and cross-country faults (with varying system conditions) have been simulated in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). The results acquired after performing several test cases reveal the practicability of applying proposed EMD and intelligent techniques based mechanism for classification of cross-country faults from normal short-circuit abnormality in the transmission network.
Smarter Settings-Free Algorithm for Fault Location on Transmission Lines
 This paper presents a new smarter settings-free numerical algorithm for fault location on transmission lines. It does not require line parameters, which is a radical step forward compared to the existing approaches that require this information. Line parameters are only approximately constant; they differ with the loading and weather conditions. Thus, an approach which does not require them would be more robust, accurate and flexible than those approaches that do require line parameter information to determine the location to the fault. This is essential for the fast and secure elimination of faults on transmission lines and leads to a significant improvement in the quality of the energy supply. The new algorithm also does not require synchronously sampled data at the line terminals. The paper presents the results of the initial algorithm testing through the use of ATP-EMTP simulations.
One-end impedance based fault location in double-circuit transmission lines with different configurations
 A one-end impedance based fault location method suitable for double-circuit transmission lines with different end configurations is presented in this paper. The effect of mutual coupling of the circuits is taken care of in developing the algorithm. The method is developed in phase coordinates and hence it does not require the complicated six-order sequence component transformation. It is applicable to both symmetrical and unsymmetrical lines. Depending on the terminations at both ends of the line, eight different cases are discussed. The fault data required to evaluate the effectiveness of the method are obtained by simulating faults in different types of double circuit lines using MATLAB/Simulink. The accuracy of the proposed technique is evaluated by comparing the computed fault location with the actual fault location in the simulated models. It is shown that the method is accurate and robust for small errors in estimated equivalent source impedances.
Arc fault location: A nonlinear time varying fault model and frequency domain parameter estimation approach
 In this paper a frequency domain formulation for nonlinear arcing fault location is presented. The proposed fault location formulation uses as input data first cycles after the fault inception voltages and currents. The formulation is based on circuit analysis and a parameter estimation method. To consider the main characteristics of nonlinear arcing faults, a time varying resistance embedded in a nonlinear model is proposed and used. The formulation is developed for the case of the most frequent single line-to-ground faults using phase components. The effects of fault inception angle, time-varying series resistance, source impedance, load flow, sampling frequency and others factors are investigated and analyzed. This new approach was successfully tested through computer simulation and real data obtained from a Southern Brazilian Energy Utility. The proposed method was developed as dedicated software and is currently used by CEEE-GT.
Sparse voltage amplitude measurement based fault location in large-scale photovoltaic power plants
 Large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plants contain numerous transmission line branches and laterals inside. When a fault occurs conventional fault location methods face challenges due to the complex system structure and the diversity of PV inverter controls. Most of the published fault location methods cannot be directly used in the PV power plant due to the following issues: (1) Most of the fault location methods consider the PV inverter as a constant voltage source while the actual inverters have varied controls during faults. Without analysis of the unique fault transients of the PV, the fault location will suffer from errors. (2) In a complicated large-scale PV power plant with massive quantity of nodes, the synchronised measurements from all the nodes are almost impossible. A method with sparse un-synchronized measurements is required. Therefore, a new negative-sequence voltage amplitude sparse measurement based fault location method is proposed for unbalanced faults. The improved Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm is used to recover the sparse fault current vector and then determine the faulted node. Both the field testing and the simulation results indicate that the proposed method can locate the faulted nodes accurately and effectively without synchronizing measurement requirements from all the nodes. This method also presents a good performance for various unbalanced fault types, fault resistances, inverter controls and signal noise. All these factors make the propose method feasible for industrial applications.
Diagnosis and Location of the Open-circuit Fault in Modular Multilevel Converters: An Improved Machine Learning Method
 In this paper, the fault diagnosis and location (FDL) problem of the open circuit fault for modular multilevel converter (MMC) is investigated. A mixed kernel support tensor machine (MKSTM) is provided, and it’s employed to improve the support tensor machine which is an important algorithm of machine learning. By extracting the characteristic data of ac current and internal circulation current in either normal operation or open-circuit fault, then training and classifying the obtained samples with MKSTM, FDL of MMC can be realized with the supplied algorithm. Finally, experimental results show that the classification accuracy of MKSTM algorithm is improved observably than single kernel function STM such as linear, Radial Basis function (RBF), sigmoid and polynomial types. Synchronously, the open-circuit fault can be effectively diagnosed and located with the proposed method.
A comparison framework for distribution system outage and fault location methods
 Finding the location of faults in distribution networks has been a long standing problem for utility operators, and an interesting subject for researchers as well. In recent years, significant research efforts have been devoted to the development of methods for identification of the faulted area to assist utility operators in expediting service restoration, and consequently reducing outage time and relevant costs. Considering today’s wide variety of distribution systems, a solution preferred for a specific system might be impractical for another one. This paper provides a comparison framework which classifies and reviews a relatively large number of different fault location and outage area location methods to serve as a guide to power system engineers and researchers to choose the best option based on their existing system and requirements. It also supports investigations on the challenging and unsolved problems to realize the fields of future studies and improvements. For each class of methods, a short description of the main idea and methodology is presented. Then, all the methods are discussed in detail presenting the key points, advantages, limitations, and requirements.
Wavelet-based analysis and detection of traveling waves due to DC faults in LCC HVDC systems
 This paper presents qualitative and quantitative analysis of the traveling waves induced by faults on direct current (DC) transmission lines of line-commutated converter high-voltage direct current (LCC HVDC) systems for detecting the wavefront arrival times using the boundary wavelet coefficients from real-time stationary wavelet transform (RT-SWT). The qualitative analysis takes into account the steady-state operation and the detection of the inception times of both first and second wavefronts at the converter stations. The behavior of the boundary wavelet coefficients in DC transmission lines is examined considering the effects of the main parameters that influence the detection of the traveling waves, such as mother wavelets, sampling frequency, DC transmission line terminations, electrical noises, as well as fault resistance and distance. An algorithm designed to run in real-time and able to minimize the factors that hamper the performance of traveling wave-based protection (TWP) methods is proposed to detect the first and second surge arrival times. Quantitative results are achieved based on the accuracy of one- and two-terminal fault location estimation methods, and indicate the proper operation of the presented algorithm.
A threshold free synchrophasor measurement based multi-terminal fault location algorithm
 A new impedance based fault location algorithm is proposed for a generic multi-terminal transmission network consisting of a main line and tapped branches with no direct measurements available at the intermediate tapping nodes. The core of the algorithm is a threshold free faulted branch search algorithm that systematically compares the multiple estimates of voltages for the tapping nodes, computed using synchrophasor measurements at the terminals. Once the faulted branch is identified, multi-terminal fault location problem is reduced into a two-terminal fault location problem to determine the exact location of fault within the branch. The proposed algorithm is simple and does not involve resource intensive mathematical operations such as matrix inversion. The proposed algorithm was implemented as a module in an in-house developed real-time synchrophasor application software program, and its performance was evaluated using a test setup consisting of a real-time simulator, an actual synchrophasor network, and a phasor data concentrator. The tests showed that the proposed algorithm is capable of correctly determining the faulted branch, except for few faults that are very close to tapping nodes. When the algorithm is used with practical synchrophasor measurements, the fault location error was within a typical tower span for most cases.
HVDC Transmission Line Protection Based on Transient Power
 This paper presents a new protection method for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) system based on transient power. Behavior of the HVDC system during fault is studied. Variation of transient power and the relation between various parameters of the line are analyzed during each fault. Based on that the protection principle is developed. Transient power is obtained by measuring the voltage and current at the two terminals of the line. Identification of internal and external faults as well as location of DC lone fault can be done correctly and quickly from transient power. The test system is modeled using MATLAB - SIMULINK based on first CIGRE HVDC benchmark system.
A combined impedance and traveling wave based fault location method for multi-terminal transmission lines
 A new fault location method suitable for multi-terminal transmission lines that combines the advantages of both impedance and traveling wave based methods has been developed and presented in this paper. The proposed method first determines whether the fault is grounded or ungrounded by comparing the magnitude of the ground mode wavelet coefficients at the measurement end. Next, the impedance based method is used to identify the faulted half of the line in the case of two-terminal line and the faulted line section as well as the faulted half of the line section in the case of multi-terminal lines. Finally the fault location is determined by taking the time difference between the first two consecutive aerial modes of the current traveling waves observed at one end of the multi-terminal line. The proposed method has been tested on four- and five-terminal transmission lines with different types of faults, fault resistances and fault inception angles using ATP simulation.
Single phase fault location in electrical distribution feeder using hybrid method
 Restoration of electrical energy after each distribution feeder's outage can improve the reliability indices and its efficiency. Accurate fault locating can cause the Power distribution (PD) systems to restore rapidly. PD networks include many branches, laterals, sub-laterals and load taps. Thus, accurate fault locating is very complicated and important. In the present paper, a new combined method is proposed for locating the single-phase fault to earth in PD networks. An impedance-based fault-location algorithm is also used to find the possible fault locations. Then, the new method is proposed for determining the faulty section using voltage sag matching algorithm. In this method, after single-phase fault to ground, the possible locations of fault are determined by using the impedance-based fault-location algorithm. The same fault is simulated in possible locations, separately. The voltage, then, at the beginning of feeder is saved and amplitude and angle of the voltage differences are determined and online databank is generated. This databank is compared with the obtained and recorded amplitude and angle of the voltage differences for actual fault. The real location of fault is specified by the matching value of each possible fault location.
Preliminary assessment of the highest potential transmissivity of fractures in fault zones by core logging
 Fault zones are representative flow paths in rock masses, and the highest transmissivity of fractures in fault zones is important for conservative assessment of groundwater flow velocity for the purpose of radioactive waste disposal. Based on previous hydromechanical studies of fault zones, fault zones without tensile/hybrid damage-zone fractures are unlikely to have experienced faulting in a highly brittle manner, and the highest potential transmissivity of fractures in such fault zones is inferred to be relatively low (transmissivity (T) ≤ 10− 8 m2/s). To verify this inference, this study investigates the relationship between the failure mode (tensile/hybrid/shear) and the highest transmissivity of fractures in fault zones, using results from core logging and flowing-fluids electric conductivity (FFEC) logging in boreholes penetrating a Neogene siliceous mudstone (Wakkanai Formation) of the Horonobe area, northern Hokkaido, Japan. In 96% (35/36) of fault zones where tensile/hybrid fractures were not observed, the transmissivities of flow anomalies detected within the fault zones by FFEC logging are within the range of ≤ 10− 8 m2/s, whereas in 95% (145/153) of fault zones where tensile/hybrid fractures were observed, the transmissivities are within the range of ≥ 10− 8 m2/s. This result supports the above-mentioned inference, suggesting that core observations of whether tensile/hybrid fractures develop in fault zones allow preliminary assessment of the highest potential transmissivity of fractures in fault zones (i.e., potentially T ≥ 10− 8 m2/s or likely T ≤ 10− 8 m2/s). Such assessment increases the efficiency of hydrogeological borehole investigations of fault zones.
Fault location for power grid based on transient travelling wave data fusion via asynchronous voltage measurements
 Considering the complex topology of power grids and their important application, finding an effective fault location algorithm is mandatory. This paper presents a fault location method for power grid based on transient travelling wave data fusion and asynchronous voltage measurements. Firstly, the refraction regularity, attenuation rule and main factors affecting the amplitude of the initial travelling wave are analyzed. Then the modulus maxima of detail coefficients, treated as the feature variables of the initial travelling wave, are extracted via wavelet transform. At last, according to the configuration of the measuring points, fault location scheme based on data fusion theory is proposed. In data level fusion, phase-mode and wavelet transform are carried out in order to obtain the feature variables. In feature level fusion, the fault section is determined through the fault feature variables filtered by the network topology and the artificial neural network is used to fit the relationship between the fault distance and the time difference of arrival between single-terminal aerial-mode and zero-mode voltage. In decision level fusion, the double-terminal fault location algorithm based on the single-ended uploaded data is proposed. The IEEE 30-Bus System is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC and the fault location algorithm is carried out in MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrate that high-precision fault location could be realized and that practicality and economy are improved without requirements on synchronous sampling.
Energization simulations of a half-wavelength transmission line when subject to three-phase faults—Application to a field test situation
 The purpose of this paper is to supply technical data for the proposed field energization of 500 kV transmission lines present in the Brazilian interconnected system, forming a line, henceforth called AC-Link, slightly over a half-wavelength in 60 Hz. The purpose of the test is to investigate overvoltages and currents that result from the energization of the AC-Link. This paper shows the results of simulations performed in ATP (Alternative Transients Program) when considering the occurrence of three-phase faults along the AC-Link during energization. The results obtained show that, in certain situations, the overvoltages and energies in the arresters may reach very high values and some specific mitigation procedure should be implemented.
Advanced fault location strategy for modern power distribution systems based on phase and sequence components and the minimum fault reactance concept
 A generalized strategy for fault location in modern power distribution systems, which normally include distributed generation, is presented in this paper. The fault location method considers the phase and sequence network parameters and voltage and current measurements at the main substation and at the distributed generators, in pre-fault and fault steady states. The fault distance is estimated from the analysis of all section lines, which is required to determine if the fault is located in a radial or non-radial zone of the power distribution feeder; next, a specific equation is used to determine the exact location. The proposed methodology is validated in the IEEE 34-node test power system, where single-phase to ground, phase-to-phase and three-phase faults were tested, considering 51 different and optimally determined operational conditions. The proposed method has range of estimation errors from −2.8% to 3.2%.
Temperature safety analysis and backup protection scheme improvement for overhead transmission line in power oscillation condition
 The oscillating block module is usually adopted to avoid false action of distance protection of overhead transmission lines during power oscillation. However, this scheme ignores the safe operation of conductor temperature during oscillating block. This paper focuses on the conductor overheating problem and safety protection issue during power oscillation. Firstly, through analysis the differences in conductor temperature calculations under oscillating current, short-circuit current and normal load, a numerical iterative method of conductor temperature rise (CTR) calculation under power oscillating current is proposed using the transient thermal balance equation. Then, the safe operation scheme of transmission line is proposed by setting temperature alarm and temperature off-limit trip out. An improved backup protection based on the combination of temperature and impedance is proposed to avoid false action of distance protection, also provide overheating protection for transmission line during power oscillation. Finally, a two-source power system and the modified 29-bus system are adopted to verify the CTR calculation and the improved backup protection. Results indicate that the proposed scheme can provide effective evidence of safe operation and relay setting for transmission lines through excavating the tolerance ability of overcurrent and oscillating current.

 In this paper, a transmission line fault location model which is based on an Elman recurrent network (ERN) has been presented for balanced and unbalanced short circuit faults. All fault situations with different inception times are implemented on a 380-kV prototype power system. Wavelet transform (WT) is used for selecting distinctive features about the faulty signals. The system has the advantages of utilizing single-end measurements, using both voltage and current signals. ERN is able to determine the fault location occurred on transmission line rapidly and correctly as an important alternative to standard feedforward back propagation networks (FFNs) and radial basis functions (RBFs) neural networks.
Fault Location Using Wavelet Transform in Combined Transmission Systems
 This paper describes a fault location algorithm in actual combined transmission systems of overhead line with underground power cables. The algorithm to calculate the fault location is developed based on discrete wavelet transform(DWT) and travelling wave theory. The proposed algorithm is using the transient signal data from one end of the transmission line instead of the signals from both ends. In addition, the method to discriminate fault point between overhead line and underground power cable section is also proposed. Various simulations are performed to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using EMTP/ATP and Matlab. The simulation results proved that the proposed method has the excellent ability to discriminate the fault section and to locate the fault in the combined transmission lines
A novel transmission line protection using DOST and SVM
 This paper proposes a smart fault detection, classification and location (SFDCL) methodology for transmission systems with multi-generators using discrete orthogonal Stockwell transform (DOST). The methodology is based on synchronized current measurements from remote telemetry units (RTUs) installed at both ends of the transmission line. The energy coefficients extracted from the transient current signals due to occurrence of different types of faults using DOST are being utilized for real-time fault detection and classification. Support vector machine (SVM) has been deployed for locating the fault distance using the extracted coefficients. A comparative study is performed for establishing the superiority of SVM over other popular computational intelligence methods, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN), for more precise and reliable estimation of fault distance. The results corroborate the effectiveness of the suggested SFDCL algorithm for real-time transmission line fault detection, classification and localization.
Distribution network fault section identification and fault location using wavelet entropy and neural networks
 Fault location in power system distribution networks is especially difficult because of the existence of several laterals/tap-offs in distribution networks. This implies that the calculated fault point can be wrongly estimated to be in any of the laterals. This paper proposes a new hybrid method combining Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and artificial neural network (ANN) for fault section identification (FSI) and fault location (FL) in power system distribution networks. DWT was used in the analysis and extraction of the characteristic features from fault transient signals of the three phase line current measurements obtained at a single substation relaying point, rather than the double-ended approach used in the existing literature. Entropy Per Unit (EPU) indices are afterwards computed from the DWT decomposition, and are used as input to multi-layer ANN models serving as FSI classifiers and FL predictors respectively. The proposed hybrid method is tested using a benchmark IEEE 34-node test feeder. Comparisons, verification, and analysis made using the experimental results obtained from the application of the method showed very good performance for different fault types, fault locations, fault inception angles, and fault resistances. The proposed hybrid method is unique because of the pre-processing stage done with the DWT-EPU indices, the use of only line current measurements from a single relaying point, and the division of the FSI and FL tasks into sub-problems with respective ANN models.

A parametric analysis of variables present in the phenomenon is developed, showing the performance of the method for different line fault types.
Fault diagnosis and fault tolerance control of multilevel sub-module based on HONBM self-inclusion
 The mathematical relation between the sub-module capacitance and the DC system operation characteristics has been analyzed from 4 aspects including the steady energy exchange process of modular multilevel flexible HVDC system, the dynamic response characteristics of active power control, the transient energy exchange process and the bridge arm protection requirement when the DC bipolar short circuit fault. A fault diagnosis and error prevention strategy for the multilevel sub-module system based on the higher order naive Bayes model (HONBM) is proposed. Firstly, analyze the model structure of the multilevel transmission sub-module, and give the Bayes model structure for the fault analysis of the electrical components in the multilevel transmission sub-module model. Then, based on the theoretical analysis results, the selection principle and the calculation method of the modularized multilevel sub-module capacitance are given. The sub-module capacitance is usually calculated according to the requirements of the steady-state sub-module voltage fluctuation and the dynamic response characteristics of the active power control, and then the calibration is made based on the transient sub-module voltage fluctuation and the bridge arm protection requirements.
A single ended directional fault section identifier and fault locator for double circuit transmission lines using combined wavelet and ANN approach
 Fault section identification and determining its location are important aspects to reduce down/repair time, speed up restoration of power supply and to improve the reliability. In this paper combined wavelet and artificial neural network based directional protection scheme is proposed for double circuit transmission lines using single end data to identify the faulty section and its location with reach setting up to 99% of line length. The proposed method requires the three phase currents and voltage to be measured at one end of the double circuit transmission line modelled using distributed parameter line model which also considers the effect of shunt capacitance. Approximate coefficients feature vector of the three phase voltage and current are extracted using discrete wavelet transform to train the ANN with Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The proposed scheme involves two stages. The first stage identifies the zone/section of the fault and the second stage calculates the fault location from the relaying point. The proposed combined Wavelet and ANN based fault location scheme is also compared with ANFIS based fault location scheme. The test results of the proposed scheme show that the fault section identification and location estimation is very accurate and the average percentage error in fault location estimation is within 0.001%. This method is adaptive to the variation of fault type (both forward and reverse), fault inception angle, fault location and fault resistance. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it offers primary protection to 99% of line length using single end data only and also backup protection to the adjacent forward and reverse line sections.
An improved scheme for identifying fault zone in a series compensated transmission line using undecimated wavelet transform and Chebyshev Neural Network
 Identification of fault position with respect to the compensator is an important component for a series compensated transmission line protection scheme. Based on Undecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (UDWT) and Chebyshev Neural Network (ChNN), a new fault zone identification scheme for series compensated transmission line is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique uses only half cycle post fault data samples of three phase currents to identify the fault zone with a two-stage methodology. The performance of the proposed scheme has been compared with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and ChNN based scheme with identical fault cases comprising of all possible ten types of faults under different fault resistances, source impedances, fault inception angles and percentage compensation levels. The result demonstrates that the proposed scheme gives better performance as compared to the other methods proposed in the literature, and the DWT based technique.
An application of global sensitivity analysis in evaluation of transmission line fault-locating algorithms
 Computation of distance to fault on an electrical transmission line is affected by many sources of uncertainty, including parameter setting errors, measurement errors, as well as absence of information and incomplete modelling of a system under fault condition. In this paper we propose an application of the variance-based global sensitivity measures for evaluation of fault location algorithms. The main goal of the evaluation is to identify factors and their interactions that contribute to the fault locator output variability. The sensitivity measures are calculated using the sparse grid integration approach that requires smaller number of samples compared to quasi-Monte Carlo integration. In practice, such analysis can help in: selection of the optimal fault location algorithm (device) for a specific application, calibration process and building confidence in a fault location result. The paper concludes with application examples which demonstrate use of the proposed methodology in testing and comparing some commonly used fault location algorithms.
Application of line surge arresters for voltage uprating and compacting of overhead transmission lines
 This paper discusses the possibility of using line surge arresters (LSAs) for the reduction of switching overvoltages (SOVs) on voltage uprated transmission lines. The method for the selection of LSA energy class and determination of optimum installation locations was proposed. The method was applied in case of improving the overvoltage protection of the transmission line uprated from 220 kV to 400 kV. The possibility of compacting a 400 kV transmission line by installing LSAs was considered. Since a risk of flashover increases due to the reduction of insulation clearances, an algorithm that estimates the risk of flashover was developed and applied in case of compacting a 400 kV transmission line.
An adaptive fault location algorithm for power system networks based on synchrophasor measurements
 This paper presents an adaptive fault location algorithm for power system networks based on synchronized phasor measurements obtained by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). To enhance its accuracy, the proposed algorithm is made to be independent of any data that shall be provided by the electric utility. The proposed algorithm requires three different sets of pre-fault voltage and current phasor measurements at both terminals of the faulty line to be obtained through PMUs. The three sets of local PMU measurements at each terminal are used for online calculation of the respective Thevenin's equivalent (TE). Using the method of multiple measurements with linear regression (MMLR), the three sets of PMU measurements are also employed for online calculation of the transmission line parameters. Online determination of the TEs and line parameters ensures avoiding any possible mismatch with the actual parameters due to system loading and other environmental conditions. The proposed method is applied to a 115 kV system selected from the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) network. The simulation results obtained using PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLABreveal that the proposed algorithm is highly accurate and independent of fault type, fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle and pre-fault loading.
Accurate one-end fault location for overhead transmission lines in interconnected power systems
 This paper presents a new one-end fault location method for overhead transmission lines embedded in a general n-bus interconnected power system. High accuracy in fault location is achieved by using both an accurate distributed parameters model for the faulted transmission line, and a two-bus Thevenin equivalent network model for the power system that accurately accounts for its interconnectivity. The method has been tested using transient fault data obtained from PSCAD/EMTDC simulations of an 11-bus interconnected power system. The results obtained indicate that the method is capable of estimating the fault distance with high accuracy for various fault conditions. They also indicate that method is sensitive to errors in the value of the local bus impedance, but is insensitive to errors in the value of the remote bus impedance.
Online fault detection and the economic analysis of grid-connected photovoltaic systems
 Monitoring system is essential to maintain optimal performance of photovoltaic systems. An automatic fault diagnosis technique in a monitoring system plays critical role in detecting causes affecting the energy production. This paper proposes a new fault detection technique that analyzes the anomalies observed in terminal characteristics of faulty PV strings and corresponding array. The terminal voltage difference between the module in healthy string and the healthy module in unhealthy string can be employed to locate faulty modules. The main advantage of proposed approach is that it voids the need of string current sensors, and reduces the number of voltage sensors using optimal location of voltage sensors. In this technique, power line communication technology based data transmission is used to monitor each PV module. Additionally, a user friendly web application is developed for easy access of monitored data via Internet. Moreover, an economic analysis has also been carried out to study the cost effectiveness of the proposed fault detection technique; considering different values of interest rate and energy tariffs. The profitability of installed grid connected photovoltaic system is determined through its parameters net present value and pay-back period. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed fault detection technique.
Support Vector Machines for classification and locating faults on transmission lines
 This paper presents a new approach to classify fault types and predict the fault location in the high-voltage power transmission lines, by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Wavelet Transform (WT) of the measured one-terminal voltage and current transient signals. Wavelet entropy criterion is applied to wavelet detail coefficients to reduce the size of feature vector before classification and prediction stages. The experiments performed for different kinds of faults occurred on the transmission line have proved very good accuracy of the proposed fault location algorithm. The fault classification error is below 1% for all tested fault conditions. The average error of fault location in a 380 kV–360-km transmission line is below 0.26% and the maximum error did not exceed 0.95 km.
An accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission lines using one-terminal data
 An accurate fault location algorithm for parallel transmission lines, using fundamental frequency components of post-fault voltage and current measured at one terminal, is described in this paper. Parallel transmission lines can be decoupled into the common component net and differential component net. In differential component net, the current distributing coefficient is a function of fault distance, and the differential component current at the fault point can be expressed in terms of the current at the local terminal. Therefore, for asymmetrical faults, the phase fault current can also be expressed as a function of local terminal current and fault distance. With the fault boundary conditions for a given fault type, the fault location equations can then be derived. Based on distributed parameter line model, the proposed algorithm achieves superior locating accuracy, with mutual coupling between circuits, source impedance and fault resistance having very little influence on the locating accuracy. The performance of new algorithm is verified by computer simulation results for transposed and non-transposed lines.
Upgrading transmission line capability by AC–DC conversion
 In recent times, it has been very difficult to build corridors for new overhead lines in industrialized countries like India due to various constraints. To avoid such complicated implementation, building of new infrastructure, new methods are required to upgrade conventional overhead lines. The conversion from AC to DC lines is an alternative way to upgrade the capability of power transmission in order to avoid Rights Of Way (ROW) issues. Hence, in this paper, a methodology is adapted to convert the High Voltage AC (HVAC) line and High Voltage DC (HVDC) for improved power transmission. Electric Field Intensity and Magnetic Field Intensity are evaluated and a real-time data over 400 kV transmission network is analysed to test its performance. The identified network is also analysed under steady and dynamic state with ETAP/PSS/E tool to measure the performance of power transmitted. Further, load flow analysis, short circuit and transient stability are also studied to check the efficacy of the methods adopted to convert HVAC to HVDC lines.
Adaptive algorithm for transmission line protection in the presence of UPFC
 The presence of flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) controllers in transmission lines causes mal-operation of distance relays. The series-shunt FACTS devices have larger influence on the performance of the relays compare to the other FACTS controllers. Furthermore, high-resistance fault is another factor that relay become under-reach and cannot correctly identify the fault. In this paper, a method is provided based on synchrophasors to eliminate the effects of unified power-flow controller (UPFC) and fault resistance on the distance relay. In the presented method, the data of voltage and current signals of buses will be sent to system protection center (SPC). In SPC, an algorithm is provided based on active power calculation in buses which is able to eliminate the effects of both mentioned factors. The main advantage of the proposed method, in addition to the simplicity of the algorithm, is the ability to operate in all types of faults and in high-resistance faults. Furthermore, a technique is presented in this paper to calculate UPFC data. A comparison has been performed between this technique and another method where UPFC data is directly transmitted to SPC by communication channel. In modeling of UPFC, detail model is used based on 48-pulses voltage source converters.
SVM based zonal setting of Mho relay for shunt compensated transmission line
 Presence of shunt FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System) device significantly affect the performance of protection system and may create security and reliability issues. This paper introduces a novel approach for zone identification in transmission line employing shunt FACTS devices such as Static Var Compensator (SVC) and Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The technique depends on the modified apparent impedance seen by the impedance relay for all possible operating conditions. In this technique the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for discriminating faulty zone (zone 1 or zone 2). In addition an optimization technique viz. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize SVM parameters. A typical 230 kV system was simulated in PSCAD/EMTP software and the results show that the proposed scheme is secure, accurate and reliable under the wide variation in power system parameters like load angle, fault resistance, fault location, inception angle and compensation level.
Novel technique for fault location estimation on parallel transmission lines using wavelet
 In this paper, the novel technique for fault location has been investigated on parallel transmission lines using wavelet. Using this technique, we propose two parts for accurate, rapid fault detection and fault location estimation regardless of mutual coupling between parallel lines. The first part is fault detection and extraction of the fundamental signal using wavelet transform. The second part is fault location estimation using least square error method independent of fault resistance, and the remote in feed, etc. The results of extensive simulation showed that it successfully protected the parallel transmission line compared to the traditional techniques more quickly and reliably.
Adaptive design of distance relay for series compensated transmission line
 The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact on the operation of conventional three-stepped distance relaying schemes for protecting the series compensation transmission line and to analysis the effects series compensation on different carrier aided transfer trip scheme under different fault condition. The presence of series compensation in transmission creates over-reaching issues in distance relay due to the net fault impedance of transmission line reduce. Analytical studies of such situation are simulated by using PSCAD and analyzed various responses of distance relays for different fault and system conditions. An enhanced distance protection scheme is implemented to eliminates issues on distance relay for series compensated line. It is also simulated the auto-recloser schemes to discriminating between the temporary and permanent fault.
Non-unit transient based boundary protection for UHV transmission lines
 Different from EHV transmission lines, the boundary of UHV transmission lines naturally consists of busbar stray capacitance, shunt reactor and/or series capacitor. The frequency characteristics of the UHV line boundaries with different structures are analyzed deeply, which have significant attenuation on both high frequency signal and low frequency signal. The attenuation is the inherent characteristic of UHV line boundary. Based on the UHV boundary characteristic, a novel boundary protection principle utilizing backward traveling wave is proposed. The fault direction is identified by means of the time-domain energy of the backward traveling wave. The high frequency energy and the low frequency energy of the backward traveling wave are extracted by wavelet transform, and then the forward internal and external faults are discriminated by the product of high frequency energy and low frequency energy. An adaptive setting calculation method in terms of fault type is presented, which is able to improve effectively the right discriminating rate for internal faults. The simulation model of Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV transmission project is established in ATP/EMTP. The simulation results show that the boundary protection possesses stable performance under various fault situations, and the operation time is less than 2 ms, which is appropriate as the non-unit ultra-high-speed protection element for UHV transmission lines.
Fault location and detection techniques in power distribution systems with distributed generation: A review
 Distribution systems are continuously exposed to fault occurrences due to various reasons, such as lightning strike, failure of power system components due to aging of equipment and human errors. These phenomena affect the system reliability and results in expensive repairs, lost of productivity and power loss to customers. Since fault is unpredictable, a fast fault location and isolation is required to minimize the impact of fault in distribution systems. Therefore, many methods have been developed since the past to locate and detect faults in distribution systems with distributed generation. The methods can be divided into two categories, conventional and artificial intelligence techniques. Conventional techniques include travelling wave method and impedance based method while artificial intelligence techniques include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and matching approach. However, fault location using intelligent methods are challenging since they require training data for processing and are time consuming. In this paper, most of the techniques that have been developed since the past and commonly used to locate and detect faults in distribution systems with distributed generation are reviewed. Research works in fault location area, the working principles, advantages and disadvantages of past works related to each fault location technique are highlighted in this paper. Hence, from this review, the opportunities in fault location research area in power distribution system can be explored further.
A new and accurate fault location algorithm for combined transmission lines using Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System
 This paper presents a new and accurate algorithm for locating faults in a combined overhead transmission line with underground power cable using Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The proposed method uses 10 ANFIS networks and consists of 3 stages, including fault type classification, faulty section detection and exact fault location. In the first part, an ANFIS is used to determine the fault type, applying four inputs, i.e., fundamental component of three phase currents and zero sequence current. Another ANFIS network is used to detect the faulty section, whether the fault is on the overhead line or on the underground cable. Other eight ANFIS networks are utilized to pinpoint the faults (two for each fault type). Four inputs, i.e., the dc component of the current, fundamental frequency of the voltage and current and the angle between them, are used to train the neuro-fuzzy inference systems in order to accurately locate the faults on each part of the combined line. The proposed method is evaluated under different fault conditions such as different fault locations, different fault inception angles and different fault resistances. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method can be used as an efficient means for accurate fault location on the combined transmission lines.
Transient current similarity based protection for wind farm transmission lines
 Large-scale wind farms are usually integrated into the transmission system. Applying traditional steady-state power-frequency based protection strategies in these transmission lines creates challenges such as: (1) the fault current of the wind farm might be dominated by non-power-frequency components caused by the activation of their own protection systems during fault ride through (FRT). The frequency of the dominant component is determined by the rotor speed at the fault inception and might vary from 0.7 to 1.3 times the power frequency. This will create errors in phasors calculated at the power-frequency. (2) The steady-state fault current angles of wind farms are fully controlled by their power converters. The variety of control actions of the different converters during FRT makes these phase angles greatly deviate from those of the synchronous generators. Protection systems that use double-ended phasors such as current differential schemes will suffer from low sensitivity or even malfunction when large-scale wind farms are integrated. Therefore, a novel full-time transient current waveform similarity based protection scheme is proposed to deal with these issues. The full-time current protection scheme uses both the power-frequency and non-power-frequency characteristics and can therefore reduce the influence of power-frequency phasor calculation errors to a minimum. The proposed method uses the transient current (within 10 ms after the fault inception) and is ignores the features of the steady-state fault current. In other words, the proposed protection is suitable for wind farms with a variety of controls. In the proposed method, the correlation coefficient index is used to calculate the similarity of the transient current signals at both ends of the line. Both experimental and field testing results show that using a common sampling frequency, the proposed protection scheme only uses current information and can correctly identify all types of external and internal line faults in a short period of time and can offer better performance for high fault resistance and noise, both for different types of wind farms. All these features and contributions make the new protection feasible for industry application.
Influence of instrument transformers and anti-aliasing filters on the performance of fault locators
 Anti-aliasing filters are used in cascade with instrument transformers (IT) as part of protective relay data acquisition systems for providing input signals to fault locators. Due to IT and anti-aliasing filters transient responses, the fault locators input data may not be replicas of the power network voltage and current waveforms, and incorrect information may be transferred to protection devices. In this paper, the performance of traveling wave-based and impedance-based fault location techniques are evaluated by extensive short-circuit simulations considering different IT topologies and anti-aliasing filters. The total amount of fault location estimated errors were combined to generate an error function and an original study about a thorough statistical analysis was performed. From the obtained results, the errors can be approximated by a function with normal probability distribution, and the fault location performances are directly affected by the fault-induced amplification and attenuation of the highest frequencies at the IT spectrum and the oscillations presented in the anti-aliasing filters bandpass.
Fault diagnosis system for series compensated transmission line based on wavelet transform and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
 This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis approach based on combined wavelet transform and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for fault section identification, classification and location in a series compensated transmission line. It performs an effective feature extraction approach based on norm entropy in order to obtain the features represented main frequency, harmonic and transient characteristics of the fault signals. The proposed method uses the samples of fault voltages and currents for one cycle duration from the inception of fault. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten types of faults using MATLAB/Simulink for a large data set of 23,436 fault cases comprising of all the 10 types of faults. Fault signals varying with fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, load angle, percentage compensation level and source impedance are applied to the proposed algorithm. The results also indicate that the proposed method is robust to wide variation in system conditions and has higher fault diagnosis accuracy with regard to the other approaches in the literature for this problem.

Fault classification technique for series compensated transmission line using support vector machine
 This paper presents a new fault classification technique using support vector machine (SVM) for a series compensated transmission line with a fixed series capacitor placed at the middle of the line. The proposed method uses the samples of one cycle duration of three line currents (IR, IY and IB) and zero sequence current (I0) as features of SVM to accomplish the fault classification task. For each of these four currents (IR, IY, IB and I0), one corresponding SVM has been used. The samples of individual line currents and zero sequence current are fed to individual SVMs which, in turn, identify the involvement of the corresponding phase or ground in the fault. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm has been tested on a 300 km, 400 kV series compensated transmission line through detailed digital simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC for a large data set of 25,200 test cases comprising of all the 10 types of faults with varying fault resistances, different fault inception angles, different fault positions (before and after series capacitor), pre-fault power transfer levels, percentage compensation levels and source impedance values. The results indicate that the proposed technique is fast, accurate and robust for a wide variation in system and fault conditions.
Improved fault analysis technique for protection of Thyristor controlled series compensated transmission line
 Transmission lines are major component of a power system. Any fault on them results in outage of power not only in the area fed by them but also in the neighboring area as well. Therefore, protection of them is very important. Nowadays, in order to allow maximum power transfer series compensation both uncontrolled and controlled are used. Due to the introduction of compensating devices the protection methodology of transmission lines requires changes. A new transmission line fault analysis method based on half cycle post fault three-phase current data has been presented in this paper for series compensated transmission line equipped with Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC). The proposed two-step methodology has been developed with the help of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and implementation of Chebyshev Neural Network (ChNN). ChNN is derived from regular neural network, but is functionally superior. The performance of the developed algorithm has been tested over a vast fault pattern data set dynamically generated with EMTDC/PSCAD. The results with extensive testing indicate effectiveness of the developed scheme with higher level of accuracy and speed. The algorithm is capable of doing classification with minimal training.
Fault Detection in Transmission Lines Using Instantaneous Power with ED Based Fault Index
 In this paper, a new fault detection method is proposed for protection of transmission lines using RMS values of 3-phase instantaneous powers at both sending end and receiving end. The Input signal of any detection algorithm varies not only in case of faults but also other cases like High Impedance faults and different non fault situations like power swings, CT saturation and frequency deviations etc. Several Detection methods were failed particularly in case of high impedance faults and also at other typical cases. The proposed method is verified for normal faults of different types occurring at different instants and also at various locations. The reliability of proposed algorithm is relatively higher when compared to conventional algorithms. It effectively works under high impedance faults also. The method is tested for various case studies using matlab-simulink software.
Research on Optimal Inspection Strategy for Overhead Transmission Line Based on Smart Grid
 Due to the urgent demand for the monitoring of overhead transmission lines in smart grid, this paper proposes an optimal inspection strategy for overhead transmission line considering time-varying failure rate. Based on the goal benefit function of inspection cost, failure electric cost and the maintaining reliability cost, modal of the inspection strategy is established with genetic algorithm. The reliability index could contribute to a dynamic and variable inspection cycle of transmission line via genetic algorithm. According to the calculation results of the middle area of China, it is presented that the algorithm can work out inspection strategy according to the actual failure rate, and get a rational and economical, regional, seasonal, dynamic inspection cycle plan. Thus, it can avoid the traditional over-inspection and lack-inspection problems. The state of transmission line can be guaranteed in more economical way, satisfying the demand of real-time capability and reliability
A novel synchronous fault identification strategy of electronic transformer based on synergy of historical data
 System disturbance caused by line fault, connection or shedding of power source and large load will frequently lead to complicated electromagnetic interference. Subsequently, the abnormal output signal of electronic transformer is likely to be generated due to the deficiency of electromagnetic compatibility, resulting in the maloperation of protection and control system. The aforementioned problems are promising to be solved with the development of substation area protection. In this paper, the existence of the similar region within which the dynamic characteristics of the transmission line fault are of high similarity is proved. Furthermore, the discreteness hypotheses of topology and state of power system are proposed, and the concept of transmission line same-type fault is acquired subsequently. In addition, based on the similarity between a certain dynamic case and the historical case, the principle, criterion as well as implementation to identify the synchronous fault of electronic transformer are proposed, and the evaluation index for describing the fault degree is also given. The feasibility and applied value of the proposed identification strategy are proved based on the simulation model in PSCAD.

The synchronized samples from both ends of the transmission line are the data sources for this scheme. The paper derives a specific feature which equals to zero for normal situation and external faults, and is close to fault current during the internal faults. This feature is used for fault detection and classification. Fault location is then implemented by selecting different methods according to the classified fault type.

Identifying an error source in the differential equation approach for the transmission line fault location algorithm
 An overlooked error source in the differential equation approach for locating a fault on a transmission line is investigated. Due to the use of difference equations in the expansion of the differential equation, a mismatch results between the different transfer functions in the frequency domain that are applied to different terms in the same equation, causing an error in the final fault location estimate. This error source is identified and its effect on the fault location estimate is shown through numerical simulation. A criterion is proposed for improving the difference approximation.

According to the variations characteristics of steady loop closing zero-sequence current, fault section can be determined. Then precise SPG fault position can be got using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology. Even if the fault point cant be located at the first time, the method can still work by repeating the process till the accurate fault position is located. More than 115,200 study cases are simulated on the simulation platform built on PSCAD/EMTP. The results indicate that the proposed fault location method is effective and robust for neutral point non-effectively grounded loop distribution network.
Fault location scheme for combined overhead line with underground power cable
 This paper presents a fault location scheme for transmission systems consisting of an overhead line combined with an underground power cable. The algorithm requires phasor measurements data from one end of the transmission line and the synchronized measurements at the most far end of the power cable. Fault location is derived using distributed line model, modal transformation theory and Discrete Fourier Transform. The technique can be used on-line or off-line using the data stored in the digital fault recording apparatuses. The proposed scheme has the ability to locate the fault whether it is in the overhead line or in the underground power cable. In addition to, the proposed scheme gives an accurate estimation of the fault resistance at fault location. Extensive simulation studies carried out using MATLAB show that the proposed scheme provides a high accuracy in fault location under various fault conditions.
Novel fault location methods for ungrounded radial distribution systems using measurements at substation
 This paper describes novel fault location algorithms for ungrounded radial power distribution systems utilizing voltage and current measurements at substation. Two types of fault location approaches, using line to neutral or line to line measurements, are presented. It's assumed that network structure and parameters are known, so that the during-fault bus impedance matrix of the system can be derived. Then node voltages at substation can be expressed as a product of bus impedance matrix and current injection at substation, from which fault location can be estimated. Evaluation studies based on a 16-bus ungrounded radial distribution system have been performed and it has been demonstrated that accurate fault location estimates can be achieved by both types of methods.
Wide area traveling wave based power grid fault network location method
 Traditional fault traveling wave location schemes, which are based on the fault information of only one line, have lower sensitivity and reliability, especially when one or more traveling wave fault location devices (TWFLD) break down, startup fails or an incorrect arrival time of the initial traveling wave is recorded, this will result in the failure of the fault location. Based on the analysis of the propagation characteristics of the fault traveling wave in power grid, a novel power grid fault traveling wave network location method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the topology of a power grid is analyzed, and the installation principle of TWFLD is presented. Secondly, when the fault occurs on one transmission line, the fault traveling waves travel from the fault point to the whole power grid, and the values of the arrival time of the initial traveling wave is recorded in the substations where the TWFLD are installed. Then the values of the arrival time are analyzed with the information fusion and the fault point is located by using the power grid fault traveling wave network location method. Compared to the existing fault traveling wave location schemes those are based on the fault information of only one line, all correct time information of the whole power grid has been used to calculate the fault distance in this method. Therefore, this method can achieve reliable fault location even when one or more TWFLD break down, startup fails or an incorrect arrival time of the initial traveling wave is recorded. The simulation results match the theoretical analysis well and show that the proposed location method provides not only high accuracy and reliability, but also good economy. These characteristics are beneficial to further enhancement of the practicability of the traveling wave location.
A validated accurate fault location approach by applying noise cancellation technique
 Generally, fault location in underground transmission cable system is very difficult because of many noises. Therefore, a method to remove the noise in power cable systems is proposed by applying noise cancellation technique based on the correlation of multiple scales of the transients using wavelet analysis. After the noise cancellation, the transient signals reflected from fault point and other end of cable can be used to locate the fault using single-ended approach when the single line-to-ground fault occurs in underground transmission cables. This paper proposes a fault location algorithm using noise cancellation technique in noisy environment. This algorithm is simple and straightforward. The simulation results of 225 fault conditions including different fault resistance, fault location and fault inception angle and real test results prove it can accurately locate the fault in very noisy situations when the single line-to-ground fault occurs in the system.
A current independent method based on synchronized voltage measurement for fault location on transmission lines
 This paper presents a new method based on synchronized voltage measurement technique in order to identify the fault locations in two and three-terminal transmission lines. Due to common problems of current transformers in distance protection of power system and as result increasing cost and reduction of protection accuracy, proposed method is independent of current measurement and based on transmission line terminals voltages measurement. Pre-fault and post-fault voltages at both ends of the line are measured synchronously and used to calculate the fault location. Proposed method calculates the fault location using Thevenin model of faulted system and transforms the whole parameters to symmetric components. Using proposed technique, fault location can be calculated with a lower than 0.6% error without using current transformers. EMTP/ATP simulation results and mathematical analysis show that proposed fault location technique is independent of fault type, fault resistance, fault inception angle and loading angle of the transmission line.
Robust transmission line fault classification using wavelet multi-resolution analysis
 With the advent of high speed communication technology, global positioning system (GPS) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, there has been a paradigm shift in the parlance of power grid operation and control. The power system is in a phase of transition towards smart grid with the aid of these techniques to combat against contingencies, leading to reduction of failures and blackouts. The transmission lines are considered to be the back bone of the grid and traverse over difficult terrains. With the advancements in digital relaying and wide-area protection along with GPS technology, philosophy of protection has also undergone a paradigm change to take care of such challenges. This paper explores the possibility of transmission line protection for multi-generator system using wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) technique along with GPS. The inputs for the wavelet transform are the synchronized currents measured by remote telemetry units (RTUs) in conjunction with GPS technology at different buses. The classification algorithm uses wavelet MRA technique to extract features of the transient current signals based on harmonics generated due to abrupt change of currents in a three-phase transmission line caused by different faults. The major contribution of this paper is that the classification algorithm is immune to the effects of fault inception angle, fault impedance, fault distance and power angle. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for real time smart grid operation.
Ruptures in overhead ground wire — Transmission line 220 kV
 The broken strand of overhead ground wire (OGW), which is mainly caused by lightning strikes or the vibration of OGW, can lead to serious damage to the power grid system. Power-line maintenance work is generally carried out by specialized workers under extra-high voltage live-line conditions which involve great risks and high labor intensity. If the OGW or OPGW are broken and they fall, this may cause a short-circuit fault of the power transmission lines. Besides this fault, in the event of OPGW breakage, communication interruption will also occur, causing significant damage to the communication system of the electric power utility and the public. Therefore, the melting and breaking characteristics of OGW strands must be clarified. In this research, a case study of a double simultaneous rupture in an OGW, it is analyzed in the Section 3, these simultaneous failures caused by lightning strikes were developed. The effects on the mechanical capacity and structural damaged is analyzed in the Section 4, a discussion has been considered in the Section 5. The calculation way will be also a good tool for developing a new OGW strand that is hard to melt and is broken by high-energy lightning strikes.
Fault location on multi-terminal DC systems using synchronized current measurements
 Multi-terminal dc transmission systems are suitable substitutes for their ac counterparts, once the associated costs are justified. This paper proposes a new traveling wave-based fault location method for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) systems. In doing so, the fault section and its included lines are specified using a straightforward algorithm. Then, an evaluation index is developed to determine the faulted line amongst all included ones in the fault section. Finally, a system of linear equations taking into account the fault inception time, the fault location and the first arrival times at different detector locations are constructed and solved. The method merely needs the first current surge arrival times, thus eliminating the practical difficulties in relation with identifying other traveling wave features. Besides, the fault is easily located despite the complexity of the network topology, i.e., the number of its meshes and radial lines. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, a large number of simulation studies are conducted on a complicated MTDC system. Obtained results verify the high accuracy, noise immunity and fault impedance robustness of the proposed method.
Wavelet and neuro-fuzzy based fault location for combined transmission systems
 This paper describes the fault location algorithm using neuro-fuzzy systems in combined transmission lines with underground power cables. The neuro-fuzzy system consists of two parts to perform different tasks. One is to discriminate the fault section between overhead and underground using the detailed coefficients obtained by wavelet transform. The other system calculates fault location. The algorithm for fault location again is divided into two parts: one to calculate the fault location on the overhead lines, the other one for the underground cable section. This system shows excellent results for discrimination of fault section and calculation of fault location.
A transient current based double line transmission system protection using fuzzy-wavelet approach in the presence of UPFC
 This paper presents a wavelet fuzzy based protection scheme for a double line transmission system with unified power flow controller. The protection scheme makes use of current signals at both the ends of transmission line which are synchronized with the help of global position system clock. A wavelet based multiresolution analysis is used to find the detailed coefficients of these signals which are utilized to calculate fault index. These fault indexes are compared with a threshold value to detect and classify faults on transmission system. The approximate decomposition of the current signals is utilized to locate the fault using Fuzzy logic from their respective terminals. The proposed algorithm has been tested successfully for various faults at different locations.
Fault location in underground cables using ANFIS nets and discrete wavelet transform
 This paper presents an accurate algorithm for locating faults in a medium voltage underground power cable using a combination of Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed method uses five ANFIS networks and consists of 2 stages, including fault type classification and exact fault location. In the first part, an ANFIS is used to determine the fault type, applying four inputs, i.e., the maximum detailed energy of three phase and zero sequence currents. Other four ANFIS networks are utilized to pinpoint the faults (one for each fault type). Four inputs, i.e., the maximum detailed energy of three phase and zero sequence currents, are used to train the neuro-fuzzy inference systems in order to accurately locate the faults on the cable. The proposed method is evaluated under different fault conditions such as different fault locations, different fault inception angles and different fault resistances.
Robust functional analysis for fault detection in power transmission lines
 Fault detection methods in power transmission lines aim to detect deviations of the electrical signals from the expected behavior of such signals under normal operating conditions. One approach is to model, as accurately as possible, the expected behavior of the electrical signals under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, even under normal conditions, electrical signals are subject to random noises. Therefore, upper and lower limits must be established. The larger the limits, the harder the fault detection. On the contrary, the narrower the limits the more likely to detect false faults. Functional analysis of power transmission lines was originally proposed to represent the behavior of the electrical signals and to estimate the upper and lower limits under normal operating conditions. Nonetheless, the originally proposed estimates are biased and rely on statistical assumptions that do not hold in practice. This work proposes new methods to estimate the parameters of the functional model and new upper and lower limits that do not rely on specific statistical assumptions. Simulated and real case results show that the proposed robust functional analysis reduces bias and provides more accurate false fault detection rates, as compared to the previous method.
Synchronized measurement based an adaptive distance relaying scheme for STATCOM compensated transmission line
 Protection of bulk power delivering transmission line (TL) is very important for power system stability and reliability. The environmental and right of way restrictions delayed the construction of new transmission line to meet the deregulated power demands. Shunt FACTS devices connected in the transmission system enhances the power transfer capability up to its thermal limit. Shunt FACTS devices have the ability to control series impedance, shunt impedance, current, voltage and load angle. STATCOM is one of such shunt FACTS devices which severely affect the protection system installed for TL. This research work is focused on the addressing the issues with distance relaying of STATCOM compensated TL and to overcome these adverse effects, new adaptive relaying algorithm is presented based on synchronized measurement. The proposed algorithm is implemented in PSCAD EMTDC simulation to validate its performance in terms of accuracy and reliability subjected to various faults on TL. Error in the fault location estimation with proposed algorithm is 0.6% for 300 km TL. To claim the superiority and its accuracy, the algorithm is tested in hardware environment with faults in offline mode.
A fast time–frequency transform based differential relaying scheme for UPFC based double-circuit transmission line
 This paper presents a new differential relaying scheme for a mutually coupled, double circuit transmission line in presence of Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) in the line. The process starts at retrieving the three phase current signals at both ends of the transmission line synchronously and processing it though the time–frequency transform such as Fast Discrete S-Transform to derive the spectral energy content of the current signals. The differential spectral energy of current signals (difference between the spectral energy of the current signal at the sending and receiving ends, respectively) of the respective phases of transmission line is used to register the fault pattern. The proposed approach includes fault detection and classification along with identification of the fault section with respect to UPFC location in one of the double-circuit transmission line. The extensive test results indicate that the proposed differential relaying scheme is highly reliable in registering fault patterns in UPFC based transmission line including wide variations in operating parameters of the power network.
Using instantaneous values for estimating fault locations on series compensated transmission lines
 Fault location estimation hitherto is based on using the filtered rms values from both ends of the line. In this paper, a new method for locating faults on series compensated high voltage transmission lines, based on the instantaneous values is proposed. Based on the results achieved with the algorithm previously published, using instantaneous values, the distance to fault location is estimated very accurately. However, the accuracy of the fault location is limited to the ability to capture data samples before the operation of the metal oxide varistor (MOV). The proposed algorithm incorporates special techniques to avoid the limitation caused by the operation of MOV. It is formal that although the accuracy of fault location using the algorithm proposed is slightly reduced, but still acceptable. This paper describes the new algorithm and examines its accuracy as compared to the paper previously published by these authors.
Fault location observability analysis and optimal meter placement based on voltage measurements
 Various transmission line fault location algorithms have been proposed in the past depending on measurements available. These methods evince that if a sufficient number of meters are placed in a power network to record the fault measurements, then the fault location can be reliably estimated. A relevant question to ask may be: how many meters are sufficient in order to derive a reliable and unique fault location estimate for a given network? This paper addresses this question by defining and performing the fault location observability analysis. An optimal meter placement scheme is proposed for determining the optimal locations to place meters so as to make the system observable while minimizing the required number of meters to reduce costs. The proposed method is especially useful for power networks where digital relays have not yet been widely adopted and measuring devices such as digital fault recorders are deployed for monitoring purposes. A sample power network has been employed to illustrate the proposed method.
Analysis of power system faults in EHVAC line for varying fault time instances using wavelet transforms
 This paper evaluates how the occurrence time of fault affects the energy entropy present in a fault signal. The diagnostic method that is proposed is based on calculating the wavelet entropy of sampled signal at different fault occurrence times. The energy of detailed coefficients of db wavelet are extracted at level 1 & level 5 for L–G fault and analysis is done for varying fault times. The analysis can further be extended to other types of faults.
Fault location in power networks with mixed feeders using the complex space-phasor and Hilbert–Huang transform
 The paper introduces a practical approach to power system fault location in power networks using advanced fault signal processing. The three-phase fault voltages are converted to the vector of absolute values of its complex space-phasor. This vector represents fault traveling wave and it is further processed for fault location finding with the Hilbert–Huang transform. The simulation results, including single line to ground faults, faults in mixed feeders and high-impedance arcing faults, confirm the accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed approach.
Online fault diagnosis for nonlinear power systems
 This paper considers the problem of automatic fault diagnosis for transmission lines in large scale power networks. Since faults in transmission lines threatens stability of the entire power network, fast and reliable fault diagnosis is an important problem in transmission line protection. This work is the first paper exploiting sparse signal recovery for the fault-diagnosis problem in power networks with nonlinear swing-type dynamics. It presents a novel and scalable technique to detect, isolate and identify transmission faults using a relatively small number of observations by exploiting the sparse nature of the faults. Buses in power networks are typically described by second-order nonlinear swing equations. Based on this description, the problem of fault diagnosis for transmission lines is formulated as a compressive sensing or sparse signal recovery problem, which is then solved using a sparse Bayesian formulation. An iterative reweighted ℓ1-minimisation algorithm based on the sparse Bayesian learning update is then derived to solve the fault diagnosis problem efficiently. With the proposed framework, a real-time fault monitoring scheme can be built using only measurements of phase angles at the buses.
Fault Locating in Transmission Networks Using Transient Voltage Data
 Generally, short circuit faults are the most important disturbances in power transmission lines. Accurate and fast finding of fault location, are the main characteristics of a proper fault locating system during transient and stable faults. In this paper, after a short review on current methods and techniques in the field of fault locating in transmission networks, a new method has been introduced using the data obtained from single terminal transient input voltage. The Wavelet Transform is used for identification of the transient wave receiving time in associated terminals. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on a standard network against various fault types, different fault resistances, and for several fault initial angles, using MATLAB simulation tools. The obtained results showed proper accuracy and correctness of the proposed technique.
An architecture for online-diagnosis systems supporting compressed communication
 With its ability to detect, identify and, if applicable, recover from occurred faults, online-diagnosis can help achieving fault-tolerant systems. A sound decision on an occurred fault is the foundation for fault-specific recovery actions. For this, typically a large amount of data has to be analyzed and evaluated. A diagnostic process implemented on a distributed system needs to communicate all those data among the network which is an expensive affair in terms of communication resources and time. In this paper we present an architecture for a distributed online-diagnosis system with real time constraints that supports data compression to reduce the communication time. We further present a library of lossy compression methods with guaranteed compression ratios that are suitable for real time purposes.
Laplace-based computation of transient profiles along transmission lines including time-varying and non-linear elements
 In this paper, a combination of a transmission line model defined in the q-s domain (spatial frequency-temporal frequency), the two-dimensional Laplace transform and the principle of superposition is applied to compute transient voltage and current profiles along transmission systems including time-dependent and non-linear elements. The detailed internal information provided by these profiles can be very useful in applications such as insulation coordination design, fault detection and location. The method presented in this paper has significant advantages over the computation of transient profiles using EMTP-type software, given that the latter requires the subdivision of the line, which is time consuming and prone to numerical error accumulation. Additionally, since the line model is defined in the frequency domain, it is possible to include the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters in a very straightforward manner. In order to evidence the accuracy and versatility of the proposed method, several applications examples are presented, and the computed results are compared with those obtained using ATP.
Transmission line relay mis-operation detection based on time-synchronized field data
 In this paper, a real-time tool to detect transmission line relay mis-operation is implemented. The tool uses time-synchronized measurements obtained from both ends of the line during disturbances. The proposed fault analysis tool comes into the picture only after the protective device has operated and tripped the line. The proposed methodology is able not only to detect, classify, and locate transmission line faults, but also to accurately confirm whether the line was tripped due to a mis-operation of protective relays. The analysis report includes either detailed description of the fault type and location or detection of relay mis-operation. As such, it can be a source of very useful information to support the system restoration. The focus of the paper is on the implementation requirements that allow practical application of the methodology, which is illustrated using the field data obtained the real power system. Testing and validation is done using the field data recorded by digital fault recorders and protective relays. The test data included several hundreds of event records corresponding to both relay mis-operations and actual faults. The discussion of results addresses various challenges encountered during the implementation and validation of the presented methodology.
Assessment of impedance based fault locator for AC micro-grid
 This paper proposes an impedance-based fault location determination scheme for the 3-phase micro-grid. The paper describes how voltage and current data during a fault event can be leveraged to accurately locate a fault in the micro-grid including distributed generation (DG). The proposed method uses voltage and current measurements from both ends of the line section in order to determine the fault location. This method is devised in such a way that it evades the requirement of fault type identification by using only one fault location equation. The method is applicable to all types of shunt faults. In the proposed formulation of fault location, the effect of mutual inductance and capacitance of distribution line is also considered. The method is tested on a simulated medium-voltage (MV) micro-grid with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines connected to specific nodes. The test results indicate that the proposed fault locator can reliably locate faults in the micro-grid with high accuracy.
A WAMS/PMU-based fault location technique
 A WAMS (wide-area measurement/monitoring system)/PMU (phasor measurement unit)-based fault location technique is proposed in this paper. The technique uses synchronized fault voltages of two nodes of the faulted line and their neighboring nodes for fault location. Based on these fault node voltages measured by PMUs, line currents between these nodes can be calculated. Then, node injection currents at two terminals of the faulted line are formed from the line currents. Based on the calculated fault node injection currents, fault node can be deduced or fault location in transmission lines can be calculated accurately. Fault location formulas are derived in full details. Case studies on IEEE-14-bus system and a testing network with 500 kV transmission lines including ATP/EMTP simulations are given to validate the proposed technique. Various fault types and fault resistances are also considered.
Fault Line Selection Method Considering Grounding Fault Angle for Distribution Network
 In the distribution network system with its neutral point grounding via arc suppression coil, when single-phase grounding fault occurred near zero-crossing point of the phase voltage, the inaccuracy of the line selection always existed in existing methods. According to the characteristics that transient current was different between the fault feeder and other faultless feeders, wavelet transformation was performed on data of the transient current within a power frequency cycle after the fault occurred. Based on different fault angles, wavelet energy in corresponding frequency band was chosen to compare. The result was that wavelet energy in fault feeder was the largest of all, and it was larger than sum of those in other faultless feeders, when the bus broke down, the disparity between each wavelet energy was not significant. Fault line could be selected out by the criterion above. The results of MATLAB/simulink simulation experiment indicated that this method had anti-interference capacity and was feasible.
Protection of series compensated transmission line: Issues and state of art
 In the present-day scenario, per-capita power consumption symbolizes the development of any society. This has resulted in a multifold increase in power demand. This drives power engineers to generate and transfer maximum possible power through transmission line, i.e. up to thermal limits, which leads toward installation of compensating devices. However, this inclusion of compensation introduces changes in system parameters, i.e. in its impedance seen from relay point, voltage and current inversion, introduction of sub-harmonic frequency components, etc. This requires changes in existing protection concepts. Therefore, there is a need to track all experiences, developments and research in the field of protection of series compensated transmission line and look for the gaps in it. This paper gives bibliographical survey and general backgrounds of research and development in the field of series compensated lines (fixed capacitor and TCSC) since the application of series compensation. This article also compares and evaluates different techniques with their relative advantages and disadvantages to lead toward optimum technique for application. More emphasis is given to modern techniques. The literature is divided into parts to reduce the difficulty for new researchers to evaluate different techniques with a set of references of all concerned contributions.
Directional relaying using support vector machine for double circuit transmission lines including cross-country and inter-circuit faults
 The conventional distance relaying algorithms are unable to detect the inter-circuit faults, cross-country faults, high resistance faults which may occur in a double circuit line. This paper presents combined Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based directional relaying and fault classification scheme including inter-circuit faults, cross-country faults and high resistance faults. SVM modules are designed for forward or reverse fault identification and fault classification using single terminal data. The 3rd level approximate discrete wavelet transform coefficients of three phase current signals only have been used. Proposed method is tested with variations in fault type, fault location, fault inception angle, fault resistance, inter-circuit faults, and cross-country faults. The proposed method based on SVM does not need any threshold to operate which is an exceptional attribute for a protective function. As SVMs are not based on comparing with some threshold, rather initially the SVMs are trained with the wide variety of fault patterns which is an offline process and then the trained SVMs are tested online to detect and classify the fault within short time. The test results show that all types of shunt faults can be identified within half cycle time. The proposed scheme offers both primary protection to 95% of the line section and also backup protection to 95% of the adjacent reverse and forward line section also.
A non-unit protection scheme for double circuit series capacitor compensated transmission lines
 This paper presents a non-unit protection scheme for series capacitor compensated transmission lines (SCCTL) using discrete wavelet transform and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. All the protective relaying functions such as fault detection, fault classification, faulty phase identification and fault location estimation have been considered in this work. Such a comprehensive work providing all protective relaying functions for protection of double circuit SCCTL utilizing k-NN has not been reported so far. The signal processing and feature extraction are done using discrete wavelet transform due to its capability to differentiate between high and low frequency transient components. For fault detection and classification, only approximate wavelet coefficient of current signal up to level 1 has been used; while for k-NN location estimation, both voltage and current signals of the two circuits are decomposed up to level 3 have been used. Finally, the standard deviation of one cycle pre-fault and one cycle post-fault samples of the approximate wavelet coefficients are calculated to form the feature vector for the k-NN-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated for large number of fault events with variation in fault type including inter-circuit faults, fault inception angle, fault location and fault resistance. The change in position of series capacitor and different degree of compensation has been discussed. The accuracy of the proposed k-NN-based fault detection and classification module is 100% for all the tested fault cases with a decision period of less than half cycle. The k-NN-based fault location scheme estimates the location of fault with ≤1% error for most of the tested fault cases, which is an exceptional attribute of the proposed scheme as compared with 10–15% error of conventional distance relaying scheme.
An adaptive single-pole automatic reclosing method for uncompensated high-voltage transmission lines
 This paper proposes an adaptive single-pole reclosing method for uncompensated high-voltage transmission lines. This method is based on the dependence of the fundamental-frequency line-side voltage of the faulted phase on the equivalent fault path resistance representing the arc state and the healthy phase power flow. The moment of stabilisation of the post-arc regime is determined by the absolute value of the real part and the rate of change of the real and imaginary parts of this voltage, ensuring restoration of sufficient insulation strength. The setting is adapted on the basis of interconnected models used for online estimation of the pre-fault regime, fault distance estimation, calculation of the double line interruption regime of the whole network with symmetrical components to estimate infeed for the detailed line model and threshold voltage determination by line model output. The dynamic MATLAB SimPowerSystems simulations under different load flow and arc conditions demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method.
Performance evaluation of traction and utility network interface: Fault location and protection coordination
 Single phase AC traction systems pose unique challenges to power utilities at interface points of connection on the power delivery network. Traction systems are usually supplied from dedicated utility networks in order to minimise the negative effects that traction loads have on conventional three phase loads, particularly in instances where customer equipment may be sensitive to the quality of supply. The electric utility’s power network is exposed to faults, short duration thermal overloads, temporary over-voltages, high magnitude transient recovery voltages, load unbalance and harmonics which emanate from the traction system. This research investigation evaluates and analyses Eskom’s network and Transnet Freight Rail’s network and presents a methodology for determining fault location and effective discrimination between electric utility and traction network faults. This is essential where there is a lack of protection coordination or difficulty in achieving coordination between the protective devices in each system. The method is further developed into a protection coordination philosophy to ensure that the utility’s protection relays operate for utility network faults only, while the traction system relays operate for faults within the traction networks. The balance of this paper assesses the withstand capability of network equipment against temporary overvoltage caused by single phasing on the utility system; a performance evaluation of high magnitude transient recovery voltage following network faults, and determination of the minimum technical specification of equipment on the system. Results obtained and proposed solutions to minimise the levels of overvoltage for both the temporary and transient cases are presented and discussed.
A rough membership neural network approach for fault classification in transmission lines
 Objective: This paper presents a new approach for fault classification in extra high voltage (EHV) transmission line using a rough membership neural network (RMNN) classifier. Methods: Wavelet transform is used for the decomposition of measured current signals and for extraction of ten significant time–frequency domain features (TFDF), as well as three distinctive time domain features (TDF) particularly in terms of getting better classification performance. After extracting useful features from the measured signals, a decision of fault type of a transmission line is carried out using ten RMNN classifiers. Furthermore, to reduce the training times of the neural network, the rough neurons are used as input layer neurons, and the fuzzy neurons are utilized in hidden and output layer in each RMNN. And the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is employed for determining the optimal connection weights between neurons of the different layers in the RMNN. Results and Conclusions: To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, extensive simulations have been carried out under different fault conditions with wide variations in fault type, fault resistance, fault location and fault inception angle. Simulations results show that the proposed scheme is faster and more accurate than the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and it is proved to be a robust classifier for digital protection.
A fault location method for parallel transmission lines
 This paper presents a fault location method for one of two individually transposed parallel transmission lines. This method only utilizes voltage and current data acquired at one common end of the two lines to estimate the equivalent source impedance at the remote end. Therefore, the current through a fault resistance in the fault-path can be computed and the effects of the fault resistance and source impedance of the remote system on the accuracy of fault location can be eliminated. However, this method requires that: (1) a fault occurs only on one of the two parallel lines; and (2) the unfaulted line remains in operation until the fault is cleared.
Fault location using synchronized sequence measurements
 This paper proposes fault location formulas using synchronized sequence measurements. For earth faults, zero-sequence voltages and currents at two terminals of faulted line are applied to fault location. Negative-sequence measurements are utilized for asymmetrical faults and positive-sequence measurements are used for three-phase faults. The fault location formulas are derived from a fault location technique [Wang C, Dou C, Li X, Jia Q. A WAMS/PMU-based fault location technique. Elect Power Syst Res 2007;77(8):936–945.] based on WAMS/PMU. The technique uses synchronized fault voltages measured by PMUs in power network. The formulas are simple and are easy for application. Case studies on a testing network with 500 kV transmission lines including ATP/EMTP simulations are presented. Various fault types and fault resistances are also considered.

 In this paper a new numerical algorithm for fault distance calculation and arcing fault recognition, based on one terminal data and derived in the time domain, is presented. The algorithm is derived for the case of most frequent single-phase line to ground fault. The faulted phase voltage is modelled as a serial connection of the fault resistance and the arc voltage. The fault distance and the arc voltage amplitude are estimated using Least Error Squares Technique. The algorithm can be applied for distance protection, intelligent autoreclosure and for fault location. The results of algorithm testing through computer simulation and an example of real life data processing are given.
A general fault location method in complex power grid based on wide-area traveling wave data acquisition
 With the development of wide-area measurement technology, it is possible to obtain the fault-originated traveling wave synchronously in a complex power grid. Based on the specialized deployment of the monitoring points and arrival time of initial traveling wave-front acquired by phase-mode transformation and wavelet transformation, this paper proposes a general method for fault-location in complex power grid. Manhattan distance is adopted to find out the accurate measuring combinations, by which the preliminary fault location is calculated. Then the accuracy and robustness of the results can be improved by the fault-occurrence time which is calculated by the information of monitoring points and grid topology relationship. All simulations are carried out in PSCAD and the IEEE 30-bus system is built in order to obtain the synchronization fault signals. The simulation result proves that the proposed method has high accuracy. The uncertainty of the measurement errors is also included in the simulation and shows that the algorithm has high robustness.
An accurate fault location algorithm for transmission line based on R–L model parameter identification
 An accurate time domain algorithm for fault location using one-terminal data is presented. The algorithm is based on the modal analysis and the R–L model of transmission lines, and utilizes the fault-superimposed components effectively. In the algorithm, the differential equations of fault condition networks and pure-fault networks are combined to determine the fault distance. The fault distance, fault resistance and source parameters at the remote end are solved as the unknown variables of a second-order system by finite difference method. This algorithm eliminates influence of the fault resistance and the opposite source parameters on the fault location accuracy, which have been the main source of error for conventional one-terminal approaches. In addition, the paper discusses manipulations of equations to solvable form and the minimum number of equations required. By the analysis to the correlation of measurement equations and the analytic solution of the fault current and voltage in time domain, the paper demonstrates that one-terminal algorithm has the same precision as two-terminal algorithm in theory. The EMTP simulation results show the validity and high accuracy of the new algorithm.
Bearing fault detection and fault size estimation using fiber-optic sensors
 Health monitoring of rotating machinery is commonly based on vibration signals. Instead, this pioneering research provides bearing diagnostics using strain measurements, obtained from Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) fiber-optic sensors. Besides detection of the damage via spectral data, these optical sensors also allow the estimation of damage severity through the direct and accurate measurement of the damage size of small spalls in the bearing races, an essential capability for the prognosis of remaining useful life. FBG sensors are small and can be easily placed in the immediate proximity of the bearing or even embedded inside it, thereby ensuring much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio through the minimizing transmission path effects from remote disturbances. These ball-bearing related diagnostic capabilities of FBG sensors are demonstrated via seeded tests, as well as by means of extended monitoring of bearings during fatigue endurance tests. Sensitivity to FBG sensor location is studied, showing acceptable values at all housing measuring points around the bearing. Fiber-optic sensors appear to have promising diagnostic potential for spall-like faults in both the outer and inner races of ball bearings with a very good discrimination power.
Fast isolation of faults in transmission systems using current transients
 This paper presents a protection scheme that is capable of very fast isolation of faults in high voltage transmission systems. Proposed scheme comprises set of relays connected through a telecommunication network, located at different nodes of the system. Relays use wavelet coefficients of current signals to identify the fault directions relative to their location. Fault directions identified at different locations in the system can be combined to determine the faulted line (or busbar) and isolate it. A robust single ended traveling wave based fault distance estimation approach is proposed as a backup in case of communication failure. Investigations were carried out using time domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC for a high voltage transmission system.

A large number of data are collected from industrial site and analyzed, proposed algorithm is verified to be effective and exact.
Automated double-ended traveling wave record correlation for transmission line disturbance analysis
 Automating analysis and correlation of traveling wave data of the same fault event from two terminals of a transmission line is essential for automated double-ended traveling wave based fault location and disturbance analysis. This paper presents a traveling wave data detection and correlation matching method. This method is capable of detecting disturbance events on transmission lines obtained at different terminals based on synchronized data. The traveling waves caused by the same disturbance tend to be captured by multiple recording devices at different observation points, resulting in a significant change in only a few channels for each captured record. The waveform pixel ratio and the featured line of waveforms are extracted based on the possible disturbances that can be identified and recorded at a local database. The correlated searching and feature matching is executed for the remote record database. The correlated traveling wave data for disturbance events can be acquired and then used for locating the event and further analysis. The proposed method is able to extract the effective traveling wave segment corresponding to the same disturbance event from the database at different observation points. This facilitates the automated double-end location. Test results based on field data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Time-domain fault location algorithm for parallel transmission lines using unsynchronized currents
 Parallel transmission lines under fault can be decoupled into common component net and differential component net. For the differential component net is only composed by parallel lines part and its bus voltages are zero, the voltage distributions along differential component net can be calculated by each terminal current. The novel time-domain fault location algorithm is founded by voltage distributions from both terminals have the least difference at the fault point. The synchronization is achieved by searching the minimal value of locating criterion function, which is calculated by fixing one terminal data and moving another terminal data within a setting time. The proposed algorithm needs a very short data-window, any segment of fault data from transient to steady state can be used to locate faults, and no voltage data is needed. With distributed parameter model, simulations show that the locating errors are less than 0.1 km, and the fault types and fault resistances have no effect on locating accuracy.
Building a fault tolerant framework with deadline guarantee in big data stream computing environments
 Big data stream computing systems should work continuously to process streams of on-line data. Therefore, fault tolerance is one of the key metrics of quality of service in big data stream computing. In this paper, we propose a fault tolerant framework with deadline guarantee for stream computing called FTDG. First, FTDG identifies the critical path of a data stream graph at a given data stream throughput, and quantifies the system reliability of a data stream graph. Second, FTDG allocates tasks by the fault tolerance aware heuristic and critical path scheduling mechanism. Third, FTDG online optimizes the task scheduling by reallocating the critical vertices on the critical path of the data stream graph to lower the response time and reduce system fluctuations. Theoretical as well as experimental results demonstrate that the FTDG makes a desirable trade-off between high fault tolerance and low response time objectives in big data stream computing environments.
Application of extreme learning machine for series compensated transmission line protection
 This paper proposes a new approach based on combined Wavelet Transform-Extreme Learning Machine (WT-ELM) technique for fault section identification (whether the fault is before or after the series capacitor as observed from the relay point), classification and location in a series compensated transmission line. This method uses the samples of fault currents for half cycle duration from the inception of fault. The features of fault currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the extracted features are applied as inputs to ELMs for fault section identification, classification and location. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten types of faults using MATLAB simulink. On testing 28,800 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, load angle, percentage compensation level and source impedance, the performance of the proposed method has been found to be quite promising. The results also indicate that the proposed method is robust to wide variation in system and operating conditions.
Phasor measurement unit based transmission line protection scheme design
 This paper presents an adaptive transmission line protection scheme based on synchronized phasor measurement units. This scheme uses the positive-sequence voltage and current phasors at both ends of a transmission line to determine the parameter of the transmission line and the location of a fault on the transmission line. This scheme can be used for the protection of both single- and double-circuit transmission lines. This scheme is also robust against power swing conditions. A novel adaptive single pole auto re-closer is introduced based on the proposed scheme due to its capability of differentiating transient and permanent faults. System simulation studies show that the proposed scheme is able to operate fast and accurately for transmission line protection.
Novel WRM-based architecture of hybrid PON featuring online access and full-fiber-fault protection for smart grid
 In this paper, a novel architecture of hybrid PON for smart grid is proposed by introducing a wavelength-routing module (WRM). By using conventional optical passive components, a WRM with M ports is designed. The symmetry and passivity of the WRM makes it be easily integrated and very cheap in practice. Via the WRM, two types of network based on different ONU-interconnected manner can realize online access. Depending on optical switches and interconnecting fibers, full-fiber-fault protection and dynamic bandwidth allocation are realized in these networks. With the help of amplitude modulation, DPSK modulation and RSOA technology, wavelength triple-reuse is achieved. By means of injecting signals into left and right branches in access ring simultaneously, the transmission delay is decreased. Finally, the performance analysis and simulation of the network verifies the feasibility of the proposed architecture.
An innovative finite state automata based approach for fault direction estimation in transmission lines
 In this work finite state automata or finite state machine based directional protection scheme is proposed for transmission lines. Phase angle of positive sequence current is used as input to finite state automata based fault direction estimation module. Finite state automata is used as fault pattern recognizer which estimates the direction of fault. The output of the proposed FSM based scheme will be ‘−1’ for reverse section faults and ‘1’ for fault in primary section faults. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated using data simulated for variation of fault type, fault inception angle, fault location, power flow angle, reverse power flow and fault resistance. Accuracy of the method is found to be 100% from all 11,500 fault cases. Proposed technique does not use voltage unlike conventional directional relaying schemes due to which there is no issue regarding close-in fault detection. The reach setting of the proposed method is up to 99.9% of line length which has advantage over conventional relaying schemes which have reach up to 80–85% of line. Although proposed method is a pattern recognition based technique, it does require an extra training module unlike artificial neural network to estimate the direction correctly. The proposed technique is effective because it do not require any training and the computation complexity is very less as compared to training based algorithms. Proposed method is also tested in an existing power system network of India, which shows accurate result in estimating fault direction.
Parameterless earth fault locator algorithm based on transient surges resulting from single-pole breaker opening
 This paper proposes a novel concept for ground faults locating on the basis of the traveling waves principles for EHV transmission systems. The transient surges generated due to single-pole breaker opening are localized in order to determine the accurate fault distance on the basis of single-end measurements. The proposed fault location concept is independent of the propagation speed. Also, the proposed strategy of creating traveling surges is exploited with synchronized double-end measurements. Time extraction of traveling surges is performed using the second derivative of the aerial mode voltage after breaker pole opening. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using transmission systems of multiple terminals. The results provide evidence the efficacy of the proposed fault location mechanism.
Protection of parallel transmission lines including inter-circuit faults using Naïve Bayes classifier
 Parallel transmission lines are difficult to protect due to mutual coupling between circuits. This paper proposes a Naïve Bayes classifier (NBC) based fault detection and classification technique for protection of parallel transmission line involving inter-circuit faults. NBC is a good classification tool for larger data sets as the training process takes less time with greater accuracy. Input given to the fault detection module is the fundamental components of three phase current signals of both circuits. Input given to the fault phase identification and fault classification module is the fundamental component of three phase current signals and zero sequence currents of both the circuits. Seven separate classifiers are designed for fault phase identification for A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2 and G. From fault phase identification module faults are classified. Accuracy of the proposed method is 100% for fault detection and 99.99% for classification of fault from all the tested fault cases. Response time of the proposed method is within 10 ms for all the fault cases studied.
Optimal location and minimum number of superconducting fault current limiters for the protection of power grids
 This paper presents a novel method to determine the optimal strategy for the allocation of multiple resistive superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) aiming to improve the overall protection of standard power grids. The presented approach allows for the straightforward determination of the optimal resistance of the SFCL, accounting for short circuit events occurring at different locations, by modelling the electro-thermal properties of the SFCL via a temperature dependent E-J power law. This material law, based on previous experimental evidence, allows for the introduction of flux pinning, flux creep, and flux flow properties of the superconducting material within a minimum level of complexity. Thereby, we have observed a distinctive kink pattern in the current limiting profiles of the SFCLs, from which no further reduction of the first peak of the fault current is achieved when a greater resistance is considered, allowing a univocal determination of the optimum SFCL resistance. This peculiarity is not observed when the model for the quench properties of the SFCL is simplified towards an exponential resistance, although the last can be used as an auxiliary process for addressing the first guess on the resistance value required for a specific strategy, as it demands less computing time. We have also determined that for many of the cases studied, i.e., for the combinations between one or more SFCLs installed at different locations, and those subjected to fault events located at different points in the network, the recovery time of the superconducting properties of at least one of the SFCLs can last for more than 5 min, constraining the feasibility of a large-scale deployment of this technology. However, by assuming that the practical operation of the SFCL is assisted by the automatic operation of a bypass switch when the SC material is fully quenched, we have determined that the optimal strategy for the overall protection of power grids of standard topology requires a maximum of three SFCLs, with recovery times of less than a few seconds. This information is of remarkable value for power system operators, as it can establish a maximum investment threshold which ultimately can facilitate making decisions regarding the deployment of SFCL technologies.
A novel differential protection scheme for HVDC transmission lines
 Based on the compensation of the distributed capacitive current, a novel differential protection scheme for HVDC transmission lines was proposed in this study. According to the analysis, after voltage and current signals at both sides of the line are processed by the same low-pass filter the cut-off frequency of which is low enough, then the voltage distribution along the line can be regarded as linear distribution. The distributed capacitive current can be calculated by integrating the linear distributed voltage. After removing this current, the new differential criterion can be implemented. A ±800 kV HVDC transmission system was built in EMTDC to test the performance of the new protection. Comprehensive test studies show that the proposed method not only can detect internal faults correctly and quickly, but also can respond to internal faults with high ground resistance.
A morphological filtering algorithm for fault detection in transmission lines during power swings
 This paper presents a new algorithm for transmission line distance relaying, tolerant to power swings. The distinction between a short circuit and power oscillation is accomplished with the use of a morphological transform. With this feature it is possible to detect the dc short circuit component that presents a different waveshape during power swings. To show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, computer simulations have been carried out on ATP (Alternative Transient Program). Several faults including different frequency oscillations have been considered. The proposed methodology detect faults in very small times, even under the worst-case scenarios such as balanced faults during power swings.
Fault location and isolation in micro-grids using a digital central protection unit
 Currently, there are significant interests in deployment of renewable and low carbon energy sources in the form of micro-grids for local energy generation. Micro-grids operate in two modes, namely stand-alone and grid-connected. This poses a problem in micro-grid protection settings, in a sense that the fault current magnitude in a micro-grid reduces drastically during its transition from being grid-connected to stand-alone mode of operation. This paper presents a micro-grid protection scheme based on positive-sequence component using PMUs and a digital CPU. The salient feature of the proposed scheme in comparison with the previous works is that it has the ability to protect both radial and looped micro-grids against different types of faults with the capability of single-phase tripping. Furthermore, since the CPU is capable of updating its pickup values (upstream and downstream equivalent positive-sequence impedances of each line) after the first change in the micro-grid configuration (such as transferring from grid-connected to islanded mode and or disconnection of a line, bus, or DER either in grid-connected mode or in islanded mode), it can protect micro-grid against subsequent faults. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the suggested scheme and the CPU, several simulations have been undertaken by using DIgSILENT PowerFactory and MATLAB software packages.
Sequence networks to the calculation of two-simultaneous faults at the same location
 The system of symmetrical components (012-system) can be used to simulate symmetrical and asymmetrical operation of power systems. However, the classical literature of Power Systems Analysis does not present one equivalent circuit in 012-system to two-simultaneous faults where there are a single-line-to-ground fault and a bolted line-to-line fault. This paper presents the equations and the new equivalent circuit mentioned. In addition, we present a comparison of results between the proposed approach and the output of the commercial software ANAFAS, which validates the methodology. We find evidence that the new equivalent circuit developed can substitute the equivalent circuits used to calculate a single line-to-ground fault and a bolted line-to-line fault.
Low cost microcontroller based fault detector, classifier, zone identifier and locator for transmission lines using wavelet transform and artificial neural network: A hardware co-simulation approach
 A low cost, fast and reliable microcontroller based protection scheme using wavelet transform and artificial neural network has been proposed and its effectiveness evaluated in real time. The proposed scheme, based on the hardware co-simulation approach performs all the functions of transmission line protection i.e. fault detection/classification, fault zone/section identification and location estimation. The fault detection/classification and zone identification algorithms use fundamental frequency current component to estimate a fault index. The fault location estimation module uses wavelet transform coefficients in hybridization with a parallel artificial neural network structure. For hardware implementation, a 8-bit ATmega microcontroller is used and interfaced with the simulated power system model using Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The scheme is tested on a power system model of 400 kV, 50 Hz three phase double circuit line with source at both the ends. Laboratory tests have been performed in real time for 20,000 fault cases including evolving faults with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, direction of power flow angle and its magnitude. The tests confirm the suitability and reliability of proposed scheme even with Current Transformer (CT) saturation. The implementation of the proposed approach on a low cost microcontroller with the lesser execution time, makes the prototype ideal for implementation on a digital platform (digital relay), thus leading to financial viability and sustainability of the protection scheme.

 The main purpose of this article is to introduce a different method to electrify 0.5 MVA micro-loads using energy loss confined in insulated shielding wires of a 500 kV transmission line. The mathematical model of the system along with the series tuning reactor, necessary for voltage regulation, is described. Digital simulations are used to identify the maximum induced voltage in the insulated wire and the power extracted from the system. Finally, a transient analysis was presented showing that the modifications did not affect transmission line performance or reliability.
High impedance fault protection in transmission lines using a WPT-based algorithm
 This paper proposes a new algorithm for High Impedance Fault (HIF) protection, in high voltage transmission lines, with the aid of Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). The new scheme uses the HIF-induced distortion of voltage and current waveforms to detect HIF and discrimination of the fault location, respectively. The algorithm is based on a recursive method, which adds up the absolute values of high frequency signal coefficients, generated over one last cycle. Application of the proposed algorithm to the pilot protection schemes is also discussed. The proposed method is evaluated by Electro Magnetic Transients Program (EMTP) simulation studies. Several simulations, which are performed using an appropriate HIF model, bring about results which assess the proposed technique accuracy in identifying HIF in overhead transmission lines. A comprehensive simulation study shows the efficiency of the proposed protection scheme from the viewpoints of dependability and security.
Online modular level fault detection algorithm for grid-tied and off-grid PV systems
 This paper presents a new fault detection and diagnosis technique for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems operating under grid-tied and off-grid modes. The proposed technique is capable to identify the type and location (module level) of a fault. This technique relies on the local measurements, and model prediction outputs for fault detection and diagnosis. Multiple low cost sensors were used to acquire/monitor solar irradiance, PV module temperature, voltage and current at module level in a PV system. A low cost PV monitoring system based on power line communication (PLC) to monitor the status of each PV module is also described in this work. A new algorithm is developed to detect different types of faults, and to display other essential system information (with a watch window size of 10 min). Additionally, a user friendly web application is developed for easy access of monitored data via Internet. The proposed technique is shown to have lower computational requirements; therefore, the same microcontroller is used for data communication and fault detection without any external hardware or additional simulation software. This technique has been experimentally validated using the PV system developed at the Solar Laboratory, Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC), IIT Roorkee, India. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed technique in detecting the various fault occurrences in both grid-tied and off-grid PV system.
Dynamic modeling of gearbox faults: A review
 Gearbox is widely used in industrial and military applications. Due to high service load, harsh operating conditions or inevitable fatigue, faults may develop in gears. If the gear faults cannot be detected early, the health will continue to degrade, perhaps causing heavy economic loss or even catastrophe. Early fault detection and diagnosis allows properly scheduled shutdowns to prevent catastrophic failure and consequently result in a safer operation and higher cost reduction. Recently, many studies have been done to develop gearbox dynamic models with faults aiming to understand gear fault generation mechanism and then develop effective fault detection and diagnosis methods. This paper focuses on dynamics based gearbox fault modeling, detection and diagnosis. State-of-art and challenges are reviewed and discussed. This detailed literature review limits research results to the following fundamental yet key aspects: gear mesh stiffness evaluation, gearbox damage modeling and fault diagnosis techniques, gearbox transmission path modeling and method validation. In the end, a summary and some research prospects are presented.
Hybrid online protocols for source location privacy in wireless sensor networks
 Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) will form the building blocks of many novel applications such as asset monitoring. These applications will have to guarantee that the location of the occurrence of specific events is kept private from attackers, in what is called the source location privacy (SLP) problem. Fake sources have been used in numerous techniques, however, the solution’s efficiency is typically achieved by fine-tuning parameters at compile time. This is undesirable as WSN conditions may change. In this paper, we first present an SLP algorithm – Dynamic  – that estimates the relevant parameters at runtime and show that it provides a high level of SLP, albeit at the expense of a high number of messages. To address this, we provide a hybrid online algorithm – DynamicSPR  – that uses directed random walks for the fake sources allocation strategy to reduce energy usage. We perform simulations of the various protocols we present and our results show that DynamicSPR provides a similar level of SLP as when parameters are optimised at compile-time, with a lower number of messages sent.
Fault detection and diagnosis methods for photovoltaic systems: A review
 Faults in any components (modules, connection lines, converters, inverters, etc.) of photovoltaic (PV) systems (stand-alone, grid-connected or hybrid PV systems) can seriously affect the efficiency, energy yield as well as the security and reliability of the entire PV plant, if not detected and corrected quickly. In addition, if some faults persist (e.g. arc fault, ground fault and line-to-line fault) they can lead to risk of fire. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods are indispensable for the system reliability, operation at high efficiency, and safety of the PV plant. In this paper, the types and causes of PV systems (PVS) failures are presented, then different methods proposed in literature for FDD of PVS are reviewed and discussed; particularly faults occurring in PV arrays (PVA). Special attention is paid to methods that can accurately detect, localise and classify possible faults occurring in a PVA. The advantages and limits of FDD methods in terms of feasibility, complexity, cost-effectiveness and generalisation capability for large-scale integration are highlighted. Based on the reviewed papers, challenges and recommendations for future research direction are also provided.
Wavelet-fuzzy based protection scheme of EHV-AC transmission system and efficacy of discrete Fourier transform
 Extra high voltage (EHV) transmission system is the vital links between the generating units and the transmission substations. Transmission of power to the utilities located over long distances through extra high voltage (EHV) transmission is efficient and cost effective. It has the advantage of allowing the bulk amount of energy transmission from generating units to the widely distributed load centers economically. However, detection of faults on EHV transmission system is critical and a challenging task for a large variation in fault operating condition such as high fault resistance involved, inception of fault at the voltage zero crossing situation and the variation in load angles and the system loading levels. Moreover, fault characteristics on EHV transmission lines differ to those on medium and high voltage (MV/HV) due to the presence of larger shunt capacitance, higher voltage level, longer transmission radius and weakly damped decaying dc current caused by the high system reactance to resistance ratio. A number of deterministic and intelligent models based protection schemes of transmission systems are endorsed by several authors where attempts have been made to detect, classify and to locate the fault and the faulted section of the line but they have their own limitations and complexities and the results are not satisfactory. Keeping in view of the aforesaid difficulties, this paper proposes a new approach for the protection of EHV-AC transmission system based on novel application of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in combination with fuzzy logic using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) at the fundamental frequency phasor. The proposed method retains both fundamental and the high frequency components of the fault current signals to achieve high reliability and selectivity of the protection. The obtained results have been validated with the well established mathematical model of the given EHV-AC transmission system. It is found that the proposed method is accurate, computationally simpler, faster and valid for a wide range of fault operating conditions.
Distance-differential protection of transmission lines connected to wind farms
 Distance relays are often used in the protection of the transmission lines connected to the wind farms. The distance relay using the transmission line impedance measurement identifies the type and location of the fault. However any other factors that cause the failure of the measured impedance, makes the relay detect the fault in incorrect location or do not detect the fault at all. One of these factors is the fault resistance which directly increases the measured impedance by the relay. One of the methods to eliminate relay under-reach effect is using of the trip boundaries. Trip boundaries are changing with wind variation and following with output power of the wind farms. Therefore, trip boundaries should continuously change proportional by the wind speed. In this paper, a method is provided based on the combination of distance and differential protection. In this method, using active power calculation in both ends of the transmission line, fault resistance is calculated and its effects are directly deducted from the calculated impedance by the relay. Therefore, variable trip boundaries are not needed anymore. Also in this method, unlike the technique that the trip boundaries are used, the exact location of fault and its distance from the relay also is calculated. Detailed model of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by a wind turbine is used in the modelling. Results of studies show that the presented method eliminates properly the mal-operation of relays under all different fault resistance conditions.
An integrated technique for fault location and section identification in distribution systems
 This paper proposes an integrated impedance and transient-based formulation for fault location in distribution systems. The technique uses an extended apparent impedance analysis in order to estimate the fault distance, taking into account the unbalanced operation, intermediate loads, laterals, and time-varying load profile of distribution systems. The fault distance information is used in calculating characteristic frequencies associated to each possible fault location. A transient analysis is proposed to evaluate the spectral content of the fault-generated traveling wave, thus identifying its most significant frequency components. Based on the time–frequency correlation it is possible to eliminate the multiple estimates obtained from the impedance-based method, thus resulting in a single fault location. Aiming to verify the application of the proposed methodology, simulations were carried out in the ATP/EMTP Software considering a real distribution feeder with 3472 buses.
Distance protection for transmission lines of DFIG-based wind power integration system
 This paper proposes a distance relay in time domain based on the R-L differential-equation algorithm which is suitable for wind power integration system. However, the conventional R-L differential-equation algorithm cannot detect the correct fault direction if the fault point is very close to the relay location. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on this problematic conditions and proposes a solution. The instantaneous value equivalent model of DFIG is established and characteristics of the transient electromotive force (EMF) of DFIG after the faults are also analyzed, which shows that the EMF of DFIG has the inertia within a short time after the faults. The memory voltage drop and actual voltage drop on equivalent impedance from relay location to back-side and opposite-side equivalent power sources are introduced in this paper to detect the fault direction. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the memory voltage drop and actual voltage drop under forward and reverse fault conditions are deduced, respectively. With the differentiated correlation coefficient between the memory voltage drop and actual voltage drop under different fault conditions (forward and reverse fault), the fault direction identification criterion is formed accordingly. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can detect the fault direction quickly with high sensitivity during zero-voltage fault conditions.
A high-available and location predictive data gathering scheme with mobile sinks for wireless sensor networks
 The use of mobile sinks in a wireless sensor network can effectively improve network performance. However, if a mobile sink fails, the entire network performance will be seriously affected. In this paper, we propose a high-available and location predictive data gathering scheme with mobile sinks to address the mentioned issue. Namely, sensor nodes can calculate the current location of mobile sinks based on time synchronization, and the network could still work normally if some of the mobile sinks fail. Considering the energy consumption of nodes in different areas, a moving trajectory adjusting strategy is also proposed to balance energy consumption among the nodes in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed data gathering scheme has better performance than the existing schemes.
Experimental and numerical modelling of buried pipelines crossing reverse faults
 Fault rupture is one of the main hazards for continuous buried pipelines and the problem is often investigated experimentally and numerically. While experimental data exists for pipeline crossing strike-slip and normal fault, limited experimental work is available for pipeline crossing reverse faults. This paper presents results from a series of tests investigating the behaviour of continuous buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault motion. A new experimental setup for physical modelling of pipeline crossing reverse fault is developed and described. Scaling laws and non-dimensional groups are derived and subsequently used to analyse the test results. Three-dimensional Finite Element (3D FE) analysis is also carried out using ABAQUS to investigate the pipeline response to reverse faults and to simulate the experiments. Finally, practical implications of the study are discussed.
An algorithm based on traveling waves for transmission line protection in a TCSC environment
 This paper describes a new relaying algorithm for the protection of transmission lines with a Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC). The algorithm is based on the pattern of traveling waves generated during a fault event. Several tools like modal analysis, the discrete wavelet transform and a probabilistic neural network trained to work with the energy contained in the wavelet transform coefficients are applied to analyze the high frequency pattern generated during the fault. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting, locating and classifying faults in a reliable way. The impact of harmonic frequencies generated by the TCSC in the protection algorithm was also analyzed. Several studies were carried out in order to validate and to assess the effect of several fault parameters on the algorithm accuracy. The obtained results show that for a sampling rate of 100 kHz, the algorithm error in calculating the distance to the fault is less than one percent of the total transmission line length. A higher sampling rate improves the algorithm accuracy.
Capacitive discharge based transient analysis with fault detection methodology in DC system
 Multi-terminal DC (MTDC) system based on voltage source converter (VSC) promises a new opportunity for bulk power transmission but it is still met with dire protection issues. This paper presents a transient analysis based on DC-link capacitive discharge which can be leveraged to design a fault detection method. Under certain critical fault conditions, the fault-induced transient can be quite weak for fault detection to work properly. However, the proposed method is minimally influenced by the fault location and resistance. The fault detection time can be kept within 1 ms, which is well-suited to the requirement of the DC circuit breaker. Another important feature of this method is the ability to distinctly recognize the bus fault and external faults, such as AC fault and sudden blocking of gate signal. Besides that, it only requires the local measurement at the terminal to perform necessary computations. The fault detection is tested on a simulation model developed in PSCAD/EMTDC and experimental model, from which different fault types and conditions are investigated. For fair evaluation, the performance of this method on MTDC system is compared with di/dt method.
Fault detection in transmission networks of power systems
 An online fault detection scheme for a sample power system is introduced in this paper. The detection approach is based on the use of a variable structure system called “sliding mode observer”, where information contained in the output measurements is utilized to detect the onset of faults in the transmission network of the sample power system in real time and online. The power system comprises a generating unit connected to an infinite bus through double line transmission network. The common case of a fault occurring on a transmission line is illustrated through simulation studies.
A new impedance-based fault location scheme for overhead unbalanced radial distribution networks
 This paper proposes an analytical impedance-based fault location scheme for distribution systems. The approach is based on voltage and current measurements extracted at only one-end feeding substation. Modal transformation is implemented to decompose the coupled three phase equations due to mutual effects into decoupled ones, and hence directly calculating fault distance in each section without iterative processes. The proposed approach considers various aspects of distribution systems: intermediate loads along the feeder, tapped laterals and sub-laterals at various nodes, time varying loads, and unbalanced operations. The proposed algorithm is extensively investigated on a typical real 11 kV distribution system, South Delta electricity sector, Egypt using MATLAB environment. Different cases are studied considering various loading conditions, varied fault resistance values and different fault types. The achieved results ensure the effectiveness of the proposed fault locator irrespective to fault conditions. Besides, the robustness of the proposed scheme against unbalanced loading, network topology change and non-homogenous network sections is also confirmed.
Post-fault prediction of transient instabilities using stacked sparse autoencoder
 Post-fault prediction of transient stability of power systems has a great impact on the performance of wide area monitoring, protection and control systems. Situational awareness capabilities of a power system are improved by fast detection of instabilities after severe fault occurrences. This allows sufficient time to take necessary corrective control actions. In this paper, a novel method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed to predict the post-fault transient stability status of the power system directly after clearing the fault. A dataset is generated off-line to train a stacked sparse autoencoder, and then the trained stacked sparse autoencoder is used in an online application of predicting any transient instability. The stacked sparse autoencoder is fed by the inputs, which are specific points extracted from the fault-on voltage magnitude measurements collected from the phasor measurement units. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated and compared with the conventional approaches that adopt multilayer perceptrons or post-fault measurements as it is applied to the 127-bus WSCC test system and to the Turkish power system.
Fault diagnosis and on-line monitoring for grid-connected single-phase inverters
 The functionality of power electronic converter systems (PECS) is a cornerstone in various industrial applications. One of the key requirements to ensure reliable functions of PECS is the analysis of their behavior during fault conditions. Characterizing the behavior of PECS during the fault conditions can provide a standpoint for enhancing their control and protection algorithms. Moreover, effective solutions for on-line monitoring for PECS are significant in order to improve the system supervision and management. Consequently, this paper presents fault diagnosis and on-line monitoring schemes for grid-connected single-phase inverters in typical commercial PECS utilized for renewable energy distributed generation. The paper provides fault detection, classification and location of the open circuit (O-C) faults which do not trigger the standard protection systems in the single-phase inverters. The proposed fault diagnostic algorithm is implemented by adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm and it is based solely on the inverter output current measurements. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires much fewer inputs compared to the previous research works. Furthermore, the paper implements an on-line monitoring by using a communication interface board which is connected to graphical user interface (GUI) software through transmission control and internet protocols (TCP/IP). The GUI software integrates the on-line monitoring for the electrical signals of the single-phase inverter, as well as incorporates a real time database for these signals.
Methodology for optimizing the capacity and costs of overhead transmission lines by modifying their bundle geometry
 The electrical power systems demand is continuously growing, in such a way that it is necessary to pursue methods to increase the overhead transmission line power capacity for single circuit lines. In this paper, it is proposed a methodology to increase the line energy transport capacity at lower costs. The enhancement is done by modifying the bundle geometry by using a heuristic optimization process divided into two steps. Firstly, a fixed bundle geometry is generated. Secondly, this form is modified seeking the optimization of line energy transmission capacities. During all process, electrical, mechanical and economical analyses are performed. As result, single circuit line geometries with almost 26% higher surge impedance loading than the original, significant costs reduction (50%), moderate bundles size (smaller than 2.5 m), similar electric fields within the conductors of the bundle, smaller right of way, and similar transient response were obtained. Thus, compared with regular single circuit transmission lines, these new transmission lines have a lower overall cost and environmental impact. Finally, a transient analysis of the proposed transmission line is presented.
Generalized formulation of the optimal monitor placement problem for fault location
 This paper extends and generalizes the formulation of the optimal monitor placement problem for fault location for its implementation on large power systems. The proposed formulation, which models the monitor placement as an integer linear programming problem, is applied on several test systems including the IEEE reliability test system (RTS) and the IEEE 118-bus power flow test system. It was found that two monitors are sufficient in order to correctly locate any fault occurring throughout the RTS network. Studies on the 118-bus system revealed that full fault location observability can be achieved with 13 monitors. Simulation results from these studies show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach.
Critical Ground Fault Position
 This chapter presents the analytical procedure that enables a quick and sufficiently accurate evaluation of the significant parts of the ground fault current, for a fault at any of the towers of a transmission line of an arbitrary number of spans. The advantages of the method emanate from the simplicity and accuracy of the formulae for solving uniform ladder circuits of any size and any terminal conditions. The formulae are obtained by applying the “general equations of discrete parameter ladder circuits” on a specific electrical circuit formed by a transmission line ground wire during ground fault. The presented method is suitable for analyses aimed at evaluating the maximum ground fault current part passing through the grounding system of high-voltage generating substations, selecting the ground wire capable of withstanding the fault currents, and predicting the step and touch voltages near transmission towers of single-circuit or double-circuit lines.
Geomechanical analysis of the influence of CO2 injection location on fault stability
 Large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) should be injected in deep saline formations to mitigate climate change, implying geomechanical challenges that require further understanding. Pressure build-up induced by CO2 injection will decrease the effective stresses and may affect fault stability. Geomechanical effects of overpressure induced by CO2 injection either in the hanging wall or in the foot wall on fault stability are investigated. CO2 injection in the presence of a low-permeable fault induces pressurization of the storage formation between the injection well and the fault. The low permeability of the fault hinders fluid flow across it and leads to smaller overpressure on the other side of the fault. This variability in the fluid pressure distribution gives rise to differential total stress changes around the fault that reduce its stability. Despite a significant pressure build-up induced by the fault, caprock stability around the injection well is not compromised and thus, CO2 leakage across the caprock is unlikely to happen. The decrease in fault stability is similar regardless of the side of the fault where CO2 is injected. Simulation results show that fault core permeability has a significant effect on fault stability, becoming less affected for high-permeable faults. An appropriate pressure management will allow storing large quantities of CO2 without inducing fault reactivation.
Emergency transmission line switching to suppress power system inter-area oscillation
 Electromechanical oscillation is an inherent property of ac power systems which can occur in the forms of local and inter-area oscillations. The inter-area oscillations may impose a serious threat on the system if they are not controlled properly. Over the past two decades, many methods have been introduced to control and suppress electromechanical oscillations. This paper proposes a new supplementary emergency damping control (SEDC) to suppress inter-area oscillations. In the proposed approach, a system brittleness index (SBI) is introduced which can show system risk for splitting into uncontrolled islands. Following a sever fault, the value and sign of SBI is used as an indicator for activation of SEDC. By using sensitivity analysis of the inter-area mode with respect to line switching, the most effective transmission line switching (TLS) is utilized as an emergency damping control for suppressing inter-area oscillations. For this purpose, by offline studies, a priority list of the effective lines switching is prepared. Then, in the real time operational environment, by using an optimization algorithm, the most effective line switching is implemented as SEDC activation. The optimization algorithm guarantees system operation against any potential violation due to line switching. The proposed SEDC has been demonstrated on IEEE 39-buses system with promising results.
Fault ride through strategy of inverter-interfaced microgrids embedded in distributed network considering fault current management
 This paper presents a fault ride through (FRT) strategy specific for a microgrid (MG) with an inverter-based interface (IB-MG) to maintain power exchange with distribution networks during network faults or disturbances. The fault current injected by IB-MG is controlled by its back-to-back converter interface. Besides guaranteeing the power quality of local loads in MGs during faults, the proposed IB-MG FRT could realize the fault current management (FCM) ability – instead of using a fault current limiter – to maintain the short circuit current level in a dense-load network. As the traditional three-phase FRT techniques conducted on the double synchronous reference frame are no longer applicable on IB-MG FRT, especially for unbalanced faults, a newly developed reference current calculation method conducted on the stationary reference frame is adopted and modified. By changing the six control variables – amplitudes and phases of the three-phase currents – based on the information of the fault voltages and the fault currents from the host network, IB-MG FRT could achieve multiple effects: (1) controlling instantaneous energy flow between the MG and the distribution network; (2) limiting the short-circuit current increase; (3) improving the MG system power quality. The application range of the proposed FRT strategy is also discussed. A 27 kV distributed network connected with a 5 MW IB-MG system was built in the MATLAB/Simulink software environment and the proposed IB-MG FRT strategy was demonstrated under the different unbalanced fault scenarios.
Accurate fault location algorithm for double-circuit series compensated lines using a limited number of two-end synchronized measurements
 This paper presents a new fault location algorithm for double-circuit series compensated lines based on synchronized phasor measurements. Only the sequence current phasors from both ends of the line and the sequence voltage phasors from one local end are taken as input, limiting thus the amount of data needed to be exchanged between the line terminals. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not utilize the model of the series compensation device, eliminating thus the errors resulting from modeling such devices. The new algorithm consists of three steps. In the first step, the fault type and the circuit(s) involved in the fault are determined using a synchrophasor-based fault type selection method. In the next step, the algorithm applies two subroutines designating for locating faults on particular line sections which are defined according to the series compensation placement along the line. In these subroutines, the sequence voltages and currents at the fault point are expressed with respect to the known sequence voltages and currents at the two measuring ends and the distance to fault. Then, using the fault boundary conditions that exist for a given fault type, the fault location is solved by an iterative method. Finally, in the last step a procedure for selecting the valid subroutine is applied. Due to zero sequence mutual coupling, it is not straightforward to express the zero sequence voltage and current at the fault point as a function of the zero sequence voltages and currents at the measuring ends and the distance to fault. To overcome this problem, a modal transformation matrix is introduced to obtain the modal networks, which are decoupled and can be analyzed independently. Based on distributed parameter line model, the proposed algorithm fully considers the effects of shunt capacitances and thus achieves superior locating accuracy, especially for long lines. Mutual coupling between circuits, source impedances and fault resistance does not influence the locating accuracy of the algorithm. Simulation results using ATP-EMTP and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
Decentralized detection of hybrid faults in mobile sensor nodes
 The widespread use of sensor nodes that are operating under the Internet of Things paradigm motivates researcher to step forward and build reliable systems capable of detecting their faulty nodes. These nodes lead to decrease in the accuracy and functionality of the networks, which finally result in quality degradation of network services. From the temporal point of view, the faults can be either permanent or intermittent. The detection of the latter one is more challenging since the nodes show contradictory behaviors at different times. from the topological point of view, the mobility of the sensor nodes is an intrinsic characteristic in many IoT-based applications, where numerous mobile nodes are managed by static overlay nodes. The dynamics of these network introduces the second challenge in identifying faulty nodes. Several works have been conducted to address the problem, but there is a research gap in identifying hybrid soft sensor faults in the aforementioned networks. The focus of attention in this paper is the detection of soft faults in the sensing unit of the nodes. We devised a new method, called Hybrid Fault Detection in Mobile Sensors, to detect nodes with mixed permanent and intermittent faults. A software debugging approach inspired the main idea. We also applied data mining techniques such as DBSCAN and K-means to validate sensed data, and differentiate the classes of faults, respectively. We evaluated the devised method using the NS2 simulator in various situations. One of the outcomes of the method is that the mobility of the nodes does not reduce the accuracy, in contrast to most of the traditional methods. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates promising results for the networks with more than 50% faulty nodes. The results also show perfect performance in detecting permanent and intermittent faults in the networks with various percentage of faulty nodes.
Electrical resistivity imaging in transmission between surface and underground tunnel for fault characterization
 Electrical resistivity images supply information on sub-surface structures and are classically performed to characterize faults geometry. Here we use the presence of a tunnel intersecting a regional fault to inject electrical currents between surface and the tunnel to improve the image resolution at depth. We apply an original methodology for defining the inversion parametrization based on pilot points to better deal with the heterogeneous sounding of the medium. An increased region of high spatial resolution is shown by analysis of point spread functions as well as inversion of synthetics. Such evaluations highlight the advantages of using transmission measurements by transferring a few electrodes from the main profile to increase the sounding depth. Based on the resulting image we propose a revised structure for the medium surrounding the Cernon fault supported by geological observations and muon flux measurements.
Influence of fault type on the optimal location of superconducting fault current limiter in electrical power grid
 This paper presents a novel approach to determine the optimal location of a resistive superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) to improve the transient stability of an electric power grid (EPG). The presented method use the angular separation of the rotors of synchronous machines present in the power system to select the optimal location of SFCL. The selection of this optimal location is coordinated with the corresponding optimal resistive value to improve transient stability in case of short-circuit fault. To obtain a global study on the optimal placement of SFCL in case of fault, various types of short-circuits are considered (single phase grounded fault, two phases grounded fault, etc.). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the IEEE benchmarked four-machine two-area test system is used to carry out several case studies. It is shown that the optimal location of SFCL as well as its optimal resistance value are not the same for each fault studied. A global analysis of EPG stability is presented in the paper to select only one location of the SFCL in the EPG. Results show that the optimal location of SFCL combined with its optimal resistive value reduces the angular separation of the rotors that improves effectively the stability of the EPG for any type of short-circuit.
Transmission line individual phase impedance and related pilot protection
 This paper proposes a kind of new Individual Phase Impedance (IPI) and a novel pilot protection scheme for transmission line based on the IPI. The IPI is calculated by the ratio of the voltage difference of fault-superimposed component to the current difference of fault-superimposed component at both terminals of the protected line. The IPI has accurate mathematical expressions and reasonable physical definitions for various line models. The calculated result of IPI can be used to distinguish the internal faults from the external faults. When the IPI is identical to the value of line positive-sequence impedance, the external fault is detected; otherwise, the internal fault is detected if it differs from that value. The feature of the pilot protection scheme is that the inter-phase coupling relation and the distributed capacitance based on the three-phase line model are directly considered and included in the IPI expression. The novel pilot protection can be used for long distance HV transmission lines with some preeminent performances which are deficiency in the conventional directional comparison pilot protection and current differential protection. The test results obtained by EMTP simulation and from a laboratory model of a simplified real power system have demonstrated that the pilot protection is of high reliability and good adaptability.
Unsymmetrical fault diagnosis in transmission/distribution networks
 In this paper, we design a model-based fault diagnosis scheme capable of real time detection of symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in the transmission/distribution network of a sample power system comprising a single-machine connected to an infinite bus-bar. A generic state space linear model of the system is first derived, and then a fault diagnosis scheme is designed, based on sliding mode observer (SMO) theory. Accuracy and real-time fault detection capabilities of the proposed fault diagnosis scheme are illustrated through simulation studies.
Fault identification based on artificial immunological systems
 The growing tendency in the number of distributed generation units, directly connected at the distribution level, inevitably brings a number of new challenges. One of the effects is that this new topology may influence the performance of analysis methods and techniques that were based on traditional systems. Fault location methods in distribution systems are examples of how inserting of new generation sources can change the efficiency of these tools. Considering that fault location is a fundamental step to help distribution companies to maintain reliability indices within acceptable margins, this work presents a method applicable to both traditional systems and systems with the presence of distributed generators. In order to achieve this goal, a methodology was developed based on artificial immunological systems technique, which is generally used to complex problems-solving. The methodology evaluated considering several scenarios in the test system and presented a satisfactory performance, being able to estimate characteristics such as location, fault type and fault resistance in an efficient way.
Experimental demonstration of the real-time online fault monitoring technique for chaos-based passive optical networks
 In this paper, a real-time online fault monitoring technique for chaos-based passive optical networks (PONs) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The fault monitoring is performed by the chaotic communication signal. The proof-of-concept experiments are demonstrated for two PON structures, i.e., wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) PON and Ethernet PON (EPON), respectively. For WDM PON, two monitoring approaches are investigated, one deploying a chaotic optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) for each transmitter, and the other using only one tunable chaotic OTDR. The experimental results show that the faults at beyond 20 km from the OLT can be detected and located. The spatial resolution of the tunable chaotic OTDR is an order of magnitude of centimeter. Meanwhile, the monitoring process can operate in parallel with the chaotic optical secure communications. The proposed technique has benefits of real-time, online, precise fault location, and simple realization, which will significantly reduce the cost of operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) of PON.
A DSP based frequency domain approach for classification of transmission line faults
 This paper employs a digital signal processing (DSP) based frequency domain approach using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA) to overcome difficulties such as fault inception angle, fault impedance and fault distance associated with conventional time domain approach employing voltage and current based measurements for fault classification in case of digital relaying of transmission line. The frequency domain approach for fault classification algorithm uses wavelet MRA technique to extract the features of the current signals based on harmonics generated at the instant of occurrence of fault due to abrupt change of currents in a three phase transmission line. Since choice of particular wavelet plays a vital role for extracting features of generated harmonics, therefore an attempt has been made in this proposed research to extensively investigate using 16 wavelets to establish the superiority of Db4 wavelet over other standard wavelets for accurate fault classification.
A time domain differential equation approach using distributed parameter line model for transmission line fault location algorithm
 The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm which can provide both a fast relaying time (1/4–1/2 cycles) and an accurate fault location (error within 1% of the total line length). The proposed algorithm combines the strengths of the two distinct approaches, namely, the steady-state phasor approaches (SSPA) and the differential equation approaches (DEA). In the proposed algorithm, a distributed line model is used, which is suitable for the short, the long, the transposed and the untransposed lines. The DEA is used to calculate the fault location and is implemented using the Laplace and the Z-transform techniques. There are several advantages in this proposed algorithm over the existing ones: (a) the variations in the line parameters with the frequency are considered; (b) the fault location estimate is less sensitive to the selection of the sampling rate, the fault inception angle, the signal spectrum and the equivalent sources behind both bus bars; and (c) the relay performance is greatly improved offering both the desired high accuracy and the speed at the same time.
Simulation and experimental analysis of rolling element bearing fault in rotor-bearing-casing system
 The rotor-bearing-casing system is an important structural form in aero-engines, where the main shaft bearing plays an important role in the safe and efficient operation of the whole engine. To study the performance of rolling element bearing faults and their transmission characteristics, a dynamic model of rotor-bearing-casing system with a nonlinear rolling element bearing is established in this paper. The rotor and the casing are modelled by finite element method and the rest parts are modelled by lumped mass method. The casing part is built using a kind of 2-D curved beam element. Single and mixed localized bearing defects are simulated in this dynamic model and also introduced in the rotor-bearing-casing system test system, then vibration signals from the bearing pedestal and the casing are obtained and analyzed. The simulation has a good prediction in components of bearing fault characteristic and modulation frequencies, which could be extracted from the experimental signals. Results are compared between the bearing pedestal and the casing, also between the simulation and the experiment. And sensitivity analysis could be conducted based on fault feature extraction and analysis at different locations on the flexible casing.
Global sensitivity analysis of transmission line fault-locating algorithms using sparse grid regression
 Computation of distance to fault on an electrical transmission line is affected by many sources of uncertainty, including parameter setting errors, measurement errors, as well as absence of information and incomplete modelling of a system under fault condition. In this paper we propose an application of the variance-based global sensitivity measures for evaluation of fault location algorithms. The main goal of the evaluation is to identify factors and their interactions that contribute to the fault locator output variability. This analysis is based on the results of Sparse Grid Regression. The method compiles the Functional ANOVA model to represent fault locator output as a function of uncertain factors. The ANOVA model provides a tool for interpretation and sensitivity analysis. In practice, such analysis can help in functional performance tests, especially in: selection of the optimal fault location algorithm (device) for a specific application, calibration process and building confidence in a fault location function result. The paper concludes with an application example which demonstrates use of the proposed methodology in testing and comparing some commonly used fault location algorithms. This example is also used to demonstrate numerical efficiency for this type of application of the proposed Sparse Grid Regression method in comparison to the Quasi-Monte Carlo approach.
A new technique, based on voltages, for fault location on three-terminal transmission lines
 A new method for fault location on three-terminal transmission lines is described in this paper. Through this method, the faulty line branch is determined and the fault point located in a reliable and simple manner. For this, to reduce mathematical errors, a complete line model including the various characteristics of the network is used and a simple calculation method is applied, based on a new concept referred to as the ‘branch factor’. The method only uses the main components (50/60 Hz) of fault and prefault voltage values measured at the three terminals of the transmission line. Moreover, this method is independent of the fault and prefault current, type of fault and fault resistance, as well as the synchronization of recording devices located at the three terminals of the transmission line, and the prefault conditions. This paper also reviews the sensitivity of this method to errors in input data.
Investigation of the Effect of Series Compensation on Fault Location for EHV Transmission Lines
 This paper describes an accurate fault location algorithms based on two end measurements of voltage and current phasors for EHV transmission lines. The algorithm is implemented for plain, shunt and series compensated, transposed and untransposed transmission lines. The algorithm is free of source impedance variations and includes the effect of shunt capacitance. The effect on the accuracy of the algorithm due to point on wave of fault initiation, fault location on the line, fault type, variations of the fault resistance and errors due to signal processing, is investigated. The algorithm is found to be very accurate for plain and shunt compensated lines but needs further improvements to cater for series compensated lines.
New method of fault location on double-circuit two-terminal transmission lines
 A new method to locate faults on double-circuit transmission lines is described in this paper. This method only uses the fundamental components (50/60 Hz) of fault and prefault currents, measured at one of the ends of the line. From these measured values a function is established from which the point at which a fault occurred is determined. The definition of a new concept called the ‘distance factor’ will allow a method to be developed which is independent of fault resistance, type of fault, mutual coupling between the two circuits and initial prefault conditions. The accuracy of this method has been assessed by using a fault simulation software program. In the first stage the accuracy of the method was determined on the basis of accurate input data. In the second stage the sensitivity of the method was analyzed from errors in the input data.
Fault tolerance in cloud computing environment: A systematic survey
 Fault tolerance is among the most imperative issues in cloud to deliver reliable services. It is difficult to implement due to dynamic service infrastructure, complex configurations and various interdependencies existing in cloud. Extensive research efforts are consistently being made to implement the fault tolerance in cloud. Implementation of a fault tolerance policy in cloud not only needs specific knowledge of its application domain, but a comprehensive analysis of the background and various prevalent techniques also. Some recent surveys try to assimilate the various fault tolerance architectures and approaches proposed for cloud environment but seem to be limited on some accounts. This paper gives a systematic and comprehensive elucidation of different fault types, their causes and various fault tolerance approaches used in cloud. The paper presents a broad survey of various fault tolerance frameworks in the context of their basic approaches, fault applicability, and other key features. A comparative analysis of the surveyed frameworks is also included in the paper. For the first time, on the basis of an analysis of various fault tolerance frameworks cited in the present paper as well as included in the recently published prime surveys, a quantified view on their applicability is presented. It is observed that primarily the checkpoint-restart and replication oriented fault tolerance techniques are used to target the crash faults in cloud.
Adaptive distance protection of transmission line in presence of SVC
 In this paper, the analytical and simulation results of the application of adaptive distance protection scheme for the transmission line incorporating Static Var Compensator (SVC) connected at the mid-point is presented. The mal-operation of the distance protection for the transmission line with SVC at various locations are studied. The simulation results show the under-reaching and over-reaching is more severe with SVC at mid-point of the transmission line. To mitigate the mal-operation of the distance protection, the adaptive scheme is presented based on recursive simulation study. The simulation result with adaptive scheme is outperformed as compared with the conventional scheme. Electro-magnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulations on two machine system is used to substantiate the claim.
Fault mode operation strategies for dual H-bridge current flow controller in meshed HVDC grid
 Current flow controllers (CFCs) can remove grid bottlenecks or extend grid operation area by changing amount of power flowing through DC transmission lines. This study focuses on behavior of interline H-bridge CFC in a DC grid in fault condition. In addition to the CFC circuit level fault studies, non-linear and linearized simplified models are developed for system level analysis. The analysis and fault study shows that the interline H-bridge CFC cannot survive during DC transmission line and bus faults due to an overvoltage occurring in its capacitor. Further investigation figures out that this overvoltage cannot be avoided even in presence of fast HVDC circuit breakers. Hence, an improved control system together with circuit level modifications are proposed to improve the CFC post-fault operation and to retain its components from possible damages.
Intelligent approaches using support vector machine and extreme learning machine for transmission line protection
 This paper proposes two approaches based on wavelet transform-support vector machine (WT-SVM) and wavelet transform-extreme learning machine (WT-ELM) for transmission line protection. These methods uses fault current samples for half cycle from the inception of fault. The features of the line currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and extracted features are applied as inputs to SVM and ELM for faulted phase detection, fault classification, location and discrimination between fault and switching transient condition. The feasibility of the proposed methods have been tested on a 240-kV, 225-km transmission line for all the 10 types of fault using MATLAB Simulink. Upon testing on 9600 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, pre-fault power level, and source impedances, the performance of the proposed methods are quite promising. The performance of the proposed methods is compared in terms of classification accuracy and fault location error. The results indicate that SVM based approach is accurate compared to ELM based approach for fault classification. For fault location, the maximum error is less with SVM than ELM and the mean error of SVM is slightly higher than ELM.
Differential relaying scheme for tapped transmission line connecting UPFC and wind farm
 This paper presents a differential relaying scheme for a tapped transmission line in presence of Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and wind-farm together. The process starts at retrieving the fault current signal at the respective busses connecting the lines involving fault and pre-processing it using multi-resolution based Wavelet transform to derive third level approximate coefficients (CA3). Further the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to compute the RMS value of the signal from the reconstructed signals expressed in terms of Wavelet approximate coefficients. Once the RMS value of the signal is estimated the operating (tripping) and restraining signals are computed for fault detection and classification in transmission lines including UPFC and wind-farm. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested on faulted conditions with wide variations in operating parameters and the test results indicate that it can reliably detect and classify faults including the ability to discriminate internal faults from external faults in transmission lines with a response time of less than two cycles from fault inception.
On-line Monitoring System Based on Open Source Platform for Photovoltaic Array
 To evaluate the performance of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, it is necessary to effectively monitor PV power plants. An on-line monitoring system based on open-source platform is presented for monitoring and managing the PV power plant effectively and economically. The proposed monitoring system consists of data acquisition, transmission part, data gateway, and on-line monitoring center. A PV diagnosis approach based on FFA-SVM for array fault is implemented in the gateway. The on-line monitoring center based on the platform ubidots is designed for displaying the data and monitoring PV arrays. Experiment results show that the system can realize abundant data visualization and accurate PV fault diagnosis.
A wavelet multiresolution analysis for location of faults on transmission lines
 Faults on EHV lines are quite common. They cause disruption in power supply. Accurate location of faults will result in faster maintenance and restoration of supply. This paper presents a new method for the location of faults based on wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA). EMTP (Microtran) is employed to generate the time domain input signal. Daubechies eight (D-8) wavelet transforms of the three phase currents on transmission lines from both the ends are used. The effects of fault inception angle and fault impedance are examined. Extensive simulation work has been carried out and results indicate that the proposed method is very effective in locating the fault with a high accuracy.
Internal converter- and DC-fault handling for a single point grounded bipolar MMC-HVDC system
 In order to address challenges caused by an increasing need for power transmission, embedded bipolar HVDC links utilizing Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC-HVDC) technology present a preferred solution as several operational and dynamic advantages compared to conventional ac grid enforcement are provided. In this paper, an approach to quickly detect and handle internal as well as dc-side faults in a full-bridge bipolar MMC-HVDC link is presented. Due to non-technical reasons and environmental constraints, the system is comprised of mixed overheadline-cable (OHL-cable) transmission and single point solid grounding with dedicated metallic return (DMR). To validate and evaluate the proposed concept, detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are provided. These highlight effects of mixed transmission system design on transient voltage and current stresses as well as on converter-internal quantities.
A novel wavelet transform aided neural network based transmission line fault analysis method
 In the present scenario of market driven business, power supply has become more like a commodity. Reliable and quality power need to be ensured to meet customer requirements. In such a situation, it is extremely important that transmission line faults be identified accurately, reliably and in quick time. Advanced signal processing tools such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be used very effectively for parameterisation and characterization of the fault signals. On the other hand, properly configured neural network (NN) can be utilized for classification of the faults based on the DWT signal. The present contribution uses electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) for modeling of a real transmission system and MATLAB for DWT and NN. Various types of faults have been simulated at different locations along the transmission line and an attempt has been made to correctly identify and locate the fault.
Optimizing the Transmission Line Cost of a Fault Tolerance Network to Promote Green Power Usage
 Green power is clean without pollution, such as solar and wind power. It has become a resolution to supplement the deficiency of today's high cost/danger energy resources. A challenge is to integrate these distributed resources into the power grid. The high cost and voltage drop of running long transmission lines motivate the way to minimize the length by serializing their connections to load centers. This introduces a risk that the loss of a transmission line section can disconnect multiple green power resources. Our previous study proposed an idea of a fault tolerance network, in which every power resource has at least two independent connections to the load centers. Preliminary studies showed that fault tolerance can be achieved with reasonable extra transmission line expenses. The objective of this paper is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify possible Steiner points into the network. The new network intends to further reduce the cost without compromising the reliability.
Ambiguity Cancellation for Wire Fault Location based on Cable Life Profile
 Although reflectometry is an efficient method to diagnose simple topologies (such as transmission line, Y shape network), it remains limited in the case of complex branched networks due to multipath fading of the test signal during its propagation. Generally, the knowledge of the environment in which the cable operates gives an additional idea about the fault location. The current paper proposes to introduce the cable life profile (such as environmental stress, type, age, noise, etc.) to detect and cancel diagnosis ambiguities and provide a precise location of the fault. Bayesian Network (BN) seems to be a suitable solution to offer a coherent representation of knowledge domain (reflectometry method, cable characteristics and network heterogeneity) under uncertainties (fault(s) location, systems reliability and measurement precision). In this work, a two-stages BN model for diagnosis using reflectometry in branched networks is proposed and simulation results are discussed.
First-zone distance relaying algorithm of parallel transmission lines for single-phase to ground faults
 A novel zone-one distance relaying algorithm for single phase to ground faults on parallel lines is proposed. The proposed algorithm only requires sampled current and voltage values at one end of the protected line to calculate the fault impedance. The adjacent circuit zero-sequence current can be calculated from the protected circuit zero-sequence current and without cross-connection. The algorithm can overcome the issues of overreach and under-reach. The study in this paper shows that the new algorithm has higher reliability than that of conventional distance relays with and without cross-connected zero-sequence current compensation. Therefore, the algorithm optimizes the performance of zone-one distance relaying for parallel transmission lines. The results are verified by the simulations using PSCAD software.
Improved fault location algorithm for radial distribution systems with discrete and continuous wavelet analysis
 This paper presents a novel wavelet based approach for fault location using voltage transient waveforms in power distribution systems. The proposed method includes two main stages. Firstly, the approximate location of the fault or fault section is determined using a new algorithm with discrete wavelet transform. The difference between arriving times of transient components in different measurement units is used for this purpose. The accurate location of the fault is determined in the second stage. Depending on the determined fault section, the difference between arriving times of transient components in different measurement units or the frequency content of the voltage transients are used. The time difference and frequency content are calculated using discrete and continuous wavelet transform (DWT and CWT) respectively. The proposed technique is implemented on an unbalanced 34 bus distribution system with two distributed generation units which is simulated in ATP–EMTP. The comparison of the results of the proposed method with previous works verifies its better accuracy and more robustness to fault conditions including fault inception angle and fault resistance.
A real time fault analysis tool for monitoring operation of transmission line protective relay
 This paper proposes an integrated real time fault analysis tool for transmission line. The two primary techniques used in the fault analysis tool, fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network and synchronized sampling, can offer accurate fault detection, classification, internal/external fault differentiation, and fault location. The paper makes several extensions of the two techniques so that they can fit well in the realistic situations. The hardware configuration and software implementation are proposed in the paper. A comprehensive evaluation study is implemented to compare the proposed fault analysis tool with the traditional distance relay. Simulation results indicate that the integration exemplifies the advantages of both techniques and that the integrated solution has much better performance in different system conditions compared to distance relay. Both dependability and security of transmission line protection system are improved by using the proposed tool.
Fault diagnosis system for tapped power transmission lines
 This paper presents a design for a fault diagnosis system (FDS) for tapped HV/EHV power transmission lines. These lines have two different protection zones. The proposed approach reduces the cost and the complexity of the FDS for these types of lines. The FDS consists basically of fifteen artificial neural networks (ANNs). The FDS basic objectives are mainly: (1) the detection of the system fault; (2) the localization of the faulted zone; (3) the classification of the fault type; and finally (4) the identification of the faulted phase. This FDS is structured in a three hierarchical levels. In the first level, a preprocessing unit to the input data is performed. An ANN, in the second level, is designed in order to detect and zone localize the line faults. In the third level, two zone diagnosis systems (ZDS) are designed. Each ZDS is dedicated to one zone and consists of seven parallel-cascaded ANN's. Four-parallel ANN's are designed in order to achieve the fault type classification. While, the other three cascaded ANN's are designed mainly for the selection of the faulted phase. A smoothing unit is also configured to smooth out the output response of the proposed FDS. The proposed FDS is designed and evaluated using the local measurements of the three-phase voltage and current samples acquired at only one side. The sampling rate was taken 16 samples per cycle of the power frequency. Data window of 4 samples was utilized. These samples were generated using the EMTP simulation program, applied to the High-Dam/Cairo 500 kV tapped transmission line. All possible shunt fault types were considered. The effect of fault location and fault incipience time were also included. Moreover, the effect of load and capacitor switchings on the FDS performance was investigated. Testing results have proved the capability as well as the effectiveness of the proposed FDS.
An overview of modeling the stacking faults in lightweight and high-entropy alloys: Theory and application
 Modeling stacking faults in lightweight and medium- to high-entropy alloys is an exciting and fast developing field. Stacking faults and associated defects play a key role in understanding and modeling mechanical properties of alloys. We review the recent the studies of stacking faults, dislocations and twins in the novel alloys. Although this Review is focused on the theories and their applications in modeling stacking faults, relevant experimental progresses are also discussed. The Review starts with a brief introduction for the significance of stacking faults. The theoretical methods to calculate (generalized) stacking faults are then summarized and new developments of the methods are formulated. In the framework of thermodynamics, we discuss the factors that affect stacking fault energies with latest examples. Important applications of the (generalized) stacking fault method in lightweight and high-entropy alloys are demonstrated in details with research by us and other researchers. Last but not least, some generalizations of the generalized stacking fault method are discussed, among which is our new method to search possible twin boundaries. We conclude that many of these methods developed for the conventional alloys are ready for future applications in the medium- and high-entropy alloys as well.
Effects of VSC based HVDC system on distance protection of transmission lines
 The priority to reactive power contribution from the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connection to support the grid during faults as suggested by the modern Network Code (NC) for HVDC affects the distance protection of transmission lines. Moreover, suppressing the negative sequence current during an unbalanced condition also interferes with the proper operation of the distance relays. This is because the current contribution from the converter is limited in magnitude and modified in the waveform in order to protect the power electronic devices during the fault in comparison to the synchronous generator fault current characteristics. This paper discusses the cause as well as the severity of the problems faced by the distance protection of transmission lines connected to the VSC based HVDC system by analyzing the apparent impedance analytically and in the simulation. The response of the relay to balanced and unbalanced faults lying on transmission lines is investigated. It is shown that the VSC limited reactive support and suppressed negative sequence current affect fault detection, forcing the relay to malfunction. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for understanding the effects of VSC-HVDC system on the operation of the distance protection during faults.
Fault-tolerant location of transient voltage disturbance source for DG integrated smart grid
 In this paper, a new fault-tolerant approach based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed to automatically locate the transient voltage disturbance source (TVDS) for smart grid with distributed generation (DG) integration. We first analyze the influence of the DG integration on the TVDS direction-judgments. Two new credibility indexes, the monitoring-credibility and the partial-credibility, are defined to measure the reliability of direction-judgment result at each power quality monitor (PQM) with consideration of multiple factors, including DG integration, disturbance intensity and fluctuation characteristic. By using these credibility indexes and a newly defined search space, a heuristic searching approach, called IPSO, is then proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the TVDS location. Simulation study is carried out on the IEEE 34 node test feeder, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significantly improved fault-tolerant capability with satisfatory convergence speed.
Fault location based on single terminal travelling wave analysis in radial distribution network
 Fault location remains a challenging problem in order to restore power supply rapidly. In this paper, a novel single-terminal traveling wave fault location procedure is proposed in a radial distribution network. Firstly, the propagating speed of zero mode traveling wave is determined by BP neutral network method. Then the preliminary estimation of fault distance is calculated based on the difference of velocities by discriminating the accurate timestamps of initial zero and aerial mode wave fronts. With this preliminary fault distance, the exact arrival timestamps of reflected wave fronts from fault position and far terminal end can be successful yielded. Finally, depended on mathematical relation of selected pairs-timestamps, the fault distance can be calculated precisely. Simulations have performed in PSCAD/EMTDC and the results show the accuracy and validity of procedures proposed above.
A survey of fault tolerance in cloud computing
 Cloud computing has brought about a transformation in the delivery model of information technology from a product to a service. It has enabled the availability of various software, platforms and infrastructural resources as scalable services on demand over the internet. However, the performance of cloud computing services is hampered due to their inherent vulnerability to failures owing to the scale at which they operate. It is possible to utilize cloud computing services to their maximum potential only if the performance related issues of reliability, availability, and throughput are handled effectively by cloud service providers. Therefore, fault tolerance becomes a critical requirement for achieving high performance in cloud computing. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of fault tolerance-related issues in cloud computing; emphasizing upon the significant concepts, architectural details, and the state-of-art techniques and methods. The objective is to provide insights into the existing fault tolerance approaches as well as challenges yet required to be overcome.

A new method for non-unit protection of power transmission lines based on fault resistance and fault angle reduction
 In the paper, a new non-unit transient protection method suitable for single-phase faults of EHV power transmission lines was proposed based on the analysis of the propagation characteristics induced by fault transient current, the transition resistance and the fault angle on corresponding energy values of high-frequency transient current in extra high voltage (EHV) network. In the procedure, the transient current energy values from both sides of the bus were primarily normalized on the basis of transition resistance and fault angle, and then the characteristic value with functions of direction judge and value comparison was obtained by calculating their difference. By utilizing the characteristic value, the methodology came into being, by which the impacts of both transition resistance and fault angle were eliminated. The overall design has a high reliability level and owns twice the scope of the conventional protection. Simulations were performed and analyzed upon a three-phase 500 kV power system by utilizing ATP/EMTP, with various kinds of typical faults being taken into account. Plenty of results verify the feasibility of the algorithm for ultra-high speed protection of EHV power transmission lines.
Smart wireless sensor networks for online faults diagnosis in induction machine
 Online induction machine faults diagnosis is a concern to guarantee the overall production process efficiency. Nowadays, the industry demands the integration of smart wireless sensors networks (WSN) to improve the fault detection in order to reduce cost, maintenance and power consumption. Induction motors can develop one or more faults at the same time that can produce sever damages. The origin of most recurrent faults in rotary machines is in the components: stator, rotor, bearing and others. This work presents a novel methodology for the online faults diagnosis in induction motors. This technique uses the smart WSN to obtain the machine condition based on the motor stator current analysis. The implementation of the proposed smart sensor methodology allows the system to perform online fault detection in a fully automated way.

It provides detailed analysis to address challenges in designing and deploying WSNs in industrial environments, and its reliability.
A new spectral domain approach to the distance protection, fault location and arcing faults recognition on transmission lines
 In this paper, a novel two-stage numerical algorithm devoted to fault distance calculation and arcing faults recognition is presented. The first algorithm stage serves for the fault distance calculation. Fault distance is calculated from the fundamental frequency phase voltages and currents phasors, utilizing the positive- and zero-sequence impedance of the line as an input parameter. The second algorithm stage serves for the arc-voltage amplitude calculation. It utilizes the fault distance obtained from the first algorithm stage and the third harmonics of the terminal phase voltages and line currents phasors as input parameters. From the calculated value of arc-voltage amplitude it can be concluded if the fault is transient arcing fault or permanent arcless fault. The phasors needed for algorithm development are calculated by using Discrete Fourier Technique. In the paper the solution for the most frequent phase-to-ground faults is given. The results of algorithm testing through computer simulation and real field record are given.
Traveling wave protection based on asynchronously sampled time difference of arrival of modulus traveling waves in per unit line length
 Traditional traveling wave protection schemes are susceptible to many factors such as network topology change, environment interference and inaccurate identification of wave fronts, which may lead to mal-operation of protection. In addition, most traveling wave protection schemes need accurate synchronous measurement which adds to the implementation cost. This paper proposes a traveling wave protection for high voltage power grids based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of zero-mode and aerial-mode traveling wave. First, the time difference of arrival of the modulus voltage traveling waves (MVTWs) asynchronously sampled at each bus is captured. With the minimum TDOA, the key bus and fault area can be firstly determined. Then, the TDOA of the line in per unit length is defined as the ratio between the difference of the TDOAs at both terminal buses and line length. Finally, as for one case that key bus connects with no other bus, the line corresponding to the minimum TDOA of all the lines in the fault area is determined as the fault line. As for the other case, the calculated line length should be compared with the actual one to detect the fault line. PSCAD/EMTDC is used to conduct fault simulations and the calculation results verify that the proposed scheme is not affected by fault resistances, inception angles and distances. In addition, the operation time of the scheme does not exceed 20 ms, which makes it applicable for actual power grid protection.
High impedance fault detection: A review
 Protection from the high impedance fault (HIF) has been one of the biggest challenges in the power distribution network. HIF typically occurs when the conductors in distribution network break and touch the ground surface; or lean and touch a tree branch. This fault, with current magnitude close to the load current level, is not detectable by over-current relays. This paper aims to review the literature related to the HIF phenomenon. In this work, the HIF detection techniques are categorized, evaluated, and compared with one another. Furthermore, the existing HIF models and HIF location techniques are reviewed. Finally, the shortcoming of the existing perspective toward the HIF phenomenon and the possible road to the future for HIF detection is discussed.
Wavelet entropy based algorithm for fault detection and classification in FACTS compensated transmission line
 Distance protection of transmission lines including advanced flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices has been a very challenging task. FACTS devices of interest in this paper are static synchronous series compensators (SSSC) and unified power flow controller (UPFC). In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to detect and classify the fault and identify the fault position in a transmission line with respect to a FACTS device placed in the midpoint of the transmission line. Discrete wavelet transformation and wavelet entropy calculations are used to analyze during fault current and voltage signals of the compensated transmission line. The proposed algorithm is very simple and accurate in fault detection and classification. A variety of fault cases and simulation results are introduced to show the effectiveness of such algorithm.
Time domain complete protection scheme for parallel transmission lines
 In this paper, time domain relaying schemes for complete protection of parallel transmission lines using wavelet and artificial neural network (ANN) are presented. Four different ANN networks are designed for detection of the fault, fault section identification, classification of fault and location of fault in time domain. The 3rd level approximate discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients of signals of one end are used as input to ANN network. Proposed method is tested with varying fault location, inception angle, fault type and fault resistance. The test results show that the fault is detected and located within 5 ms time accurately. This scheme offers primary protection as well as backup protection to the lines.

Firstly, the required early warning area is divided into grids according to the corresponding typhoon prediction information. Secondly, the probability distribution functions of design wind load and actual wind load are fitted by normal distribution and extremeⅠdistribution function respectively, and the damage probability of overhead transmission line is calculated based on the stress intensity interference model. Thirdly,the interval of warning time is chosen referring to the typhoon detective line of 24 and 48 h, and the reasonable warning output is given. Finally, an example is provided using the data from typhoon "Mujigae" in 2015 and Guangdong province to validate the effectiveness and scientificity of the method proposed in this paper.
Stochastic modeling of power system faults
 Correct modeling of power system faults is a key issue in a diversity of power system studies, such as in network planning, equipment specification and protection systems coordination. The present paper addresses the probabilistic description of faults, based on available data collected by transmission system operators for different voltage levels. Fault rate and individual fault characteristics are stochastically modeled, namely fault location, type and resistance. A fault resistance model is suggested, based on Weibull distribution, which parameters are set per voltage level. The proposed fault description is a useful tool for power system planning and design, when a stochastic approach of the power system faults characteristics is adopted. Time series of fault input data and simulation results are presented in a common format, so to allow using the same statistical tools as used in power system monitoring and field data reporting. The model is able to reproduce atypical years, as happen in real transmission networks. The developed fault model is used to generate stochastic short-circuit events, which are then used for short-circuit current computation. The methodology is applied to the IEEE RTS and simulation results are shown for the probability of amplitude and time constant values. These results are prone to be used to specify network circuit breakers and current transformers using a probabilistic approach.
New ANN method for multi-terminal HVDC protection relaying
 This paper proposes a comprehensive novel multi-terminal HVDC protection scheme based on artificial neural network (ANN) and high frequency components detected from fault current signals only. The method is shown to accurately detect, classify and locate overhead line faults. Unlike existing travelling wave based methods which must capture the initial wavefront and require high sampling rates, the new approach is more robust since it gives accurate fault detection and fault location over a range of windowed post-fault signals. Furthermore, the proposed method is fault resistance independent meaning even a very high fault impedance has no effect on accurate fault location. A three-terminal VSC-HVDC system is modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC, which is used for obtaining the fault current data for transmission line terminals. The method is verified by studying different cases with a range of fault resistances in various fault locations, and in addition, external faults. The results show that the proposed method gives fast (<5 ms) and reliable (100%) fault detection and classification and accurate location (<1.16%) for DC line faults.
A non-unit line protection scheme for MMC-based multi-terminal HVDC grid
 Multi-terminal flexible HVDC grids are required due to the high penetration of renewable energy. However, they are vulnerable to dc faults. To ensure their high reliability and continuous operation, fast and selective protection schemes are indispensable. This paper analyses the transient voltages in the case of dc line faults in modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC grid. Then, making use of the boundary effect of current-limiting reactors, a fast non-unit dc line protection scheme based on fault transient voltage is proposed. In addition, the faulty pole identification criterion is constructed based on fault currents. A MMC-based four-terminal HVDC grid is modelled using PSCAD/EMTDC, and extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed protection method not only can detect faults rapidly and accurately, but is also effective in detecting large-resistance faults.
Wide area backup protection algorithm for transmission lines based on fault component complex power
 In this paper a new wide area backup protection algorithm based on the fault component complex power is proposed to overcome the problem of maloperation of conventional backup protection in highly stressed conditions of power system operation. Firstly, suspected faulty lines are detected using measured values of fault component voltages known as faulted area identification (FAI) criteria. Then, the fault component voltages and currents provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs) are applied to calculate the injected complex power to both terminals of the suspected faulty lines. The ratio between sum and difference of injected complex power to the both terminals of the suspected faulty lines is used as faulted line identification (FLI) criteria. The simulation studies performed on the IEEE 10 generator 39-bus system verify effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under various conditions and fault types.
Resistance varying characteristics of DC superconducting fault current limiter in MTDC system
 Recent years, voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage DC power transmission (MTDC) is widely developed in the world. However, it is difficult for the existing DC breaker to cut off the fault transmission line with large short-circuit fault current. Then, it would be helpful to develop DC fault current limiter for the MTDC system. In this paper, DC superconducting fault current limiter (DCSFCL) is proposed to limit fault current. In order to study the resistance-time performance of the DCSFCL under the rapid change of fault current, a simulation model of Zhoushan MTDC system with DCSFCL is established, and the current-limiting performance of the DCSFCL at different location of the grid is studied. The simulation results show that DCSFCL can effectively limit short-circuit current and improve the operation reliability of MTDC system.
Indoor localization strategy based on fault-tolerant area division for shipboard surveillance
 Localization based on wireless sensor networks has been shown to be a promising application in ships. Although a considerable number of algorithms have been designed for low-overhead and high-accuracy localization, some problems have been ignored, such as interference in the shipboard environment and the method of using anchor-deploying. In this paper, we present a method for range-free localization called fault-tolerant area division (FAD) to deploy and divide the area in which precise indoor localization is required. Despite the limitations with respect to shipboard environmental interference, sensing irregularity, received signal strength variation, and other unavoidable factors, FAD has been shown to be reliable by improving the fault-tolerant mechanism. In addition, to address the scheme of anchor-node placement, which complicates the localization performance, this paper presents a new deployment strategy for the anchor nodes using optimization methods. This paper presents and analyzes an enhancement method using a series of simulations and real-world ship experiments. The result shows that a well-organized deployment and a fault-tolerant mechanism can make such localization method more reliable and compatible.
A comprehensive framework for seismic risk assessment of urban water transmission networks
 Earthquakes are natural disasters which human beings cannot control, causing significant damage to the economy and society as a whole. In particular, earthquakes affect not only buildings but also lifeline structures such as water distribution, electric power, transportation, and telecommunication networks. The interruption of these networks is critical because it can directly damage the facilities and, at the same time, cause long-term loss of the overall system for society. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the uncertainties of ground motion, deterioration of pipelines, and interdependency of lifelines. Therefore, it is essential to predict the damage through possible earthquake scenarios and accounting for factors affecting lifeline structures. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to quantify the impact of earthquakes on the connectivity of urban water transmissions. The framework proposes the following steps to predict damage from earthquakes: (1) estimate the ground motion considering the spatial correlation, (2) propose a modified failure probability of buried pipelines considering deterioration, and (3) evaluate the seismic fragility curves of network components and the interdependency among water treatment plants, pumping plants, and substations. For numerical simulations, an actual water network system in South Korea was constructed using graph theory, and the magnitudes and locations of the epicenters were determined based on historical earthquake data. Finally, the reliability performance indicators (e.g., connectivity loss and serviceability ratio) were measured when earthquakes of various magnitudes occurred in the urban area. This framework will enable the prediction of damage from earthquakes and enhance decision making to minimize the extent of damage.

 A performance analysis methodology for transmission line primary protection systems is presented, based on a probabilistic approach to protection system successful operation. The protection system operation is represented by reliability graphs, and a probabilistic model of the distance protection is considered. The system successful operation is described by tie-sets, and solutions are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. The system elements are characterized by the reliability factors: equipment failure rate and time to repair. The system performance is assessed by the availability index. The developed methodology is applied to a transmission line protection scheme with one aided communication channel. Results allow quantifying the influence of the fault location on the protection system performance. Results also show the influence of the equipment failure rate on the system performance. The developed methodology proves to be adequate to quantify the benefits of using communication channels in transmission line protection. Furthermore it is adequate to assess different protection system architectures. A comparative performance analysis, considering four different transmission line protection schemes, can be found in the Part II paper.
Arcing fault identification using combined Gabor Transform-neural network for transmission lines
 This paper presents an intelligent identification scheme for transient faults in transmission systems using Gabor Transform (GT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The successful discrimination between arcing and permanent faults can be then utilized for realize a reliable operation of autoreclosure systems. The proposed algorithm employs the GT as a signal processing technique and the ANN for pattern recognition and classification processes. The use of GT is motivated by the fact that the Gabor elementary functions have distinctive an optimal localization property in the joint time and frequency domains, which leads to an optimal feature extraction. The extracted GT coefficients are used as the inputs to a three layer feedforward ANN. The generalization capabilities of neural networks together with the GT are expected to discriminate between arcing and permanent fault cases successfully. The fault behavior is simulated by ATP/EMTP where the arc model is realized using universal arc representation. Finally, the possibility of hardware implementation of the proposed scheme is visualized in order to verify its practicality and suitability for real field operation. The results show that combining of GT along with ANNs achieves an excellent performance to discriminate between arcing and permanent faults with eliminating the impacts of fault resistance, fault location and fault inception angle as compared with conventional discriminators.
Ultra-high-speed protection of transmission lines using traveling wave theory
 A new traveling-wave-based algorithm is proposed in this paper for the protection of transmission lines. In the proposed algorithm, Teager energy operator is used to extract traveling waves. Teager energy operator has a high computational efficiency and extracts traveling waves with high resolution. The amplitude of the first detected traveling wave as well as that of the traveling waves which are detected in 2L/v and 2(L − x)/v seconds (“L” is the line length, x is an initial guess about the fault location, and “v” is the traveling wave propagation speed) after the first one are used to discriminate internal and external faults. Then the traveling wave propagation speed and the time difference between the first and the second traveling waves are used to find the fault location. This process can also be used for the internal fault identification. Finally, two decision trees and the amplitude of initial current traveling waves in different modes are used for the fault type classification and faulted phase selection. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is investigated by test signals which are simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.
Accurate fault location on EHV lines using both RBF based support vector machine and SCALCG based neural network
 An appropriate method for fault location on Extra High Voltage (EHV) transmission line using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed in this paper. It relies on the application of SVM and frequency characteristics of the measured single end positive sequence voltage and current measurement of transient signals of the system. This paper is proposing a new hybrid approach for fault location on EHV lines using Radial Basis Function (RBF) basis SVM and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCALCG) basis neural network method. Sample inputs are determined by MATLAB. The average error of fault location in 400 kV and 150 km line is tested and the results prove that the proposed method is effective and reduce the error within a short duration of time using both RBF based SVM and SCALCG based neural network.
A noncommunication adaptive single phase auto-reclosure of transmission lines using phase space based criteria
 This paper presents two phase space (PS) based criteria, and then on the basis of which it illustrates the preparation of a new non-intelligent and noncommunication adaptive single phase auto-reclosure (ASPAR) scheme to detect the secondary arc extinction for reclosure of transmission lines after self-clearing of transient faults. This scheme, which is fed by local voltage signal, can accurately distinguish between transient and permanent faults in transmission lines. Moreover, in the case of transient faults, the secondary arc extinction can be detected by the proposed algorithm within 8 ms and under effective operational and structural conditions, including different fault locations, load amounts, number of circuits, ideally transposed, partially transposed and un-transposed circuits, existence of shunt reactors and measurement noise. Besides, the presented PS based algorithm can be implemented sample by sample and does not need complicated integral computation, which connotes that it can be embedded in reclosing relays in transmission systems.
Adaptive single-phase auto-reclosing method using power line carrier signals
 This paper proposes a new method for adaptive single-phase auto-reclosing (ASPAR) that improves the rate of successful reclosing actions after the occurrence of a transient single-phase fault and prevents unsuccessful reclosing. After the occurrence of a fault, the only faulty phase is disconnected by the protection system (e.g., distance relays and circuit breakers). The proposed method deploys power line carrier (PLC) signals for determination of the secondary arc extinction time and releasing the reclosing signals to the circuit breakers. Despite the growing use of new communication systems (e.g., fibre-optic links), PLC systems are still widely used, and may not be considered for replacement in near future. Therefore, the proposed method can be utilized as an auxiliary application of PLC systems to enhance the resiliency of power grids. The simulation studies are carried out using EMTP-RV and MATLAB, and the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method are discussed and compared with the existing ASPAR methods. According to the simulation results, the efficiency of the proposed ASPAR method is negligibly influenced by the following factors: fault location, faulty phase, system loading, transmission line transposition, shunt reactor, PLC carrier frequency, PLC operating mode, and the noises.
Adaptive ground distance protection for UPFC compensated transmission lines: A formulation considering the fault resistance effect
 This paper presents a mathematical deterministic adaptive distance protection formulation for UPFC compensated transmission lines. The proposed formulation is developed using a phase component approach and considers and compensates for various UPFC operation conditions and non-zero fault resistances. The proposed methodology is completely adaptive and independent of system characteristics (such as changes in transmission line impedances) or operating conditions (such as different load conditions and controlled reference parameters). Moreover, the proposed formulation uses local and remote end voltage and current signals as input data. The comparative test results demonstrate potential beneficial aspects of the proposed formulation for real-time applications.
A realistic dynamic model for gear fault diagnosis
 A reliable dynamic model that predicts the vibrations of a gear transmission containing a fault may allow us to recognize the effects of that fault, to identify its severity, and to develop methods for characterizing its type by using a limited number of experiments. In this research, a new generic model for gear dynamics is proposed. This model is solved numerically, and combines the most advanced approaches for gear modeling, including: modeling the contact between gear pairs as a set of springs, modeling the effect of faults on the mesh stiffness, and integrating the geometric errors. As a result, the model simulates successfully the acceleration signal of a realistic gear pair in a realistic environment. In this paper, we present a different approach to simulate partial tooth face faults, which takes into account the partial contact loss along the tooth contact line due to the fault's geometry. We propose a new analytical formulation for modeling complete tooth face faults that are located across the entire contact area. Additionally, a modified analytical expression for describing the tooth profile errors is proposed. Using a realistic simulation, we were able to experimentally validate the model.
Fast fault detection scheme for series-compensated lines during power swing
 This paper reports the use of a novel ultra-high speed scheme to release the distance relay to operate for a fault during a power swing in the series compensated line. In the scheme, in order to extract the fault induced voltage and current components, voltage and current samples are analyzed by the multi-resolution morphological gradient (MMG), first. Then, the fault initiated forward travelling wave is computed at the distance relay point. Next, Likelihood ratio [LR] test is utilized to detect a jump in the statistical mean of the calculated forward travelling wave. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to distinguish faults from other normal capacitor and switching transients. It is shown that in all of the simulated cases, our ultra-high speed algorithm was successful in fault detection across a wide range conditions including, fault type, fault resistance, fault location, pre-fault loading and fault inception time. Moreover, we found that using the proposed scheme significantly speeded the fault detection, in comparison with the existing phasor based methods. In addition, the improvements noted in our algorithm are achieved with a low computational burden.

 This paper proposes a new high fault coverage test approach for short faults in Network on Chip communication channels. The proposed approach consists of a built in self-test as well as a Packet/flit Comparing Module (PCM) embedded in the network adapter and a router, respectively. The approach is mainly characterized by the fact that, the detection, location, and routing table updating processes are simultaneously carried out after which the test time is minimized. The approach with high scalability leads to 100% test coverage and 89.5% capability of diagnosing faulty channels in one round (two phases). The simulation results show that the approach hardware and time cost is optimized compared with the previous methodologies.
Faults Monitoring System in the Electric Power Grid of Medium Voltage
 In electric power to medium voltage one of the service quality factors is to ensure the continuous supply of electricity to the customer. This work aims to develop a fault monitoring system based only in one variable: the electric current. The purpose is to develop a flexible and scalable system so that any electrical grid that can identify the cause and location of the failure in the medium voltage of electric power grid, contributing to improve the service quality of the grid. Also, the system can be easily adapted to monitor environmental parameters to generate alerts on natural catastrophes. The neutral system that is implemented (grounded, impedance grounded or ungrounded) is an important factor, in this work the ungrounded system is evaluated. In this paper three different algorithms have been developed: System A, system B and C. System A monitors the nominal value of electric current in each line of the electric power grid, system B monitors the value of electric power in each transformer station and system C compares the current at the begin and end of each line of the grid, checking if there is any discrepancy between them. All algorithms were tested in simulation mode and the most flexible, system C, was implemented in laboratorial prototype. It has been verified that for evaluating the monitoring system it is necessary to analyze the following parameters: real-time fault detection and location, monitoring before the distribution line protections act and the ability to adapt according to changes in the electric power grid, improving the service quality.

 This paper presents a wavelets and support vector regression (SVR) based method for locating grounded faults in radial distribution systems. The method utilizes traveling wave data recorded at the substation only. After modal transformation on three-phase traveling waves, the arrival time and amplitude information of modal components are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In particular, time delay and ratio between the first Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) of modal components in each scale are the candidate features for training a SVR which will be used for fault distance prediction. The simulation and SVR process are performed respectively using PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB. The result shows the method has high accuracy and good stability.

 This paper presents a model-based methodology of residuals design for fault diagnosis of an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) shifting actuator by employing Structural Analysis (SA). A group of sensors are suggested to obtain the maximal capability of Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) after performing SA. Then, Minimal Structurally Over-determined (MSO) sets are identified to generate four residuals. To ensure stable and robust residuals, concepts from Analytical Redundant Relation (ARR) and observer-based parameter evaluation techniques are utilized. The proposed FDI scheme for AMT actuator has been successfully tested and verified using numerical simulations in MATLAB Simulink. The presented scheme offers a cost effective solution by using only two sensors to monitor five critical faults in AMT actuator.
A new fault location algorithm for radial distribution systems using modal analysis
 In this paper, an accurate and efficient method is proposed for fault section estimation and fault distance calculation in distribution systems, based on frequency spectrum components of fault generated traveling waves. Fault occurrence in a radial distribution system generates high frequency traveling waves that can be divided into two parts. Part of them travels between fault location and substation and the other part is reflected between network junctions and substation. By identification of these two parts, the proposed algorithm determines faulted section and exact distance of fault from substation uniquely. Consequently, the main drawback of the impedance based methods which is the multiple-estimation problem is removed. In the proposed method, it is assumed that just one voltage recorder is installed at the distribution substation and additional equipments such as, fault indicators and PQ monitoring devices are also not needed to be installed in the distribution system. The simulations are carried out using ATP software and the results are processed by MATLAB software. Simulation results of various types of faults on a typical distribution system demonstrate high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. Effect of different influential parameters such as fault inception angle, fault resistance and load variations has also been taken into account.
Realistic insights into impedance seen by distance relays of a SSSC-compensated transmission line incorporating shunt capacitance of line
 In practice, the series compensation is applied to medium-/long-length transmission lines. Such lines include significant shunt capacitance, neglecting of which is expected to noticeably influence the impedance seen by distance relays. Taking the shunt capacitance of a transmission line compensated by the static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) as well as other affecting factors into account, this paper derives precise mathematical expressions governing the apparent impedance seen by the distance relay of the line. Through the acquired expressions, the research conducts sensitivity studies considering different compensation scenarios and locations for the SSSC. The studies make an attempt to produce realistic insights into ideal tripping characteristics of the distance protection of the under studied line, and also into the susceptibility of the impedance seen to output parameters of the SSSC. In addition, the research’s findings well demonstrate the extent to which neglecting the shunt capacitance of the line would contribute to mis-operation of the distance relay.
Helical fault diagnosis model based on data-driven incremental mergence
 With the improving capability for acquiring real-time data in the field of intelligent manufacturing, the data-driven machine learning approach has been an effective means for equipment fault diagnosis. Although incremental learning can make up for the shortcoming of machine learning that newly generated data must be combined with the original data for retraining, it cannot be carried out directly and effectively in the face of problems caused by fault data streams of massive-volume, imbalance, strong noise, and strong causality. In this paper, a helical fault diagnosis model based on data-driven incremental mergence is proposed to tackle this problem. Each helical cycle includes four procedures to handle incremental data blocks for imbalanced data processing, feature extraction and classification, effective example selection, and dynamic evaluation of features and examples. The effective features and examples are then transmitted to the next helical cycle to merge for preserving the fault information. The experimental results of bearing operation data demonstrate that the proposed model could efficiently solve the problem of incremental learning with massive and imbalanced fault data, significantly improve the recognition rate of minority faults, and reduce the time cost, thus contributing to meeting the specific requirements of equipment fault data.
Fault localization using dual pulse widths for PON monitoring system
 We propose a novel method using dual pulse widths to locate the fiber break, which can share the pulse detecting source with the previous proposed passive optical network (PON) monitoring systems. The rectangular detecting pulses with two different pulse widths are sequentially injected into the faulty fiber link to generate corresponding parameters for the established model equations. We also investigate the corresponding variables (i.e., different combinations of dual pulse widths, pulse repetition frequency and accuracy of the power meter) that may affect the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the fiber breakpoint can be located with little error. The simple and low-cost method provides a fault localization functionality for the PON monitoring systems.
A low-cost high-speed self-checking carry select adder with multiple-fault detection
 Employing cost-efficient, high-speed and fault-tolerant processing units is an essential goal in the design of current processors. In this paper, the carry select adder (CSeA) as one of the fastest adders is augmented respecting multiple-fault detection, delay, power and required area. In this way, based on the concept of a self-checking full adder, an m-bit logic-optimized self-checking single-stage CSeA is designed in which at most m concurrent faults can be detected. Then, based on a delay analysis, a new grouping structure for the self-checking multi-stage CSeA apart from the conventional square-root (SQRT) grouping is proposed to optimize the overall delay for different adder sizes. The proposed grouping structure decreases the power overhead, as well. Experimental results show that as well as an acceptable multiple-fault detection capability, noticeable improvements are achieved in delay and power consumption compared to the previous self-checking CSeA designs. The proposed CSeA reaches in average 20% power reduction and 34% speed improvement in different sizes compared to the best existing design.
An algorithm for estimating fault location in an unbalanced three-phase power system
 A new algorithm for estimating fault location on a transmission line, as well as the fault type, is studied and tested using simulation data obtained from the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP). The proposed algorithm is based on the least absolute value estimation approach (LAV), and uses digitized samples of post-fault voltage and current waveforms at the relay locations. The proposed algorithm is applied to two different models of the transmission line. The first model is a three phase long transmission line, while the second model is a three phase three terminals transmission line. The measurements taken at the relay location do not need to be synchronized. Effects of critical parameters on the behavior of the proposed algorithm and on the estimated fault location are examined. A computational comparison between the proposed algorithm and the least errors square (LES) is presented in the paper.
A new approach of fast fault detection in HV-B transmission lines based on Detail Spectrum Energy analysis using oscillographic data
 The main focus of this research is to develop an accurate real-time method for fault detection and analysis of HVB (High Voltage Class-B) transmission lines. The current and voltage signals of oscillographic records are acquired by the distance protections relays with minimum impedance GE D60-1 installed in the electrical network of SONELGAZ (Algerian Company of Electricity and GAS). This method deals on the evaluation of the Detail Spectrum Energy (DSE) calculated from the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) applied on the current phases by moving data windows with length equivalent to one cycle of the fundamental power frequency. The fault detection algorithm is processed at first scale superimposed in the fault current signals (phases and ground) by the sharp variation of (DSE). Most of the existing methods treat the disturbances and faults simultaneously exist in transmission line as a single type. The proposed method has the ability to discriminate between the disturbances and the faults. This study is compared with the “Powerful Analysis of all Protection Fault Records” SIGRA software for determining the start fault inception and it’s clearing time. The performance of this method was tested and evaluated on a real data records and can accurately detect the fault within only half a cycle from the instant of fault occurrence.
Fault Monitoring and Accommodation of the Heat Exchanger Parameters of Triga-Mark II Nuclear Research Reactor using Model-Based Analytical Redundancy
 One of the major challenges in instrumentation is to identify wrong data (signal) measurements and perform their validation. This can be done by regularly ensuring a correct operation of the different process components, particularly those having great importance for safety, in order to detect, isolate and identify any possible degradation or fault. This operation, known as on-line fault monitoring, should be done as early as possible, before any fault causes failure in equipment which can lead to the downtime of the plant and even to severe catastrophes and disasters. Therefore, these consequences influence negatively on productivity, availability and environment. At Triga-Mark II nuclear research reactor, the heat exchangers are provided for removing generated heat from the reactor pool water throw cooling circuits. Therefore, the monitoring of the evolution of certain thermo hydraulic parameters is necessary to ensure the safety of the reactor. Among several developed techniques, analytical redundancy has been recognized as an effective method for fault monitoring. It is the process of identifying a faulty instrument in a system through a comparison of its output to an estimate data. This estimation is based on the model and the measurements provided by the data acquisition chains of the existing sensors during all the operating modes of the installation. In our case, we are limited to mathematical models and Kalman filter approaches. In this paper we review the state of the fault monitoring and some model based analytical redundancy techniques for the heat exchanger, and present experimental results on their application to temperatures and flow rates of the cooling system of Triga-Mark II research reactor core.
Equivalent traveling waves based current differential protection of EHV/UHV transmission lines
 Current differential protection is one of the most important primary protections of extra/ultra-high-voltage (EHV/UHV) transmission lines. Despite its wide application, there exist major adverse factors of synchronization misalignment, current transformer (CT) saturation and line capacitive charging current, which may lead to a mal-operation. To solve these problems, a new current differential protection method, based on the concept of equivalent traveling wave (ETW), is proposed. The protection method is immune to CT saturation and line capacitive charging current, operates at an ultra-high speed, and does not require synchronized sampling. In the protection method, wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) are used to reconstruct the current ETWs and thus reduce the communication traffic to an appropriate level. The reconstructed ETWs are then used to establish the percentage restraint operation criterion. Besides, a blocking method is implemented to avoid possible mal-operation when an external fault occurs on a line that forms a parallel path but has no mutual coupling with the protected line. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed protection method can serve as a secure and reliable primary protection for non-, shunt-, or series-compensated transmission lines with high sensitivity, even on internal high-resistance faults.
Location of faults in power distribution laterals using superimposed components and programmable logic controllers
 In this study, a digital fault location and monitoring technique using programmable logic controller (PLC) for primary overhead power distribution networks is presented. This technique employs pre- and post-fault current and voltage information along with data from the laterals. By using lateral current data transferred through shielded coaxial cables to the substation, the possibility of multiple fault point locations are eliminated. The effectiveness of this method is verified through Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) simulations.
An intelligent fault detection and classification scheme for distribution lines integrated with distributed generators
 Conventional relays fail to detect the high impedance fault (HIF) in distribution lines, as the change in the current magnitude is very negligible compared to conventional relay settings. Moreover, the incorporation of distributed generators in the distribution lines changes the fault current level, which makes the HIF-detection more complex. In this paper, a fuzzy-based intelligent fault detection and classification scheme is developed for the distribution lines integrated with DGs. Two different fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are modelled in each phase to detect the fault. The first FIS identifies the high magnitude of fault current associated with normal shunt faults; and the second FIS identifies the small magnitude of current owing to occurrence of HIF. The proposed scheme uses the features extracted from the Teager energy operator. An extensive study is conducted and the response time is found to be around ¼-1 cycle. Results validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.
Controlled switching technique for minimization of switching surge during energization of uncompensated and shunt compensated transmission lines for circuit breakers having pre-insertion resistors
 Controlled Switching Device (CSD) is considered to be the replacement of Pre-Insertion Resistor (PIR). Moreover, tie Circuit Breaker (CB) used in One-and-a-Half-Breaker (OHB) scheme as well as in line connected with non-switchable reactor scheme are employed with PIR and CSD. In this paper, a new methodology has been proposed using CSD with PIR-CB for further mitigation of the switching surge during energization/re-energization of Un-compensated Transmission Line (UCTL) and Shunt reactor compensated Transmission Line (SCTL). Unlike the existing methodology (both for UCTL/SCTL) which requires line side voltage signatures, the proposed methodology does not necessitate the same for SCTL and requires only the polarity of line side voltages for UCTL. The performance of the proposed methodology has been evaluated by generating diversified cases on 400 kV UCTL and SCTL using PSCAD/EMTDC software package. The proposed switching strategy is able to mitigate the switching surge of the order of 33% for UCTL and 20% for SCTL. Comparative evaluation of the proposed methodology with usual PIR methodology clearly shows its effectiveness with reference to statistical variations of CB. The proposed methodology has been validated during effects of various parameters such as weather conditions, insulation resistance, change in closing phase sequence, and Surge Arrestor (SA).
An overview of digital fault location algorithms for power transmission lines using transient waveforms
 A digital fault location algorithm for calculating the fault distance on a power transmission line can be designed using any of three approaches: the steady-state phasor approach, the differential equation approach and the travelling-wave approach. In this paper, the algorithms utilizing the differential equation and the travelling-wave approach are reviewed. The effect of various algorithms on the relay speed and accuracy is examined. The associated filtering techniques are discussed.
A new technique for location of transmission line faults using single-terminal voltage and current data
 This paper presents a new technique for location of transmission line faults using voltage and current measurements from one end of the faulted line. The method differs from past techniques in many respects. The main feature of the new technique is that it considers the influence of the remote-end infeed of the transmission line, the effect of the transmission line capacitance, fault resistance, prefault loading conditions, and the effect of mutual coupling between different phases of the line, and then computes with a microprocessor the distance to the fault point without any approximations. It uses recorded phase voltages and currents at the near end, then the fundamental components of the measured signals are extracted using microprocessor filters. The modal values of the extracted signals are computed then processed to indicate the precise location of the fault.
Efficient network fault analysis method for unbalanced microgrid systems
 A novel network short-circuit fault analysis method based on graph theory and a complex short-circuit MVA representation is proposed as an alternative method for unbalanced microgrid systems. The proposed algorithm is based on the branch-path incidence matrix K and the newly defined augmented incidence matrix Kℓ of a power network, as opposed to the traditional Z-bus building algorithm and inverse Y-bus matrix with the lower and upper triangular matrix (LU) method. To simplify the unit transformation among different voltage levels, all network components are represented in a short-circuit MVA form with their own infinite bus. Moreover, two major types of distributed generation (DG) models have been successfully implemented using the proposed method; therefore, the contributions of DG to the fault currents can be easily addressed in a microgrid system. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is accurate and performs better than other methods, particularly with respect to large-scale unbalanced microgrid distribution systems with hybrids of single-, two-, and three-phase.
A Study on Smart Fault Locator Based on Time-Synchronized Phasor
 In order to reduce fault location estimation error, this paper deals with an enhanced fault location technique based on the improved DC offset filter. In addition, this paper presents the complete design of smart digital fault locator using GPS time-synchronized phasor. The smart fault location algorithm uses the transmitted relaying signals from the two-end terminal. The smart fault locator hardware consists of a main processor unit, analog to digital processor unit, signal interface unit, and power module. Various types of real-time test using COMTRADE format of Omicron apparatus are included.
A novel fast distance relay for series compensated transmission lines
 This paper presents a fast distance relay for series compensated transmission lines based on the R–L differential-equation algorithm using the theory of equal transfer process of transmission lines. The measuring distances based on the proposed algorithm can fast approach the actual value of fault distance when a fault occurs in front of the series capacitor. When a fault occurs behind of the series capacitor, the fault loop, including the series capacitor, does not match the R–L transmission line model, so the measuring distances fluctuate severely. Based on this, the relative position of the fault with respect to the series capacitor can be judged effectively according to the fluctuation range of the measuring distances, and the accurate fault location can be obtained fast. A variety of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation tests show that the new relay has fast operating speed and high accuracy when applied to the long series compensated transmission lines.
Subsurface faults inferred from reflection seismic, earthquakes, and sedimentological relationships: Implications for induced seismicity in Alberta, Canada
 Given the recent induced seismic activity in Alberta, identification of subsurface faults and areas of structural complexity has become increasingly important in improving our understanding of the controls on induced seismic events. Using a 3D geological model supplemented with 2D and 3D reflection seismic data, several basement-bounded and basement-rooted faults, which extend upward and into the Devonian strata, are identified in areas coincident with increased seismic activity. The presence of faults in the study area was confirmed through a statistically significant correlation of high-quality seismic event data from historical and recent (1970–2016) induced earthquakes in Alberta to the edge of the Devonian-aged Swan Hills platform. Along with the identification of faults using reflection seismic and earthquake hypocenter data, a review of the role of pre-existing structure on depositional patterns that has been previously used to infer deep structure in this area, is also presented in this study. Several pre-existing extensional and/or transtensional style faults in the deeper strata and shallow basement of the study area are consistent with structure influencing the sedimentation of the overlying stratigraphy. Therefore, a better understanding of genetic fault-reef associations and the relationship to overlying strata may aid in identification of fault locations, style, and orientation. Considering the advancement of proper avoidance strategies during the planning stages of unconventional resource development or storage, this paper demonstrates the use of geological knowledge and relationships to identify areas comprising faults that may be prone to reactivation.
Estimation of the highest potential transmissivity of discrete shear fractures using the ductility index
 Previous studies indicated that the highest potential transmissivities of fractures in fault zones might be well estimated by a mechanical indicator: the ductility index (DI). The DI is defined as the effective mean stress normalized to the tensile strength of the intact rock mass. The mechanism of formation and preservation of pore structures in fault-zone fractures can be explained by local shear-induced tensile stresses, and pore structures in discrete shear fractures may form in the same way. I investigated, therefore, whether the DI model can correctly predict the highest transmissivities of shear fractures recorded in fractured Neogene diatomaceous mudstone (Koetoi Formation), where fault zones and joints are rare but discrete shear fractures, without mineral fillings, are abundant. Analyses of the shear fractures reveal that the detected states of paleostress are nearly equal to the current stress state, implying the shear fractures have potentially been tectonically active. Thus, the highest transmissivities detected at fractures by flowing-fluids electric conductivity (FFEC) borehole logging may potentially be treated as the highest potential transmissivities in terms of the given DIs. Relationships between the transmissivities of flow anomalies and DIs fit the existing DI model well, which suggests the model is applicable to discrete shear fracture systems as well as fault zones.
Signal processing methods in fault detection in manufacturing systems
 The paper gives a short introduction to the problem of fault detection in manufacturing systems using digital signal processing methods. Usually, in manufacturing systems faults can occur in electrical drives, transmission lines, power management systems and can be detected through sensor data acquisition. Important task of the diagnosis is to differentiate normal operating condition from faulty condition. Detection of occurred faults in manufacturing systems depends on how efficiently erroneous features are extracted from acquired signals. This work focuses on signal processing based methods using Discrete Wavelet and Wavelet Packet Transforms for detection and classification the occurred faults. The faults are simulated using test signals with different time and frequency properties and the results obtained from different approaches are evaluated and compared. The simulation results prove that the proposed techniques handle the problem of fault detection and may even predict abnormalities exploring long term tendencies of the detected signals.
Fault Location and Diagnosis Algorithms for Radial Distribution Systems
 In this paper, a fault location and diagnosis algorithm is proposed. The proposed scheme first identifies fault locations using an iterative estimation of load and fault current at each line section. Then an actual location is identified applying the current pattern matching rules. If necessary, comparison of the interrupted load with the actual load follows and generates the final diagnosis decision. Effect of load uncertainty and fault resistance has been carefully investigated through simulation results, that turns out tobe very satisfactory.
A new approach to fault location in three-phase underground distribution system using combination of wavelet analysis with ANN and FLS
 This paper presents the results of investigation into a new fault classification and location technique, using EMTP software. The simulated data is then analyzed using advanced signal processing technique based on wavelet analysis to extract useful information from the signals. The artificial neural network (ANN) and the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is then used to detect the type and the location of the ground high impedance, ungrounded series, ungrounded and ground shunt faults in a practical underground distribution system (UDS). The results indicate that the fault location technique has an acceptable accuracy (error < 1.5%) under the whole variety of different systems and fault conditions. Therefore, the proposed approach can have high performance for the evaluation of the fault location and classification.
Failure risk analysis under switching surges in power transmission systems
 The insulation of the power transmission systems is exposed to stresses not only during normal operating but also by the transient overvoltages. Transient overvoltages are originated by different sources such as lightning, switching and faults. The switching surges have become dominant factor in the insulation design of Extra High Voltages and Ultra High Voltages systems. Insulation failure probability under transient surges is the main impressive concern in the studies of insulation coordination and failure risk. In this paper the failure risk of insulation under switching overvoltages generated during energization of unloaded transmission line are computed using the statistical approach. In the calculation, both the statistical characteristics of the overvoltages and statistical distribution of insulation flashover probabilities are tackled. The statistical distributions of energization overvoltages on a typical 500 kV transmission-line are derived from the results of 100 energization cases with statistical switching using Alternate Transient Program (ATP). The most important factors affecting the insulation flashover probabilities and the failure risk are demonstrated. The effects of number of towers in parallel, the switching overvoltages profile, the front time of the overvoltages waveform and the non-standard atmospheric conditions on the failure probability are investigated. Failure risk analysis is analyzed using different probability distribution schemes.
A new approach to fault location in two-terminal transmission lines using artificial neural networks
 This paper presents a new approach to fault location in two-terminal overhead transmission lines, using artificial neural networks (ANN's). The method presented enables the distance to be determined at which the fault occurs in a two-terminal transmission line using the fundamental components of 50/60 Hz of the fault and pre-fault voltage and current magnitudes, measured in each phase of the reference end. The main characteristic of the method is the consideration during the training period of both correctly measured magnitudes and magnitudes affected by errors. Using properly validated fault simulation software has checked the accuracy of the method with both correct initial data and initial data containing errors.
Electric Power Transmission
 Modern electric power system consists of complex interconnected network of components. This chapter covers the components that make up the modern power system. These include generators, transformers, and transmission line. It also focuses on the transmission of electric power, how to optimize its power transfer capability, the phenomena of over-voltages and the insulation requirement of transmission lines.
Can Fault Leakage Occur Before or Without Reactivation? Results from an in Situ Fault Reactivation Experiment at Mont Terri
 We conducted fluid injection tests in four packed-off borehole intervals across the Mont Terri clay-rich fault zone which is an analogue to a minor fault that would hardly be detectable from surface seismic surveys during the initial design of a sequestration site. While pressurizing the intervals at maximum injection pressures of 5 to 6.3 MPa, we simultaneously monitored fault displacement, pore pressure and injection flowrate in two boreholes. A large (factor of 100 to 1000) transmissivity increase occurred in the fractured damage zone intervals close to the interface with the fault core. No significant transmissivity variation was measured in the fault core. The transmissivity variations in the fault damage zone occurred at pressures above 3.9 to 4.4 MPa, corresponding to the hydraulic opening of natural shear planes oriented N039 to N058 and dipping 59 to 69°E. They are associated with slip on the order of 0.01 mm to larger than 0.1 mm on the activated planes, the highest value being observed at the interface between the low permeable fault core and the damage zone. Contrasted fault movements were observed, mainly dilatant in the fault core, highly dilatant-normal slip at the fault core-damage zone interface, and low dilatant-strike-slip-reverse in the damage-to-intact zones. These results suggest an important role of local alteration of “regional” stress at the core-damage zone interface on fault hydraulic property variations with limited slip, an important finding when evaluating the loss of natural seal integrity of CO2 sequestration sites.
Adaptive sparse representation based on circular-structure dictionary learning and its application in wheelset-bearing fault detection
 Wheelset bearings are among the crucial elements of bogie frames used in high-speed trains. Wheelset-bearing fault detection can actively reduce or preclude safety-related accidents and realize condition-based maintenance in high-speed train service. Therefore, it is of great significance to automatically detect wheelset-bearing faults. Sparse representations based on circular-structure dictionary learning (SRCSDL) provide an excellent framework for extracting fault impact trains (FITs) induced by wheelset-bearing faults. However, the performance of SRCSDL on extracting FITs heavily relies on the selection of method-related parameters. A systematic method for selecting such parameters has not been reported in the literature. A novel fault detection method, adaptive SRCSDL (ASRCSDL), is therefore proposed in this paper. The effects of the selection of each SRCSDL parameter on extracting FITs are investigated. It was found that three parameters (the length of single set signals, the number of signal sets, and convergence error) can be fixed according to the characteristics of the SRCSDL algorithm. To adaptively tune the remaining three parameters, main frequency analysis is used to select the number of kernel functions, the number of maximum extreme values is employed to determine the length of the kernel function, and envelope spectra kurtosis-guided self-tuning algorithms are proposed to tune the target sparsity of SRCSDL. The proposed method is then validated using the simulated signals and bench and real-line tests.
High impedance fault location in 11 kV underground distribution systems using wavelet transforms
 Detecting and locating high impedance fault (HIF) in distribution system is a crucial task. HIF causes insulation degradation and over time will lead to supply interruptions. However, it is quite challenging to locate HIF since changes of voltage or current signal during the fault is insignificant and not able to trigger protection system. Besides, the complexity of the distribution system such as non-homogenous line and lateral with branches increase the difficulty in detecting and locating HIF. Considering these issues, this paper presents a method to detect and locate HIF based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) Multi-Resolution Analysis. In the method, fault features from voltages measured at primary substation are extracted using DWT and matched with the pre-developed database from simulation. Due to single measurement and multiple branches, the matching will produce multiple possible faulted sections. This problem is then solved by applying ranking analysis to rank the possible faulted sections from the most likely to the least likely faulted section. The proposed method has been tested with all types of faults on a 38-node distribution network system in Malaysia using the PSCAD/EMTDC software. The test results revealed the effectiveness of the method. Since only single measurement of voltage signal is needed, the method is considered economical for practical implementation.
A permanent fault tolerant dynamic task allocation approach for Network-on-Chip based multicore systems
 Rapid advancement in deep sub-micron regime has made the integration of multiple processing elements possible on a single chip. This has enabled parallel execution of applications on Network-on-Chip (NoC) based multiprocessor platforms. Task mapping and scheduling play crucial roles in timing response and energy consumption of such systems. Tasks present in these applications can be of mixed critical in nature with different importance. However, the on-chip processors executing these tasks of any given application might fail during runtime. Fault tolerance becomes challenging when real-time applications with mixed critical requirements are hosted on such fault prone environment. The complexity of the problem is further magnified in dynamic scenarios when such real-time applications can enter or leave the multicore platform at any time instant. Although several prior works have addressed fault tolerant resource allocation for mixed critical applications, few of these consider permanent processor faults. In this work, an improved fault tolerant resource allocation strategy is presented to mitigate the effect of permanent processor faults on mixed critical applications. The proposed algorithm offers a runtime solution to the unified problem of fault tolerant mapping and scheduling for real-time applications. Both the temporal property of the tasks and the timing information of the faults have been considered while implementing a suitable fault tolerance strategy that reduces the communication energy consumption and provides an improved level of quality of service for the executing applications. A detailed evaluation of the performance of the proposed algorithm has been conducted for different applications. On comparing with other state-of-the-art fault tolerant approaches, the proposed policy shows 28.5% average reduction in communication energy consumption while achieving 34.7% improved quality of service. Additionally, the proposed scheme shows better scalability in comparison to the recent techniques reported in literature.
Stability improvement of fixed speed induction generator wind farm using STATCOM during different fault locations and durations
 This paper investigates the impact of the fault ride through on the stability of fixed speed wind farm interconnected grid. The effect of fault location and its duration time are studied for different fault types. The contribution of Static Synchronous Compensator STATCOM to support the fixed-speed wind farm interconnected electric grid during different fault locations and different fault duration times are investigated. Simulation test cases using MATLAB-Simulink are implemented on a 9 MW wind farm exports a power to 120 KV grid. The simulation results show the influence of fault location and its duration on active power, reactive power, and bus voltage of the wind farm.
Two novel proposed discrete wavelet transform and filter based approaches for short-circuit faults detection in power transmission lines
 In this study, two approaches are presented to detect short-circuit faults in power transmission lines. The two proposed methods are completely novel from both theoretical and technical aspects. The first approach is a soft computing method that uses discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies mother wavelets db1, db2, db3, and db4. The second approach is a hardware based method that utilizes a novel proposed two-stage finite impulse response filter with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz, and a very short process time about three samples time. The two approaches are analyzed by presenting theoretical results. Simulated results obtained by simulating a three-phase 230 kV, 50 Hz power transmission line are given that validate the theoretical results, and explicitly verify that the filter based approach has an accuracy of 100% in presence of 10% disturbance while the accuracy of the wavelet transform based approach is maximally 97%, but it has less complication and implementation cost. Another comparative study between this work and other works shows that the two proposed methods have higher accuracy and very shorter process time compared to the other methods, especially in presence of 10% disturbance that actually occurs in power transmission lines.
Fault classification in power systems using EMD and SVM
 In recent years, power quality has become the main concern in power system engineering. Classification of power system faults is the first stage for improving power quality and ensuring the system protection. For this purpose a robust classifier is necessary. In this paper, classification of power system faults using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is proposed. EMD is used for decomposing voltages of transmission line into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) is used for extracting characteristic features from IMFs. A multiple SVM model is introduced for classifying the fault condition among ten power system faults. Algorithm is validated using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. Results demonstrate that the combination of EMD and SVM can be an efficient classifier with acceptable levels of accuracy.
An adaptive three-phase reclosure scheme for shunt reactor-compensated transmission lines based on the change of current spectrum
 In this paper, a new three-phase adaptive reclosing scheme for transmission lines with shunt reactors is proposed to identify fault nature and determine the arc extinction time under the single and double-phase-to-ground faults. According to the fact that the faulted phase currents of shunt reactors contain only one oscillating frequency before the fault extinction and contain other two different oscillating frequencies when the fault is extinguished, this change of current frequency can be used to distinguish transient faults. When sampling rate is an integral multiple of the faulted phase current frequency of shunt reactors under permanent faults, an abrupt increase of currents even harmonics which is caused by spectral leakage of the DFT algorithm under non-synchronous sampling can lead to identify transient faults and three-phase reclosing. Electromagnetic Transient Program simulation results verify the correctness of the frequency spectrum characteristic analysis of the faulted currents of shunt reactor. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is also tested under different fault condition.
A survey on fault-tolerant application mapping techniques for Network-on-Chip
 Reliability is becoming a major concern in Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) design. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with different types of faults at different levels of a NoC. This paper surveys the work performed on fault-tolerant mapping techniques in NoCs. A classification is proposed, based on the approaches adopted to recover from failures. Techniques based on the combination of mapping and routing, techniques based on redundancy, and techniques based on task remapping are the main categories of the classification proposed. Furthermore, performance comparison among the listed techniques is provided to highlight the differences. A discussion of the proposed techniques is also performed for each category, leading to some open issues.
Multi fluid-flow record during episodic mode I opening: A microstructural and SIMS study (Cotiella Thrust Fault, Pyrenees)
 Syntectonic veins commonly have been used to assess the composition and source of fluids involved in fault zone activity. Such veins also provide information on the ambient stress conditions during deformation and mineralization. Based on bulk sampling and bulk O- and C-isotope analysis, combined with fluid inclusion microthermometry, many studies have demonstrated that syntectonic veins provide snapshots of fluid composition and stress conditions over the course of fault history. This is widely acknowledged for mode I extension veins that develop in the damage zones of faults. However, an important and unanswered question is the extent to which such veins record a more detailed fault history at the micron scale. In this study, we present new detailed in-situ micron-scale δ18O data, measured using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), combined with detailed fluid inclusion microthermometry and Δ47 clumped isotope thermometry to document the fluid and temperature conditions during mode I vein growth related to deformation along the Cotiella thrust fault (Pyrenees). All the studied veins show three distinct episodes of vein opening, recording a complex history of varying fluid composition and temperature. Results show that the studied fault portion passed from a hydrological rock-buffered system, in which formation waters were in isotopic equilibrium with the host sediments, to a fluid-buffered system involving meteoric water. However, such information is only achievable at the micron scale using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry. This study demonstrates the potential of these new micro-beam techniques for investigating fault behavior in more detail than previously available, particularly with respect to the nature of the fluids involved and the P–T conditions extant during fault activity.
Optimal demodulation subband selection for sun gear crack fault diagnosis in planetary gearbox
 Envelope analysis (EA) is one of the most usually used demodulation methods for fault diagnosis of gearboxes, the main problem for EA is to find a frequency subband that contains more fault-related components. However, modulation phenomenon can be observed for both healthy and damaged situations in planetary gearboxes. And most of the traditional EA techniques cannot distinguish the fault-related modulation components from fault-unrelated modulation components, which may leads to a degradation of the fault diagnosis method for planetary gearbox. In order to overcome the problem of finding the subband that contains the most fault-related modulation components, this paper proposed a new optimal demodulation subband selection method (ODSSM) for fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. With the proposed method, the fault-related degree of each subband is evaluated based on a new index that measuring the ratio of fault-related modulation components to fault-unrelated modulation components in envelope spectrum. The index then is employed to find the optimal demodulation subband in the entire frequency range based on genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, fault diagnosis results can be obtained based on EA method. For validation, the proposed method and other two methods are utilized to detect the sun gear crack fault in planetary gearbox. The results show that the proposed method can detect the gear fault in both simulation signals and experiment signals, and achieves improved demodulation performance than the other two methods.
An energy differential relay for long transmission lines
 The operating speed and sensitivity of the current differential protection must be lowered in order to deal with the problems caused by the capacitive currents of the long transmission line. To solve this problem, a new energy differential relay is put forward. The proposed scheme can distinguish between internal and external faults by comparing the energies of two methods. The first method is to calculate the energy flow in the line in a short time interval. The second method is to calculate the energy consumption of distributed elements on the transmission line with the assumption that there is no internal fault on the line. Special means are adopted: use of modal quantities of voltage and current; the instantaneous voltage and current are distributed linearly along the transmission line; the instantaneous voltage and current vary linearly during a sampling interval; the sampling interval is equal to the travel time of the protected line. Thus the energies can be calculated by using the sampled values at each end of the transmission line. It has been proven that the calculated energies of the two different methods are equal when there is no internal fault on the transmission line. The performance of the proposed method has been verified by EMTP simulation tests, dynamic simulation tests and the comparison with a competitive method.
Centralized coordination of emergency control and protection system using online outage sensitivity index
 This paper determines the best locations for centralized load shedding considering the protection systems that can be monitored from transmission system to avoid cascading failures. The vulnerability of power system integrity is determined and ranked using online outage sensitivity index (OSI) considering ampacity of transmission lines, over excitation of generators and transformers, under frequency and under voltage protection relays and low voltage ride through capability of grid connected renewable energy sources. The power system elements are ranked based on the results of outage sensitivity index (OSI) to concentrate the load shedding as control action on areas containing most critical elements prone to outage. The efficiency of proposed multi objective approach is validated through numerical simulations of severe contingencies carried out in DigSilent Power Factory software on 39 bus IEEE standard test system.
Research on transformer fault diagnosis method and calculation model by using fuzzy data fusion in multi-sensor detection system
 In order to achieve the failure of unattended power network equipment, this paper proposes a new transformer fault diagnosis method by using multi band infrared imager sensor and discharge circuit detection sensor to set up the eight sensors detection platform. Analyzes the transformer fuzzy fault characteristics, designs the detection platform of transformer fault diagnosis, establishes a transformer fuzzy fault diagnosis model with the exponential trust function of the photoelectric sensor, the average weighted consistency of each photoelectric sensor and the support degree of the photoelectric sensors, gives the data fusion method with the trust function of the sensor and the maximum model value. Through experiment and analysis, this fault diagnosis model can improve the fusion precision and diagnostic accuracy more effectively than the general fusion algorithm and arithmetic mean value algorithm, and can scientifically diagnose the transformer equipment of power grid from multi angle. Thereby, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified.
Improvement of integrated transmission line transfer index for power system voltage stability
 With the increased loading of transmission lines, the voltage stability problem has become a critical issue for most power system planners and operators. Some important studies related to the voltage stability indices used in the electric power systems are first sorted. Then, a new approach for voltage stability is developed to find the weak lines in this paper. The new method is based on the practical line ABCD parameters, the power factor of receiving end, and the power angle between the sending end and the receiving end. This concept of integrated transmission line transfer index (ITLTI) is derived for a radial transmission system and later applied to a large system. However, ITILI index has a more integrated content and should be a better solution for on line voltage stability evaluation. The new ITLTI index and other existing techniques are demonstrated and compared with numerical studies by IEEE 14-bus test system, using gradually increase reactive load.
Experimental location of damage in microelectronic solder joints after a board level reliability evaluation
 Reliability evaluation of integrated circuit (IC) packages to assess drop impact is critical, especially in the case of handheld electronic products. The objective of this study is to experimentally identify the location of damage in solder joints in electronic packaging after a board level reliability (BLR) evaluation. The BLR drop test is a useful way to characterize the drop durability of different soldered assemblies onto a printed circuit board (PCB). It is also of great importance when there is a need to evaluate the solder joint between the chip package and PCB through a daisy-chained structure during the evaluation period. However, there is no detailed information available on a pattern ground with a hatched copper PCB layout for high speed responses that are closely related to actual working conditions. In this paper, a fault location on a daisy-chained structure with a pattern ground is shown through a non-destructive analysis using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) approach. The results obtained in this project indicate that the TDR approach can be used to detect the location of a crack in the string based on changes in the waveform response. The fault location in critical solder balls as predicted by TDR correlate well with experimental observation by cross-section.
Sandstone-filled normal faults: A case study from central California
 Despite the potential of sandstone-filled normal faults to significantly influence fluid transmissivity within reservoirs and the shallow crust, they have to date been largely overlooked. Fluidized sand, forcefully intruded along normal fault zones, markedly enhances the transmissivity of faults and, in general, the connectivity between otherwise unconnected reservoirs. Here, we provide a detailed outcrop description and interpretation of sandstone-filled normal faults from different stratigraphic units in central California. Such faults commonly show limited fault throw, cm to dm wide apertures, poorly-developed fault zones and full or partial sand infill. Based on these features and inferences regarding their origin, we propose a general classification that defines two main types of sandstone-filled normal faults. Type 1 form as a consequence of the hydraulic failure of the host strata above a poorly-consolidated sandstone following a significant, rapid increase of pore fluid over-pressure. Type 2 sandstone-filled normal faults form as a result of regional tectonic deformation. These structures may play a significant role in the connectivity of siliciclastic reservoirs, and may therefore be crucial not just for investigation of basin evolution but also in hydrocarbon exploration.
A dependence-based feature vector and its application on planetary gearbox fault classification
 To achieve planetary gearbox fault classification, vibration signal analysis has been widely employed with rich information about the health status and easy measurement. It is critical to extract features with enough health status information for fault classification. The self-adaptation of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) indicates the dependence between the raw vibration signal and EEMD-decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In this study, we develop a novel fault feature vector based on the dependence. To develop the dependence-based feature vector, simulated vibration signals with different sun gear tooth crack levels are analyzed. The dependence between the raw signal and each IMF is investigated by Archimedean copulas. With the goodness-of-fit test, the copula estimation closest to the perfect fit is selected for dependence representation. The parameter of the selected copula is applied to develop the dependence-based feature vector. To test the ability of the dependence-based feature vector in fault classification for a real planetary gearbox, experimental vibration signals with different gear fault levels at different gears are classified by a multi-class support vector machine. The classification accuracy of the developed feature vector is compared with that of a reported indicator. Results show the dependence-based feature vector provides higher classification accuracy than the reported, indicating the developed feature vector contains more health status information. The developed feature vector can serve better for planetary gearbox fault classification.
Non-intrusive fault identification of power distribution systems in intelligent buildings based on power-spectrum-based wavelet transform
 A new approach for protection of power distribution systems in intelligent buildings has been presented in this paper. Directly adopting the wavelet transform coefficients (WTCs) requires longer computation time and larger memory requirements for the non-intrusive fault monitoring (NIFM) identification process. However, the WTCs contain plenty of information needed for the symmetric and asymmetric transient signals of fault events. To effectively reduce the number of WTCs representing fault transient signals without degrading performance, a power spectrum of the WTCs in different scales calculated by Parseval’s Theorem is proposed in this paper. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs), in combination with power-spectrum-based wavelet transform, are used to identify fault types and locations in power distribution systems of industrial buildings by using NIFM. The high success rates of fault event recognition for load-bus faults and transmission-line faults from simulations have proved that the proposed algorithm is applicable to fault identifications of non-intrusive monitoring applications.
Misoperation analysis of steady-state and transient methods on earth fault locating in compensated distribution networks
 Earth fault detection and location are very important issues in distribution networks. Current methods for faulty feeder selection are based on measurements of steady-state or transient signals. The work presented here identifies and gives analyses of scenarios when ground protection based on these methods is prone to misoperation in resonance grounded systems. It is shown that the traditional watt-metric approach can malfunction depending on network and fault parameters. The admittance methods help to eliminate many issues, however they might have complex settings depending on network configurations. Special attention is paid to approaches based on transient signals as the most promising alternative solution. The current work considers methods utilizing zero sequence current, angle, power, energy and admittance transients. The paper reveals limitations for their application mainly due to presence of electrostatic asymmetry, cables in a network, fault resistance and inception angle. Nevertheless, dependability of these methods is higher than the steady-state especially for intermittent faults. It is also found that analysis of prefault information is important both for the steady-state and the transient methods. The obtained results can be used to enhance reliability of protective schemes and as drivers for further developments of new algorithms.
Comparison of impedance based fault location methods for power distribution systems
 Performance of 10 fault location methods for power distribution systems has been compared. The analyzed methods use only measurements of voltage and current at the substation. Fundamental component during pre-fault and fault are used in these methods to estimate the apparent impedance viewed from the measurement point. Deviation between pre-fault and fault impedance together with the system parameters are used to estimate the distance to the fault point. Fundamental aspects of each method have been considered in the analysis. Power system topology, line and load models and the necessity of additional information are relevant aspects that differentiate one method from another. The 10 selected methods have been implemented, tested and compared in a simulated network. The paper reports the results for several scenarios defined by significant values of the fault location and impedance. The estimated error has been used as a performance index in the comparison.
A NEW NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR FAULT LOCATION ESTIMATION USING TWO-TERMINAL SYNCHRONIZED VOLTAGE AND CURRENT PHASORS
 This paper presents a new numerical algorithm for fault location estimation which uses data from both end of the transmission line. The proposed algorithm is based on the synchronized phasors measured from the PMUs (Phasor Measurement Units) installed at both terminals of the transmission lines. Based on the length of the transmission line, the proposed algorithms are divided into the short line (without shunt capacitance) and long line algorithm (with shunt capacitance). For the purpose of the unknown fault distance the phasor calculation method is used. The proposed algorithm is tested through computer simulations to show its effectiveness.
Methodology for information extraction from oscillograms and its application for high-impedance faults analysis
 Safety and quality of supply represent targets that power distribution companies always strive to meet. Among those occurrences that can have simultaneous deleterious effects on both these targets, High-Impedance Faults (HIFs) stand out since the magnitudes of the effects on the system are too small to activate the relevant system protection devices. In this context, the main aim of this article is to present a new mathematical method for analysis of power systems transient events. This technique was used in the pre-processing of signals to help locate and identify Single Line-to-Ground (SLG) faults. The orthogonal component decomposition technique was tested qualitatively with the help of a real fault oscillogram recorded at a power distribution substation. Computer simulations based on a real distribution feeder model were performed and the numerical results showed that decomposition by Orthogonal Components was able to extract information with more than 80% correlation with the fault occurrence, almost 70% for the location and showed great immunity to the fault resistance effect.
Distribution networks HIF location: A frequency domain system model and WLS parameter estimation approach
 High impedance fault location still represents a challenge for protection engineers. In this work, an analytical formulation for high impedance fault location in power distribution systems is presented, based on system parameters estimation. The proposed method is based on a frequency domain system model, developed considering a high impedance fault model composed by two antiparallel diodes and an arc resistance. The proposed model is an overdetermined nonlinear algebraic system of equations in which the solution is obtained through a Weighted Least Square approach. A residual analysis is applied for estimate selection. The proposed method considers the capacitive effect through an exact line segment model for overhead distribution lines, using only local voltages and currents as input data. Validation is done through numerical simulations using the IEEE system 13 buses test feeder, a real distribution system from the RGE Sul Power Utility (Southern Brazil), and a real high impedance fault recorded from a digital relay. Comparative test results with the state-of-the-art highlights the method's high accuracy, indicating potential aspects for real life application. Overall average errors of 0.3% considering a complete HIF model were obtained, and a 1.39% error considering a real HIF in a rural feeder. The formulation is currently used by protection engineers at RGE Sul as a reliability oriented tool.
Statistical decision-tree based fault classification scheme for protection of power transmission lines
 This paper presents a statistical algorithm for classification of faults on power transmission lines. The proposed algorithm is based upon the wavelet transform of three phase currents measured at the sending end of a line and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method, a commonly available statistical method. Wavelet transform of current signal provides hidden information of a fault situation as an input to CART algorithm, which is used to classify different types of faults. The proposed technique is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK software and it is tested upon the data created with the fault analysis of the 400 kV sample transmission line considering wide variations in the operating conditions. The classification results are also compared with the results obtained using back propagation neural network.
A practical first-zone distance relaying algorithm for long parallel transmission lines
 This paper presents a novel non-iterative first-zone distance relaying algorithm for single-line-to-ground fault detection in long parallel transmission lines. The conventional distance protection scheme is based on the series impedance line model, in which the shunt capacitance and propagation effects are neglected. Such a simplification, despite being adequate for short lines, can lead to significant errors in the apparent impedance estimation for long-distance faults. The proposed algorithm is derived from a distributed parameter line model applicable to long parallel lines, in which the shunt capacitance and mutual impedance and admittance are all fully considered. Sliding faults simulations were carried out in MATLAB using symmetrical components and graph theory assuming two long parallel transmission lines. It is shown that the proposed algorithm leads to a very good agreement between the apparent and positive-sequence impedances to the faults for line lengths up to approximately 800 km, without using iterative methods. This indicates that the proposed algorithm prevents the distance relay from underreaching for long-distance faults in parallel lines, without additional computational cost.

Parallel processing algorithm for railway signal fault diagnosis data based on cloud computing
 To explore the data processing of high-speed railway fault signal diagnosis based on MapReduce algorithm, the partitioning strategy of data flow was improved, and Bias classification algorithm was used to model and classify data. In MapReduce parallelization process, the data partition matrix Tk was stored in line segmentation, the computing load was distributed in every node of cluster, and the time consumption of mobile data matrix and the consumption of partitioned matrix were calculated. Results show that the algorithm proposed could reduce the amount of computation in the execution process, greatly reduce the memory space consumption, and improve the counting speed in railway signal system.
A multiconductor transmission line model for grounding grids
 In this paper, a new approach for modeling grounding grids excited by lightning currents is proposed. The model is based on considering each set of parallel conductors in the grounding grid as a multiconductor transmission line. Electrical parameters are calculated and modal analysis is used in order to obtain a two port network representation for each set of parallel conductors in the grid. The different two port networks are interconnected following the pattern of connections in the grid; then, the system equations are reduced in order to obtain currents and voltages in the different grid junctions. This approach facilitates calculating the transient leakage currents into the soil and therefore the induced voltage on the soil surface. Finally, the transient step and touch voltages are calculated. The computer model was validated by means of an extensive comparison between obtained results with the proposed model, measurements and calculated results published in the literature. The validation process was extended successfully to grounding grids and vertical and horizontal electrodes.
An HVDC line parameters estimation method without optimization
 This paper proposes a method to estimate HVDC line parameters. After a reminder on the transfer functions that characterize the dynamic behavior of a DC line, link between these transfer functions resonance frequencies and the line parameters is established. This link is then used to estimate the line parameters, the resonance frequencies being determined using the power spectral density of voltage signals at the input and output of the line. A numerical example highlights the efficiency of the proposed method which is finally reduced to a very simple algorithm. This algorithm does not involve optimization, thereby reducing the calculation time and the resources required for its implementation. This new estimation method can be used for fault detection and location.
Sensors Installation Guide to Monitor Automatic Transmission Performance
 This paper aims to answer a key question during the design and development of a new product i.e. how many and where should one install the sensors to ensure effective health monitoring. In this paper, a sensor installation guideline for a 4R automatic transmission is presented. The guideline helps to visualize different possible combinations of sensors and their locations such that all malfunctions are monitored. The guideline is an outcome of structural analysis conducted on a kinematic model of the transmission. Faults in sensors, clutches and band brakes have been considered. The list of sensors include speed sensors to monitor shaft speeds and pressure sensors that can sense if the clutches/brakes are engaged or disengaged. It is concluded that turbine speed sensor, output shaft speed sensor and a pressure sensor can help to isolate all possible faults in the transmission under consideration.
Line-Fault Ride-Through (LFRT) Capabilities of DFIG Wind Turbine Connected to the Power System
 With increased penetration of wind power into electrical grids, DFIG wind turbines are largely deployed due to their variable speed feature and hence influencing system dynamics. According to grid codes issued by utilities, tripping of wind turbines following power system faults is not allowed. Besides, to provide voltage support to the grid, reactive current supply is necessary. This paper studies the power flow (PF) of two different networks, the first is a transmission network and the second is a distribution one, A wind Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) turbine is injected to these different networks. A line fault right through (LFRT) is applied on each network and the power flow results are given and compared, then a new solution is proposed to connect the wind turbine to the distribution network with a down transformer to not disconnect the wind turbine during the LFRT, the power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) is used in this work.
Generic scalable fault diagnosis system for multimachine power grids
 A new approach for fault diagnosis in power grids is presented in this paper. The approach is capable of detecting, classifying and locating, with high speed and accuracy, any type of faults anywhere in the grid using bus voltage or line current measurements only. Fault detection and classification is accomplished by applying logic on measured data while fault location is determined by fault location identification functions generated off-line by using a least-square support vector machine. The high speed and accuracy aspects of the proposed approach are verified through case studies in three test power systems.
A comprehensive review on DC arc faults and their diagnosis methods in photovoltaic systems
 Integration of renewable energy including solar energy is growing faster than ever before. Solar energy supplies more than 1.3% of global power, and it is predicted to become the largest electricity source by 2050 with about 11% of global power consumption. However, the improper installation, non-frequently scheduled maintenance, and aging effect can accelerate the deterioration of PV system components, which directly increase the possibility of arc fault occurrence. The undetected arc faults pose a severe fire hazard to residential, commercial, and utility-scaled PV systems. To deliver electricity in a safe and reliable manner, such a dangerous event must be detected at early stage. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the-state-of-art techniques for DC arc faults detection in photovoltaic systems (PV). Different methods and the features used for detection are discussed and compared in detail. This paper also emphasizes the importance of DC arc fault simulation for characteristics study and fault diagnosis purpose. Several DC arc fault models have been reviewed and compared.
A comprehensive study on different types of faults and detection techniques for solar photovoltaic system
 Monitoring systems are essential to maintain optimal performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems. A critical aspect in such monitoring systems is the fault diagnosis technique being used. The role of a fault detection and diagnosis technique is to identify the causes affecting the real-time energy production and/or smooth functioning of PV systems. Over the past decade, various fault detection methods were reported in literature. Among all the fault detection techniques reported, some paid significant attention only on faults that occur in the PV system, some on faults on DC side of the PV system while the rest focused on AC side faults. For the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive review of popular fault detection techniques, addressing all major types of faults in PV systems. Detailed insights of PV fault detection techniques along with their relative performances are covered. A new fault detection technique is also proposed to identify the type and location (module level) of a fault. This review enables the reader to get acquaintance with major aspects/considerations in developing/choosing an effective yet viable fault detection technique for small and medium scale PV systems.
Fast fault detection and classification based on a combination of wavelet singular entropy theory and fuzzy logic in distribution lines in the presence of distributed generations
 This paper proposes a new method of fault detection and classification in asymmetrical distribution systems with dispersed generation to detect islanding and perform protective action based on applying a combination of wavelet singular entropy and fuzzy logic. In this method, positive components of currents at common coupling points are decomposed to adjust detailed coefficients of wavelet transforms and singular value matrices, and expected entropy values are calculated via stochastic process. Indexes are defined based on the wavelet singular entropy in positive components and three phase currents to detect and classify the fault. This protection scheme is put forward for fault detection and is investigated in different types of faults such as single-phase to ground, double-phase to ground, three-phase to ground and line to line in distribution lines in the presence of distributed generations, and different locations of faults are verified when the distributed generation is connected to the utility. The major priority of the proposed protection scheme is its reduction in time (10 ms from the event inception) in distinguishing islanding and protection transmission lines in the presence of distributed generations.
Mechanical behaviors and failure mechanisms of buried polyethylene pipes crossing active strike-slip faults
 Polyethylene (PE) pipes are widely used in gas transmission projects due to their excellent performances. Earthquake is destructive and difficult to predicted, which is one of the major disasters caused PE pipe failure. The study was conducted on the mechanical behaviors and failure mechanisms of buried PE pipes under fault movement, and the effects of gas pressure, fault dislocation, soil and pipe size on the mechanical behavior of PE pipes were discussed. The study indicates that gas pressure has a less effect on the mechanical behavior of PE pipe. Under faults, the flatness curve of PE pipe is distributed symmetrically with respect to the fault plane. Deformation rules of PE pipe in different stratums are similar, while the pipe deformation is the largest in clay and it is smallest in sand. The greater the standard pipe size, the greater the diameter flatness coefficient is. The larger the diameter, the smaller the pipe diameter flattening parameter is. PE pipes with a larger standard dimension ratio of a fitting (SDR) and a smaller diameter are prone to failure in fault zone. The results can provide a basis for gas pipe design, laying, testing, and evaluation.
Non-linear representation of voltage sag profiles for fault location in distribution networks
 Fault location for distribution networks with multiple laterals would requires additional information such as from fault indicators and protective devices. As SCADA systems to provide such information are limited in 11 kV or lower voltage distribution networks, effective fault location method that only use information from a measurement at primary substation is needed. This paper presents the application of calculated non-linear voltage sag profiles and voltage sag measurement at primary substation to locate a fault in distribution networks. The proposed method firstly identifies the faulted section. From the indentified section, fault distance is calculated. The method has been tested under different fault scenarios that include various fault resistance, loading variation and data measurement errors. The results indicate the possibility of using this method to support automatic fault management system.
Sparse classification based on dictionary learning for planet bearing fault identification
 Planet bearing vibrations feature high complexity due to the intricate kinematics and multiple modulation effects. This leads to difficulty in planet bearing fault identification. In order to overcome this difficulty, a sparse classification framework based on dictionary learning is proposed. It operates directly on raw signals and is free from steps involved in conventional pattern identification such as feature design which requires prior expertise. First, a raw signal matrix is generated by partitioning the raw signal into segments, where each segment in all signal states has the same number of data points, and the length of the segment should guarantee that at least two adjacent fault impulses with the maximum interval can occur. Then, a dictionary initialized with the training sample set is learnt from the signal matrix, based on which the sparse representation is carried out afterwards. A dictionary learnt over signals under a certain state is best suited for signal reconstruction under the same state only but cannot recover signals well under other states. Inspired by this fact, sparse classification can be accomplished by comparing signal recovery errors over dictionaries under different states. The proposed method is validated using the experimental data of a planetary gearbox. Localized faults on the outer race, roller element and inner race of planet bearings are all identified successfully.
Anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine components based on deep learning network
 Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using early fault detection methods can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs before they reach a catastrophic stage. To achieve anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine components, this paper proposes a deep learning method based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE) network using operational supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines. First, a component DAE network model using multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) was constructed. Previously collected normal SCADA data from wind turbines were used to train this multilayer network model layer-wise to extract the relationships between SCADA variables. Then, a reconstruction error (Re) was calculated by using the DAE network input and its output reconstruction value, which was defined as the condition detection index to reflect the component health condition. Due to the acute changes and disturbances of wind speed in actual operation, the calculated detection index always has an extreme distribution that can cause false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive threshold determined by the extreme value theory was proposed and used as the rule of anomaly judgement. The method can not only implement early warning of fault components but also deduce the physical location of a faulted component by DAE residuals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by some reported failure cases of wind turbine components.
A survey on model-based fault diagnosis for linear discrete time-varying systems
 To meet the rising demands for safety and reliability of modern industrial control systems, the model-based fault diagnosis problem has attracted much attention in the past few decades both from the academic communities and in practical applications. Among the rich body of literature, the majority of the results are proposed for linear time invariant systems despite the fact that most practical processes are inherently time-varying by nature and discretized for online implementations. Recently, with the ever-increasing system complexity and scale, the model-based fault diagnosis issue for linear discrete time-varying (LDTV) systems has become a hot research topic of both theoretical importance and practical significance, and a great number of results have been reported with many open problems deserving further investigation. To reflect the latest progress in this emerging research branch, this survey aims to provide a timely reference to readers interested in this topic. More specifically, in this survey, the techniques for model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV systems are classified into observer-based methods, parity space-based approaches and parameter estimation schemes, which constitute the three main parts of this survey. The background and the latest progress for each class of these techniques are comparatively discussed with particular focuses on the fault detection and the fault estimation issues. Additionally, an overview on their practical applications to specific industrial plants is provided. Furthermore, the possible future research directions concerning the model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV processes are pointed out, followed by comprehensive concluding remarks.
Employing instantaneous positive sequence symmetrical components for voltage sag source relative location
 Modern industrial facilities are vulnerable to voltage sags and short interruptions as they were in the past to sustainable interruptions. Therefore, modern reliability assessment should include voltage sags and short interruptions. Hence, in order to improve power system reliability it is necessary to mitigate these voltage variations. One of the first steps towards this objective is to locate the source of these disturbances. This paper investigates a number of methods for sag source relative location. Said methods are based on different electrical parameters. Using instantaneous positive sequence components, five novel extended methods for voltage sag source location are proposed for accommodating the transient nature of voltage sag events and for improving unsuitable operation of methods on asymmetrical sags and earth faults. Due to the fact that short circuits are the main reason resulting in voltage sags, this paper focuses on the location of voltage sag sources due to line faults. A comparative analysis between the existing methods and the five novel extended methods is performed by applying extensive numerical simulations in a Brazilian regional transmission and sub-transmission utility. Finally, the effectiveness of all methods is obtained. The results show that the novel extended methods are more effective and among them, the extended methods based on reactive power can locate sag sources with an accuracy of 88%. Also, implementation of the novel extended methods on signal processors is easier with respect to the already implemented methods.
Analysis and validation of wavelet transform based DC fault detection in HVDC system
 Fault detection plays an important role in both conventional AC and upcoming DC power systems. This paper aims to study the application of discrete wavelet transform (WT) for detecting the DC fault in the high voltage DC (HVDC) system. The methods of choosing the mother wavelet suited for DC fault is presented, based on degree of correlation to the fault pattern and the time delay. The wavelet analysis is performed on a multi-terminal HVDC system, built in PSCAD/EMTDC software. Its performance is judged for critical parameter like the fault location, resistance and distance. The analysis is further extended to validation using results from experiment, which is obtained from a lab-scale DC hardware setup. Load change, one of the transient disturbances in power system, is carried out to understand the effectiveness of the wavelet transform to differentiate it from the DC fault. The noise in the experimental result gives rise to non-zero wavelet coefficient during the steady-state. This can be improved by removing the unwanted noise using right filter while still retaining the fault-induced transient. The wavelet transform is compared with short-time Fourier transform to highlight the issue with window size and noise.
A data indicator-based deep belief networks to detect multiple faults in axial piston pumps
 Detecting faults in axial piston pumps is of significance to enhance the reliability and security of hydraulic systems. However, it is difficult to detect multiple faults in the hydraulic electromechanical coupling systems because the fault mechanism of some faults is unclear. In this paper, a method using deep belief networks (DBNs) is proposed to detect multiple faults in axial piston pumps. Firstly, for each individual fault, all the data indicators extracted from the raw signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain are calculated to construct training and testing samples. Then, the constructed samples are fed into DBNs to classify the multiple faults in axial piston pumps. With restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) stacked layer by layer, DBNs can automatically learn fault features. Numerical simulations using the benchmark data of five faults in rolling bearings are classified by the present method to select the relative optimal combination of indicators. The classification results are also compared with those commonly used support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to manifest the classification accuracy of the present method. Experimental investigations are performed to classify four faults in an axial piston pump. The classification accuracy ratio is 97.40%, which confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of multiple faults detection in axial piston pumps using DBNs.
A novel thickness detection method of ice covering on overhead transmission line
 Overhead transmission lines are always covered by ice in freezing weather. It's difficult to know about the icing condition of the lines because they usually have large area-span. They will be stretched under the combined action of conductor quality, wind force and ice-covering. This paper deduces the relationship of conductor-weight ratio, iceweight ratio, wind-pressure ratio and conductor length, and proposes a novel thickness detection method of ice covering on overhead line. This method uses travelling wave location equipments to collect travelling wave signal which a circuit breaker generates. The signal's arrival time is detected by Hilbert-Huang Transformation. Then the length of the line can be calculated. Finally, the average thickness of ice covering on transmission line would be calculated by using the formula of the relationship between comprehensive conductor load ratio and ice thickness. Simulation results indicate that the method can effectively calculate the average thickness of ice covering on line. It provides important reference for power workers to know about the icing condition promptly.
Heterogeneous fault diagnosis for wireless sensor networks
 Fault diagnosis has been considered as a very challenging problem in wireless sensor network (WSN) research. Faulty nodes having different behavior such as hard, soft, intermittent, and transient fault are called as heterogeneous faults in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents a heterogeneous fault diagnosis protocol for wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol consists of three phases, such as clustering phase, fault detection phase, and fault classification phase to diagnose the heterogeneous faulty nodes in the wireless sensor networks. The protocol strategy is based on time out mechanism to detect the hard faulty nodes, and analysis of variance method (ANOVA test) to detect the soft, intermittent, and transient faulty nodes in the network. The feed forward probabilistic neural network (PNN) technique is used to classify the different types of faulty nodes in the network. The performance of the proposed heterogeneous fault diagnosis protocol is evaluated using network simulator NS-2.35. The evaluation of the proposed model is also carried out by the testbed experiment in an indoor laboratory environment and outdoor environment.

And then, a fault localization method corresponding to all levels are proposed in detail. Finally we conduct experiments on our experimental platform, and results show that our approach can accurately and quickly achieve the mission of fault location in large-scale distributed measurement system.
High resistive zero-crossing instant faults detection and location scheme based on wavelet analysis
 This paper proposes an effective high resistive zero-crossing fault detection scheme based on transient signals obtained at single-end of the transmission line. The proposed scheme implements wavelet transform to provide time resolution for the high frequency components of the current fault transients. These signals are decomposed into their modal components: aerial and ground modes and, taking into account the fault inception angle; it implements one of both modes to detect faults in the power system. The proposed scheme also provides the distance to fault using the wavelet modulus maxima (WMM) technique. The performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated in a 132 kV transmission system modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC, and results have been presented considering total harmonic distortion of voltage (THDV) waveform and for varying ground resistivity, fault resistance and fault inception angle. The response time of the proposed algorithm has been compared with Fourier and differential equations algorithms and conventional wavelet transform scheme.
Fault tolerant position-mooring control for offshore vessels
 Fault-tolerance is crucial to maintain safety in offshore operations. The objective of this paper is to show how systematic analysis and design of fault-tolerance is conducted for a complex automation system, exemplified by thruster assisted Position-mooring. Using redundancy as required by classification societies' class notations for offshore position controlled vessels, the paper shows how violations of normal behaviour of main components can be detected and isolated. Using a functional service philosophy, diagnosis procedures are auto-generated based on provable correct graph analysis methods. Functional faults that are only detectable, are rendered isolable through an active isolation approach. Once functional faults are isolated, they are handled by fault accommodation techniques to meet overall control objectives specified by class requirements. The paper illustrates the generic methodology by a system to handle faults in mooring lines, sensors or thrusters. Simulations and model basin experiments are carried out to validate the concept for scenarios with single or multiple faults. The results demonstrate that enhanced availability and safety are obtainable with this design approach. While methods are introduced at a tutorial level, the paper is original by providing a total Position-mooring system design that ensures resilience to any single fault and to selected multiple faults.
A comprehensive review on protection challenges and fault diagnosis in PV systems
 With the exponential growth in global photovoltaic (PV) power capacity, protection of PV systems has gained prodigious importance in last few decades. Even with the use of standard protection devices in a PV system, faults occurring in a PV array may remain undetected. Inspired by the ever increasing demand for a reliable fault detection technique, several advanced techniques have been proposed in literature; especially in the last few years. Hence, this paper carries out an in depth analysis of various fault occurrences, protection challenges and ramifications due to undetected faults in PV systems. Furthermore, with a widespread literature, the paper critically reviews numerous fault detection algorithms/techniques available for PV systems which are proven to be effective and feasible to implement. The proposed study is not only limited to surveying the existing techniques but also analyzes the performance of each technique with an emphasis on its: 1) Approach, 2) Sensor requirements, 3) Ability to diagnose and localize faults, 4) Integration complexity, 5) Accuracy, 6) Applicability and 7) Implementation cost. Overall, this paper is envisioned to avail the researchers working in the field of PV systems with a valuable resource, which will assist them to enrich their research works.
An accurate fault location algorithm using synchronized sampling
 This paper introduces new fault location algorithms based on synchronized sampling. A time domain model of a transmission line is used as a basis for the algorithm development. Samples of voltages and currents at the ends of a transmission line are taken synchronously and used to calculate fault location. The paper discusses two different algorithm forms utilizing two line models. A number of tests are performed using EMTP simulations of faults. The algorithm results show high accuracy while the computational burden is moderate.
Performance evaluation of distance protection of transmission lines connected with VSC-HVDC system using closed-loop test in RTDS
 Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) can control voltage and power flow on ac transmission lines with the priority of reactive current support during the fault as suggested in the grid codes for HVDC connections. Furthermore, the fault current contribution from the converter is limited in magnitude and modified in the waveform in order to protect the power electronic devices during the fault, which on the other hand affects the apparent impedance seen by the distance relay. This paper addresses the challenges faced by the distance protection of transmission lines connected with VSC-HVDC system by performing a closed-loop test of a commercial distance relay using Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). The power system with VSC is modeled in detail under a more realistic scenario in RTDS so that the performance of the distance protection can be tested under near to actual field conditions. The responses of the commercial distance relay for balanced and unbalanced faults are analyzed. The oscillograph data of the voltage, current and protection bits recorded by the relay are extracted and compared with the simulation results.
A systematic fuzzy rule based approach for fault classification in transmission lines
 The paper presents a new approach for fault classification in transmission line using a systematic fuzzy rule based approach. Fault classification is one of the important requirements in distance relaying for identifying the accurate phases involved in the fault process. The proposed technique starts with preprocessing the fault current signal using advanced time–frequency transform such as S-transform to compute various statistical features. After the required features are extracted, the Decision Tree (DT), a knowledge representation method, is used for initial classification. From the DT classification boundaries, the fuzzy membership functions (MFs) and corresponding fuzzy rule-base is developed for final classification. Thus a systematic fuzzy rule base is developed for fault classification, reducing the redundancies and complexities involved compared to Heuristic fuzzy rule-based approach. Also a qualitative comparison is made between S-transform and Wavelet transform, where S-transform based DT-fuzzy provides highly improved results compared to the later during simulation as well as experimental tests.
Transmission system protection screening for integration of offshore wind power plants
 This paper develops an efficient methodology for protection screening of large-scale transmission systems as part of the planning studies for the integration of offshore wind power plants into the power grid. This methodology avails to determine whether any upgrades are required to the protection system. The uncertainty is considered in form of variability of the power generation by offshore wind power plant. This paper uses the integration of a 1000 MW offshore wind power plant operating in Lake Erie into the FirstEnergy/PJM service territory as a case study. This study uses a realistic model of a 63,000-bus test system that represents the U.S. Eastern Interconnection.
Transmission line theory
 To someone with a superficial knowledge of electrical technology it seems obvious that when two physically separated points are connected using a length of conducting wire, and assuming the resistance of the wire can be ignored, the voltage at the remote end of the wire will be the same as that at the source. In other words, the physical length of the wire and physical location of the source and destination, again ignoring resistive effects, are immaterial to understanding of how the circuit works.
Use of time delays between modal components in wavelet based fault location
 This paper presents an improved fault location method based on the traveling wave theory of the transmission lines. Fault transients recorded at one end of a transmission line are processed to determine the distance from the fault location. Wavelet transform is utilized for this purpose. The proposed method also takes advantage of the different travel times of the modal components in differentiating between close-in and remote end faults. The approach has the advantages of being independent of the fault impedance, mutual coupling effects and series compensation capacitors. The method's performance for typical faults is illustrated using transient simulations obtained by an electromagnetic transients program.
A review of stochastic resonance in rotating machine fault detection
 Condition-based monitoring and machine fault detection play important roles in industry as they can ensure safety and reduce breakdown loss. Weak signal detection is an essential stage in many signal processing-based machine fault detection methods because the acquired machine signals are always corrupted by heavy background noise. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a nonlinear phenomenon in which the weak signal can be enhanced with the assistance of proper noise. Due to this distinct merit, SR has been extensively investigated in rotating machine fault detection. Given this, the present study is committed to providing a comprehensive review of SR from history to state-of-the-art methods and finally to research prospects, along with the applications in rotating machine fault detection. First, the classical SR theory including the history, merits and limitations is introduced and discussed, and the basic research progress of SR is reviewed. Second, the modified SR methods designed for processing the rotating machine signals are reviewed and summarized. Third, applications of SR for analyzing different kinds of rotating machine fault signals are introduced. Finally, the open problems, challenges and research prospects of SR in rotating machine fault detection are discussed.
The multi-scale generation and transmission expansion model
 One of the challenges in electrical grid expansion planning is how to expand the infrastructure while considering fundamental changes in demand and supply, in part due to “game-changing” consumers, such as electric vehicles (EVs), and optional distributed generation (DG) by consumers. This work proposes an optimization model that addresses the generation and transmission expansion of the grid, including the facilities' locations, upgrades, and the network's design decisions. In contrast to some other models, it is not static in time: the model considers time-dependent demand in short-term (hourly) and long-term (yearly) variations. The proposed optimization model considers energy loss, transmission substations upgrades, constraints such as demand, capacities, and more. The model minimizes the long-term costs of infrastructure investments and the operational costs of generation. The work is supplemented by numerical experiments of the model in simulated scenarios. Sensitivity analysis conducted on some of the model features, demonstrates the importance of including them in the model.
Experimental studies of fault location in PV module strings
 Two methods for the fault location in PV module string were experimentally studied. One was the earth capacitance measurement (ECM) and the other was the time-domain reflectometry (TDR). By ECM, the disconnection position in the string was estimated by the earth capacitance value without the effects of the irradiance change, and the estimation error was small enough to determine the disconnection position in actual repair/maintenance operation. On the other hand, TDR could detect the degradation (series resistance increase) and the positions in the string by the change of response waveform.
Frequency response analysis (FRA) of transformers as a tool for fault detection and location: A review
 Power transformers are one of the most important components of the electrical power networks. A wide range of mechanical and electrical stresses in addition to the aging could cause failures in these apparatuses. As a result, evaluating the condition of the transformers during their lifetime is crucial to the power network reliability and service continuity. A large number of different fault diagnosis techniques are introduced for this purpose. Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is sensitive to the great number of electrical or mechanical changes in the transformers that could occur during the manufacturing, transportation, installation, maintenance or operation of the device. Therefore, FRA is considered among the powerful methods of transformers’ condition assessment. This paper explains the frequency response analysis of transformers method, its application and test procedure as well as providing a comprehensive review of the researches and attempts that are done on different aspects of this field for enhancing quality and repeatability of the test and the interpretation of the results.
Optimum Placement of Fault Current Limiter in 11 kV Distribution System
 Presently a number of radial distribution systems are in operation supplying power to utilities. Due to rapid growth of loads in a distribution system and more network connections, high current flows in the event of short circuit faults in the system. In such cases, the relay co-ordination is disturbed and hence the equipment like circuit breakers needs to be replaced with enhanced ratings. So that relay can handle the new operating currents which are often expensive retrofit costs. In order to mitigate the consequences of huge fault currents in a system a Fault Current Limiter (FCL) is proposed and discussed in this paper. FCLs can be fixed in a power system to enable circuit breakers to operate within their operating range. This paper proposes the application of deterministic method of establishing the optimal placement of FCL in a distribution system. An IEEE 6 bus system has been considered for fault analysis and placement of FCL to reduce the impact of fault.
Unsymmetrical opening of mutually coupled transmission lines
 The aim of this paper is to present a systematic approach of solving unsymmetrical faults due to unsymmetrical opening of mutually coupled transmission lines. Opening a transmission line is equivalent to adding, in parallel with it, another transmission line but having the negative impedance of the same line. This is straightforward if the line is not mutually coupled with other lines in the system. Mutual coupling between parallel and adjacent lines exist due to proximity. Such mutual coupling must be taken into consideration when modifying the bus impedance matrix for the purpose of fault studies due to the opening of mutually coupled transmission lines. In this paper, a systematic approach to applying the bus impedance matrix method for faults involving the switching of mutually coupled lines is presented. The approach is applied to several cases of simulation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical switching of mutually coupled transmission lines.
Handling of unbalanced faults in HVDC-connected wind power plants
 High-voltage DC (HVDC) connections enable integration of wind power plants located very far from shore. The decoupled AC offshore grid comprises multiple WT converters, and the voltage magnitude and frequency is primarily controlled by the offshore high-voltage DC voltage-source converter (VSC-HVDC). Faults in the offshore grid challenge the connected converters to provide an adequate response improving the overall fault behavior. Of special interest are asymmetrical faults due to the resulting unbalanced voltage conditions. This article addresses such conditions in the offshore grid and analyzes the impact on the offshore grid behavior for different converter contributions. Four fault ride-through strategies are studied for the WT converters. The effect of over-modulation of the converter voltages during such voltage conditions is highlighted. A test system is defined to analyze the fault and post-fault behavior. It is found that voltage support from the WT converters in both positive and negative sequence shows the best performance compared to controlled negative sequence current suppression. This scheme helps additionally the VSC-HVDC AC voltage control to return quickly to normal operation. To validate this statement simulations are performed for line-to-line (LL) and single line-to-ground (SLG) faults in immediate vicinity of the VSC-HVDC.
Faults locations in automated distribution system
 This paper presents new techniques for locating short circuit and open conductor faults on automated distribution system. This is a unique method where short circuit and open conductor faults are treated simultaneously. The proposed fault location scheme is capable of accurately identifying the zone in which fault occurs. Temporary faults are also detected which may not result in a blown fuse. Data is made available to the substation remote terminal unit from various automated distribution system equipments. Decision is taken based upon the magnitude of fundamental frequency component of voltage and current phasor. Testing of proposed fault location method has been demonstrated on the laboratory model for its practical use. Analogues simulation results are obtained using electromagnetic transients program (EMTP).
Multi objective optimal allocation of fault current limiters in power system
 Transmission systems, connection of distributed generation to the grid are increased due to increase in power demands. This fact causes the increase in short circuit level of power networks. The occurrence of fault in such networks leads to large short circuit currents throughout the system, which may exceed the rating of existing circuit breakers and can damage system equipment. There are some approaches to reduce this fault current such as power network reinforcement and utilization of fault current limiter (FCLs) in power systems. Power system reinforcement is too difficult if not impractical. Therefore, the utilization of FCLs can provide an effective way to suppress fault currents. The effectiveness of FCL depends on the number of FCLs and their installation location. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to determine the optimal number and location of FCLs to improve the power network reliability and fault current reduction based on different conflicting objective functions. IEEE 39 BUS system and IEEE 57 BUS system are considered to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. The objective functions considered for the optimal allocation are reliability of power system, economic impact and short circuit current reduction. Unlike what has been previously done in literature, in this paper Pareto based optimization algorithms, namely non-dominated sorting algorithm, multiobjective particle swarm optimization and multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, are utilized to deal with this problem. The use of these methods made it possible to obtain the Pareto optimal front in which these objective functions are optimized simultaneously.
Evaluation of relaying impedance algorithms for series-compensated line
 A group of the algorithms of fault-loop impedance determination for digital distance relay applied for protecting a series-compensated line has been considered. The algorithms gathered in two basic families have been tested: (i) the methods based upon Fourier orthogonal components with using both full-cycle and half-cycle data windows; (ii) four variants of the method founded on differential equation techniques, i.e. with applied various digital differentiation rules, with included additional pre-filtration and combined with orthogonal components determination. Extensive simulation studies have been performed for comparing the calculation techniques. Recommendations with respect to impedance algorithms suitable for protection of a series-compensated line have been stated. The other studied algorithm is related to fault direction discrimination for the considered series-compensated line arrangement. Sample simulation results have been presented and discussed.
Performance evaluation of IEEE 802.16 real time polling and unsolicited grant service scheduling for protecting transmission and sub-transmission systems with multi-terminals
 One of the major challenges faced by future energy transmission grids is the issue of how to integrate intermittent renewable energy generation. The other problem is how the transmission and sub-transmission systems with multi-terminals are integrated in one grid. Tapping a line is an economical solution to avoid building new stations, but that creates its own operational and protection challenges. The above limitations are future challenges for the protection of modern power systems. In this paper significant emphasis is placed on the communication part, and the theory and benefits of new protection techniques applied to the power systems are clearly indicated. The wireless “WiMAX” based protection “W-Protection” is a new concept for protecting multi-zones as one unit zone using coordination logic. The W-Protection produces new protection solution to properly identify the faulted zone using the wireless networks such as the IEEE 802.16 based WiMAX technology. The IEDs communication traffic requirements and the application models that map them over the real time polling service (rtPS) and unsolicited grant service (UGS) scheduling services of the IEEE 802.16 standard are extensively studied. The communication between IEDs and the Master Protection Center “MPC” using UGS and rtPS-QoS scheduling service available in WiMAX is also discussed. A discrete event model using OPNET simulation package is used for evaluating the performance of rtPS and USG scheduling services in case of latency. The initial results indicated that IEEE 802.16 network can meet the delay requirement of protection applications.
Fault Permeability and CO2 Storage
 Faults comprise zones of crushed, sheared and fractured rock that have the potential to influence the migration of stored CO2. Fault-zone permeabilities of 10-9 to 10-19 m2 are controlled by many interdependent factors including; fault-zone architecture and rock types, mechanical strength and permeability of host rock, orientation and magnitude of in situ stresses, fracture aperture size and connectivity, fluid properties and burial history. Mitigating the risk of CO2 migration via faults to the atmosphere or into economically valuable resources requires an understanding of the conditions under which they promote fluid flow from the reservoir. In situ flow data from natural seeps indicate that faults can promote the upward flow of CO2, with flux rates being greatest where the highest densities of fractures occur. Flow simulation modelling suggests that low-permeability fault rock may compartmentalise reservoirs giving rise to increased pressures and promoting upward flow of CO2. Migration rates along faults of up to 1000 m/yr are possible and could produce leakage rates of up to 15000 t/yr at natural seeps. These rates are likely to be site specific and positively related to reservoir pressures. Present understanding of fault hydraulic properties is generally not sufficiently complete to predict when and where faults will influence CO2 migration. To improve understanding of fault hydraulic properties, studies of outcrop, analogue and numerical models are required. In situ flow measurements are critical for testing site-specific and generic fault fluid-flow models that are important in establishing guidelines for the inclusion of faults in risk assessment and determining what mitigation measures are most appropriate.
Pressure transient analysis during CO2 push-pull tests into faults for EGS characterization
 With the goal of detecting and characterizing faults and fractures in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), a new technology involving CO2 push-pull testing, active-source geophysical imaging, and well logging has recently been proposed. This technique takes advantage of (1) the contrasting properties of supercritical CO2 and water which cause CO2 to appear distinct from surrounding brine in seismic and other geophysical logging approaches, (2) the non-wetting nature of CO2 which keeps it localized to the faults and fractures to create contrast potentially sufficient for active seismic and well-logging approaches to image faults and fracture zones at EGS sites. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using pressure transient monitoring during CO2 push-pull tests to complement active seismic and wireline well logging for EGS characterization. For this purpose, we developed a 2D model of a prototypical geothermal site (Desert Peak, NV) that includes a single fault. The fault zone consists of a slip plane, fault gouge, and damage zone, and is bounded by the surrounding matrix of the country rock. Through numerical simulation using iTOUGH2, we found that the pressure transient at the monitoring wells in the fault gouge shows unique traits due to the multiphase flow conditions developed by CO2 injection, and varies sensitively on the arrival of the CO2 plume and the degree of CO2 saturation. A sensitivity analysis shows the pressure transient is most sensitive to the fault gouge permeability, but also depends on multiphase flow parameters and the boundary conditions of the fault. An inversion study reveals that the fault gouge permeability can be best estimated with the pressure transient data, whereas additional CO2 saturation data do not improve the accuracy of the inversion significantly.
On the use of continuous-wavelet transform for fault location in distribution power systems
 The paper illustrates a procedure based on the continuous-wavelet transform (CWT) for the analysis of voltage transients due to line faults, and discusses its application to fault location in power distribution systems. The analysis carried out shows that correlation exists between typical frequencies of the CWT-transformed signals and specific paths in the network covered by the traveling waves originated by the fault. The paper presents a procedure for determining fault location in MV distribution systems, which exploits the above-mentioned correlation. The MV distribution system analysed in the paper is accurately represented by means of an EMTP model; various fault types and network characteristics are examined. The paper presents also the basic concepts of a measurement and fault location prototype system with distributed architecture.
A novel unit protective relaying concept based on current signal sequential overlapping derivative transform: Two sides fed transmission line application
 This paper presents a novel and accurate unit protective relaying concept for EHV transmission lines. The proposed protective concept implements a simple current signal sequential over lapping derivative, SOD transform to detect transmission line transient disturbances. It uses both polarity and magnitude of the first disturbance, arrived at relay location, to identify internal and external faults rapidly. The proposed unit protective relaying concept is applied to two sides fed transmission lines. The simulation results presented show that the protective concept is simple with high reliability, sensitivity and achieve an extra high speed relaying. In addition, it has immunity against the influence of the large capacitance of the line, the saturation of the current transformers and the synchronization problems.
Assessment on the influence of resistive superconducting fault current limiter in VSC-HVDC system
 Due to fewer risk of commutation failures, harmonic occurrences and reactive power consumptions, Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based HVDC system is known as the optimum solution of HVDC power system for the future power grid. However, the absence of suitable fault protection devices for HVDC system hinders the efficient VSC-HVDC power grid design. In order to enhance the reliability of the VSC-HVDC power grid against the fault current problems, the application of resistive Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) could be considered. Also, SFCLs could be applied to the VSC-HVDC system with integrated AC Power Systems in order to enhance the transient response and the robustness of the system. In this paper, in order to evaluate the role of SFCLs in VSC-HVDC systems and to determine the suitable position of SFCLs in VSC-HVDC power systems integrated with AC power System, a simulation model based on Korea Jeju-Haenam HVDC power system was designed in Matlab Simulink/SimPowerSystems. This designed model was composed of VSC-HVDC system connected with an AC microgrid. Utilizing the designed VSC-HVDC systems, the feasible locations of resistive SFCLs were evaluated when DC line-to-line, DC line-to-ground and three phase AC faults were occurred. Consequently, it was found that the simulation model was effective to evaluate the positive effects of resistive SFCLs for the effective suppression of fault currents in VSC-HVDC systems as well as in integrated AC Systems. Finally, the optimum locations of SFCLs in VSC-HVDC transmission systems were suggested based on the simulation results.
Near-fault and far-fault ground motion effects on cable-supported bridges
 In this paper a cable-stayed bridge and a suspension bridge with closer main span lengths are considered and the bridge responses obtained from the near-fault and far-fault ground motion cases are compared for both bridge models to underline the relative importance of earthquake ground motions on the bridge responses. As expected, near-fault ground motions have resulted much larger response values for both bridge models if compared with far-fault ground motions. The results of the study also underline that, pulse type near-fault ground motion effect on the suspension bridge model is severe than those of the cable-stayed bridge model.
Wavelet based rule for fault detection
 The paper presents wavelet based fault detection method and the analysis of error rates. The proposed method is based on signal representations in Daubechies wavelet bases. For the designed fault detection rule, the upper bound of non-detection probability is derived. The proposed detection method was tested on benchmark data from the Lublin Sugar Factory in Poland.
Wavelet based noise cancellation technique for fault location on underground power cables
 This paper describes a new algorithm to identify the reflective waves for fault location in noisy environment. The new algorithm is based on the correlation of detail components at adjacent levels of stationary wavelet transform of current signal from one end of the cable. The algorithm is simple and straightforward. Simulation results based on a real power transmission system proved it can detect and locate the fault in very difficult situations.
Railway Location
 In this chapter, the basic principles of railway location are first discussed, followed by line strike. Selection of basic strike of railway lines is the fundamental problem in railway line design. The rationalization of line strike not only directly influences the engineering investment and transport efficiency of the railway project, but also affects the role of designed lines in a railway network. Topographic conditions, especially the average natural ground slopes, exert a tremendous influence on alignment positions and methods for railway location. Engineering geological conditions are also an important basis to decide a line strike and location which determine the stability and economic rationality of the railway buildings. Generally, super major bridges and long tunnels often have influence on partial strike-off alignment of route, while general bridges, culverts, and tunnels which enjoy a large quantity will be laid out according to route. Various environmentally sensitive problems need to be avoided and solved at the early stage of railway survey and design. Finally, adoption of computer-aided railway location and alignment design obviously benefits design quality improvement, manpower and capital saving, and design speed acceleration.
Compound gear-bearing fault feature extraction using statistical features based on time-frequency method
 A small incipient fault in gear and bearing causes multiple faults in gear-bearing system leading to catastrophic failure. The purpose of present study is to explore more complex situation of compound gear-bearing fault. The compound faults such as a fault in the inner and outer race of bearing along with two teeth of gear having corner damage or three teeth of gear having corner damage, etc. are investigated using experimentation. To improve the effectiveness of diagnosis, vibration measurement is done at different speed and load condition. This paper proposes new compound fault features, extracted from continuous and discrete wavelet transform of vibration signal. The methodology consist of proposing the features in time–frequency domain and comparison of its diagnostic potential with respect to the features extracted from time and frequency domain for compound fault identification using three different classifiers. The fault classification accuracy of these features is found to be better than the conventional time and frequency domain parameters.
Waveform asymmetry of instantaneous current signal based symmetrical fault detection during power swing
 This paper proposes a methodology for detection of short-circuit during power swing with easy adjustment, in order to unblock the distance relay and allow its operation. If a fault occurs during power swing, it must be immediately detected and removed. One of the major challenges in these detectors is to distinguish power swing from symmetrical fault near to the electrical center (δ = 180°), as both are balanced phenomena. This work aims to propose a detector of fault which is reliable and capable of detecting a short-circuit occurring in the moment that apparent impedance crosses near to electrical center. The methodology proposed presents as main advantages, beside the ability to identify the three-phase faults during power swing near to the electrical center up to δ ≤ 120°, to work in low sampling frequency and obtain the shortest response time compared to other techniques. In order to unblock the relay in the case of a short-circuit during power swing, the asymmetry coefficient of the current signal is calculated in a window of 1 cycle (60 Hz). If the asymmetry coefficient surpasses the predefined threshold, the relay is unblocked (reset of PSB function – Power Swing Blocking), allowing its operation. The methodology uses predefined thresholds through the analysis of signals of different power swing frequencies. In this work, the defined threshold is able to cover a great number of faults and to be tolerant to power swing frequencies lower than 6 Hz. The predefined threshold avoids the need for extensive studies on stability which estimate the behavior of power electrical system.
Classification of lightning stroke on transmission line using multi-resolution analysis and machine learning
 One of most important elements of Electric Power Systems (EPS) is the transmission line (TL), which is permanently under adverse conditions especially lightning strokes. At the moment, those phenomena have been the root cause of short circuits and the most important cause of mal-operation of transmission line protection relays. Thus, this paper develops the classification of lightning transient signals with and without fault. Multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is used to analyze those signals considering five mother wavelets and different decomposition levels of three phase voltages. In this manner, Spectral Energy and Machine Learning as Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine are employed to classify those signals. On the other hand, the developed work in this paper analyzes most important parameters of lightning strokes, which are essentials in producing conditions with and without fault. Results show that the methodology presents an acceptable performance.
High Voltage AC underground cable systems for power transmission – A review of the Danish experience: Part 2
 This paper is a second of two presenting a review of research results in underground cable transmission obtained by the Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University ET/AAU and Danish TSO Energinet.dk within the last six years. The main core of the results are obtained by PhD students researching electrical engineering topics related to using underground cables for power transmission at EHV level and including the 420 kV level. The research topics were laid down by ET/AAU and Energinet.dk in the DANPAC (DANish Power systems with Ac Cables) research project. The main topics are discussed on the basis of 39 references published by ET/AAU and Energinet.dk. Part I of the paper explains the events that lead to the research project, reactive power compensation, modelling for transient studies, including field measurements and improvements to the existing models, and temporary overvoltages due to resonances. Part II covers transient phenomena, harmonics in cables, system modelling for different phenomena, main and backup protections in cable-based networks, online fault detection and future trends.
Incipient fault feature extraction of rolling bearings based on the MVMD and Teager energy operator
 Aiming at the problems that the incipient fault of rolling bearings is difficult to recognize and the number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by variational mode decomposition (VMD) must be set in advance and can not be adaptively selected, taking full advantages of the adaptive segmentation of scale spectrum and Teager energy operator (TEO) demodulation, a new method for early fault feature extraction of rolling bearings based on the modified VMD and Teager energy operator (MVMD-TEO) is proposed. Firstly, the vibration signal of rolling bearings is analyzed by adaptive scale space spectrum segmentation to obtain the spectrum segmentation support boundary, and then the number K of IMFs decomposed by VMD is adaptively determined. Secondly, the original vibration signal is adaptively decomposed into K IMFs, and the effective IMF components are extracted based on the correlation coefficient criterion. Finally, the Teager energy spectrum of the reconstructed signal of the effective IMF components is calculated by the TEO, and then the early fault features of rolling bearings are extracted to realize the fault identification and location. Comparative experiments of the proposed method and the existing fault feature extraction method based on Local Mean Decomposition and Teager energy operator (LMD-TEO) have been implemented using experimental data-sets and a measured data-set. The results of comparative experiments in three application cases show that the presented method can achieve a fairly or slightly better performance than LMD-TEO method, and the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are proved.
Quantitative trend fault diagnosis of a rolling bearing based on Sparsogram and Lempel-Ziv
 Aiming at the misdiagnosis caused by extracting the non-fault features using Lempel-Ziv algorithm, a quantitative trend fault diagnosis method of a rolling bearing based on Sparsogram and Lempel-Ziv is proposed in this paper. The approximate linear relationships between Lempel-Ziv and the fault sizes of inner and outer races are simulated with a theoretical model of rolling bearings. Then, the fault characteristic of experimental signal of bearing inner and outer race in different severity is extracted by Sparsogram algorithm, and the frequency band is selected which reflects the fault characteristic mostly, and the Lempel-Ziv complexity index of the frequency band is calculated. This method can avoid the misdiagnosis caused by extracting non-fault features. Comparing with direct calculation of Lempel-Ziv value, the performance is much better on the quantitative diagnosis of a defective bearing. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize the quantitative trend diagnosis on defective bearings.
Energy and entropy-based feature extraction for locating fault on transmission lines by using neural network and wavelet packet decomposition
 The aim of this paper is to estimate the fault location on transmission lines quickly and accurately. The faulty current and voltage signals obtained from a simulation are decomposed by wavelet packet transform (WPT). The extracted features are applied to artificial neural network (ANN) for estimating fault location. As data sets increase in size, their analysis become more complicated and time consuming. The energy and entropy criterion are applied to wavelet packet coefficients to decrease the size of feature vectors. The test results of ANN demonstrate that the applying of energy criterion to current signals after WPT is a very powerful and reliable method for reducing data sets in size and hence estimating fault locations on transmission lines quickly and accurately.
Future power transmission: Visions, technologies and challenges
 Power transmission systems are called upon to play a crucial role in the future decarbonized, electrified and digital energy sectors, as they constitute the most effective way of distributing vast amounts of electricity from renewable energy sources to faraway locations. This paper aims at critically reviewing worldwide the regional visions, as well as existing and newer technologies involved in the development and upgrading of bulk transmission systems. The main emphasis is put on the major challenges and boundary conditions arising during the paradigm change that electric energy systems will undergo over the next half century. Recent research and pilot projects on this subject are revised, embracing effective combinations of AC and DC technologies, such as high-voltage AC transmission systems, phase-shifting transformers, flexible AC transmission systems and point-to-point and multi-terminal high-voltage DC systems. The challenges faced by this transition involve technical, economical, environmental, regulatory and social factors that will finally determine the preference for one or another technology in particular regions of the world. General recommendations and guidelines are proposed to increase the probability of success of future transmission projects, regardless of the type of technology, geographic location or particular external conditions. Several somewhat competing architectures are envisioned in this more volatile context, all together offering great possibilities to increase transmission capability while loop flows are prevented and system stability is preserved or enhanced.
Fault detection of a wheelset bearing in a high-speed train using the shock-response convolutional sparse-coding technique
 The wheelset bearing is an essential mechanical component of a high-speed train, and its fault detection is of great importance for ensuring the safety of high-speed train service. However, the strong nonlinear and non-stationary modulation characteristics of the impulses induced by bearing faults, noises and interferences make fault detection of the wheelset bearing difficult and complex. The impulses induced by bearing faults have convolutional sparse characteristics, and can be described as the convolution of shock responses and time location coefficients. This paper presents a new fault detection method based on the shock-response convolutional sparse-coding technique (SRCSCT) to resolve the two inverse problems related to convolution characteristics. One of the problems is that shock responses are learned directly from vibration signals via the shift-invariant dictionary learning (SIDL) of SRCSCT; the other is that the time location coefficients are inferred from vibration signals via shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) of SRCSCT. Shock responses can reflect the high-level structures of impulses embedded in vibration signals. Time location coefficients can be used to determine the time of impulse occurrence. The convolutions of learned shock responses and inferred corresponding time location coefficients are used to extract impulses submerged in vibration signals and are convenient for post-processing methods, such as Hilbert envelope analysis. Both the simulated signals and real vibration signals collected from a wheelset bearing test bench are used to verify the proposed method. The results show that SRCSCT not only effectively detects faults of the wheelset bearing but also accurately characterizes the fault dynamic behaviours of the bearing defects.
Optimal power flow considering fault current level constraints and fault current limiters
 The aim of this paper is to present a novel method to dispatch the active generation power properly in the power system while incorporating fault current levels as constraints for the optimization problem. Due to the limited capacity of protective devices such as circuit breakers, allocating active power without considering fault current levels can probably lead to fault currents exceeding the rating of these devices. Hence restricting the fault current levels to an allowable amount while minimizing a specified objective function seems to be necessary. In a number of cases even the appropriate allocation of active power is not able to reduce the fault current levels to the permitted amount therefore using fault current limiters (FCL) is unavoidable. In this paper also a planning scheme is presented for the location and sizing of fault current limiters and the effect of fault current limiters on the objective functions is investigated.
The Power Line Inspection Software (PoLIS): A versatile system for automating power line inspection
 A large amount of data, provided in the form of video data, is acquired during manned inspections flights of electric power lines. This data is analyzed by expert human inspectors to detect faults in the power lines infrastructure and prepare the inspection reports. This process is extremely time consuming, very expensive and prone to human error. In this paper, we present PoLIS: the Power Line Inspection Software, which has been developed with the objective of assisting the analysis of the data acquired during inspection flights. PoLIS is based on the cooperation between computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically process video sequences acquired during inspection flights, resulting in a set of representative images per electric tower which we call Key Frames. These representative images can then be used for inspection purposes, leading to a drastic reduction of the human operators’ workload. At the core of the strategy lies an electric tower detector, which is in charge of estimating the location of the towers within the images based on the combination of a sliding window search technique and a supervised classifier. The location of the tower is then tracked using a tracking-by-registration algorithm based on direct methods, estimating the position of the tower in different images. Finally, different criteria are applied for defining whether the image corresponds to a Key Frame image or not. Extensive evaluation of the proposed strategy is conducted using videos acquired during manned helicopter inspections. The videos constituting this database contain several thousand frames representing both medium and high voltage power transmission lines in the infra-red (IR) and visible spectra. The obtained results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the large amount of data present in the inspection videos to a few Key Frames for each tower. It is also demonstrated that the learning-based approach proposed in PoLIS is appropriate for detecting electric towers, a process which is made faster and more robust by coupling it with a tower tracking algorithm. A Graphical User Interface allowing the application of PoLIS to user-provided videos is also presented in this paper, illustrating the whole process and the automated generation of an inspection report.
Microstructures imply cataclasis and authigenic mineral formation control geomechanical properties of New Zealand's Alpine Fault
 The Alpine Fault is capable of generating large (MW > 8) earthquakes and is the main geohazard on South Island, NZ, and late in its 250–291-year seismic cycle. To minimize its hazard potential, it is indispensable to identify and understand the processes influencing the geomechanical behavior and strength-evolution of the fault. High-resolution microstructural, mineralogical and geochemical analyses of the Alpine Fault's core demonstrate wall rock fragmentation, assisted by mineral dissolution, and cementation resulting in the formation of a fine-grained principal slip zone (PSZ). A complex network of anastomosing and mutually cross-cutting calcite veins implies that faulting occurred during episodes of dilation, slip and sealing. Fluid-assisted dilatancy leads to a significant volume increase accommodated by vein formation in the fault core. Undeformed euhedral chlorite crystals and calcite veins that have cut footwall gravels demonstrate that these processes occurred very close to the Earth's surface. Microstructural evidence indicates that cataclastic processes dominate the deformation and we suggest that powder lubrication and grain rolling, particularly influenced by abundant nanoparticles, play a key role in the fault core's velocity-weakening behavior rather than frictional sliding. This is further supported by the absence of smectite, which is reasonable given recently measured geothermal gradients of more than 120 °C km−1 and the impermeable nature of the PSZ, which both limit the growth of this phase and restrict its stability to shallow depths. Our observations demonstrate that high-temperature fluids can influence authigenic mineral formation and thus control the fault's geomechanical behavior and the cyclic evolution of its strength.
A novel method for locating faults on distribution systems
 Accurate location of faults in an electric power distribution system is important in maintaining system reliability. Diverse methods have been proposed in the past, which usually have different assumptions and thus are applicable to specific circumstances. This paper attempts to put forth a novel, general fault location method that is applicable to distribution networks with unbalances and multi-sources by employing voltages and currents at the local substation. The method considers feeder shunt capacitances and is applicable to both overhead and underground networks. The method does not require the fault type to be known, and is applicable to any type of faults. The method is based on bus impedance matrix that enables the establishment of the equations governing the relationship of the measurements and the fault location. Evaluation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness with respect to potential measurement errors and load variations.
An analysis of fault detection strategies in wireless sensor networks
 Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a key technology which is used in many safety critical applications. The sensors in wireless sensor network have to be deployed in hostile, harsh and unattended environments for long periods of time. This creates a great challenge in providing a good quality of service. This results in introductions of faults, sensor failures, communication failures and changes in topology. Hence, efficient fault detection techniques are required for good quality of service. In this article, we survey various fault detection techniques and provide a new taxonomy to integrate new fault detection techniques. We perform a qualitative comparison of the latest fault detection algorithms. From a qualitative analysis, we select a list of techniques that are analyzed quantitatively. We also discuss the shortcomings, advantages and future research directions for fault detection in wireless sensor networks.
A novel traveling-wave-based protection scheme for LCC-HVDC systems using Teager Energy Operator
 Line Commutated Converter (LCC) based High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology has been in operation with a high level reliability and little maintenance requirements for more than thirty years. The current-source based or classical LCC-HVDC systems are being considered for buried cable transmission as well as overhead transmission. The fault analysis and protection of LCC-HVDC system is a very important aspect in terms of power system stability. This paper proposes a novel protection scheme for LCC-HVDC systems, in which the difference between propagation processes of traveling wave under internal and external faults is used as a criterion for detection of fault incidents in HVDC transmission lines. In order to quantify and intensify this difference, Teager Energy Operator (TEO) is used which has the ability to reflect the instantaneous energy of a signal. The main feature of the proposed scheme in comparison with the existing ones is that it operates faster, since it does not require to extract any harmonic or high frequency component; moreover, a 2-ms sampling window is sufficient for its algorithm which only deals with simple calculations. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protection scheme, several fault events under different fault resistances and fault locations were simulated on a test network using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Also, the performance of the proposed scheme under real fault events was tested using four field data cases. Both simulation data and field data test results indicated that the proposed protection strategy has the ability to accurately discriminate between internal and external faults and detect the faulted pole in the bipolar systems even under high-impedance fault conditions.
Accurate fault locator for EHV transmission lines based on radial basis function neural networks
 This paper describes the design and implementation of an artificial neural networks-based fault locator for extra high voltage (EHV) transmission lines. This locator utilizes faulted voltage and current waveforms at one end of the line only. The radial basis function (RBF) networks are trained with data under a variety of fault conditions and used for fault type classification and fault location on the transmission line. The results obtained from testing of RBF networks with simulated fault data and recorded data from a 400 kV system clearly show that this technique is highly robust and very accurate. The technique takes into account all the practical limitations associated with a real system. Thereby making it possible to effectively implement an artificial intelligence (AI) based fault locator on a real system.
Online fault diagnosis and prevention expert system for dredgers
 Faults during dredging process often caused serious damages on dredging system. High maintenance costs and prolonged fault recovering process often make dredging production and profit low. An online fault diagnosis and prevention expert system that is aimed to prevent fault occurrence and to quicken the recovering process is introduced in this paper. For the complexity of fault judging and prevention process and frequently varying dynamics of dredging operations, hybrid structure and inference process are adopted in the expert system. ANNs are introduced to adapt the varying system dynamics and to predict system state. Designed expert application is also featured by online fault prevention and recovering decisions. Preliminary test has been carried out in actual engineering project and results of performance evaluation experiment are also introduced.
Fault ride-through enhancement using an enhanced field oriented control technique for converters of grid connected DFIG and STATCOM for different types of faults
 With increase in electric power demand, transmission lines were forced to operate close to its full load and due to the drastic change in weather conditions, thermal limit is increasing and the system is operating with less security margin. To meet the increased power demand, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind generation system is a better alternative. For improving power flow capability and increasing security STATCOM can be adopted. As per modern grid rules, DFIG needs to operate without losing synchronism called low voltage ride through (LVRT) during severe grid faults. Hence, an enhanced field oriented control technique (EFOC) was adopted in Rotor Side Converter of DFIG converter to improve power flow transfer and to improve dynamic and transient stability. A STATCOM is coordinated to the system for obtaining much better stability and enhanced operation during grid fault. For the EFOC technique, rotor flux reference changes its value from synchronous speed to zero during fault for injecting current at the rotor slip frequency. In this process DC-Offset component of flux is controlled, decomposition during symmetric and asymmetric faults. The offset decomposition of flux will be oscillatory in a conventional field oriented control, whereas in EFOC it was aimed to damp quickly. This paper mitigates voltage and limits surge currents to enhance the operation of DFIG during symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. The system performance with different types of faults like single line to ground, double line to ground and triple line to ground was applied and compared without and with a STATCOM occurring at the point of common coupling with fault resistance of a very small value at 0.001 Ω.
Distributed data-based fault identification and accommodation in networked process systems
 This paper presents a data-based framework for distributed actuator fault identification and accommodation in networked process systems controlled over a resource-constrained communication medium. Initially, a quasi-decentralized networked control structure is designed to stabilize the plant in the absence of faults. The structure consists of a set of local model-based control systems that communicate with one another at discrete times. An explicit characterization of the networked closed-loop stability region is obtained in terms of the update period, the accuracy of the models, and the choice of controller design parameters. To address the actuator fault identification problem, a set of local fault diagnosis agents are designed and embedded within the various subsystems. Each agent uses a moving-horizon parameter estimation scheme to estimate on-line the size and location of the local faults using the locally sampled states and the model state estimates for the interconnected units. Potential discrepancies or ambiguities in the local fault diagnosis results, which may be caused by the strong dynamic coupling between the individual subsystems and the presence of plant-model mismatch, are reconciled by means of a fault estimation confidence interval which is obtained by analyzing the networked closed-loop dynamics at update times. Once the locations and magnitudes of the actuator faults are identified, the resulting estimates are transmitted to a higher-level supervisor to select and implement a suitable fault accommodation strategy. A number of stability-preserving fault accommodation strategies are devised, including updating the post-fault models, adjusting the controllers’ parameters, or a combination of both. The selection of the appropriate fault accommodation strategy is made on the basis of the estimated fault magnitude and the characterization of the networked closed-loop stability region. Finally, the developed methodology is illustrated using a reactor–separator process example subject to both sudden and incipient control actuator faults.
A novel fast distance relay for long transmission lines
 The measuring accuracy and the measurement stability of conventional distance relay will be influenced by complex and remarkable harmonic components due to the large capacitance of the line when it is used for a long line. Correspondingly, the tripping speed will be delayed to some extent. To solve this problem, a fast distance relay for long transmission lines is presented, which is on the basis of the differential equation algorithm using π transmission line model and the theory of Equal Transfer Process of Transmission Lines (ETPTL). The shortcomings of π model differential equation algorithm due to the impact of high frequency components can be overcome by using a low-pass filter. The problem resulting from the difference between the transfer feature of the voltages used by the distance protection and that of the currents due to the transient characteristic of coupling capacitor voltage transformers (CCVT) can be solved by using virtual digital CCVT. Then, the new distance relay can trip quickly by re-structuring the voltage at the fault point and iterative calculations. A variety of ATP simulation tests show that the new relay has fast tripping speed and high reliability when applied to the long transmission lines.
Spare optimistic based on improved ADMM and the minimum entropy de-convolution for the early weak fault diagnosis of bearings in marine systems
 In the marine systems, engines represent the most important part of ships, the probability of the bearings fault is the highest in the engines, so in the bearing vibration analysis, early weak fault detection is very important for long term monitoring. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the early weak fault diagnosis of bearing. Firstly, we should improve the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), structure of the traditional ADMM is changed, and then the improved ADMM is applied to the compressed sensing (CS) theory, which realizes the sparse optimization of bearing signal for a mount of data. After the sparse signal is reconstructed, the calculated signal is restored with the minimum entropy de-convolution (MED) to get clear fault information. Finally we adopt the sample entropy. Morphological mean square amplitude and the root mean square (RMS) to find the early fault diagnosis of bearing respectively, at the same time, we plot the Boxplot comparison chart to find the best of the three indicators. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can effectively identify the early weak fault diagnosis.

In situ stress heterogeneity in a highly developed strike-slip fault zone and its effect on the distribution of tight gases: A 3D finite element simulation study
 Strike-slip fault zones are an important type of structure formed during continental orogenic events. Exploring the influence of strike-slip faults on the distribution of natural gas by using the 3D finite element method (FEM) is a frontier in the field of geoscience. In this paper, the effects of strike-slip faults on the heterogeneity of in situ stress and reservoir quality were systematically studied in a shallow commercial coalbed methane reservoir in the Shanxi Formation in the southern Qinshui Basin. Systematic 3D FEM modeling and in situ stress evaluation of a highly developed strike-slip fault zone were conducted. The results indicate that the simulated in situ stress distributions of σH, σh and σv in the target layer present ranges of 10–55 MPa, 3–23 MPa and 5–30 MPa, respectively, which are consistent with acoustic emission and hydraulic fracturing measurements. Along the strike-slip faults, the distribution of horizontal in situ stress is mainly affected by the fault length and vertical throw. The stress magnitude differs greatly between the two sides of a given strike-slip fault, affecting the compaction degree and petrophysical properties of the gas-bearing reservoir on both sides of the fault. Along the strike of a given strike-slip fault, the minimum horizontal in situ stress exhibits distinct segmentation characteristics, which affect the distribution of wells with a higher and lower yields. For the 2 s-order faults (the Sitou and Houchengyao faults), wells with a higher gas production capacity are typically located on the northwestern side of the faults. In the middle and southern sections of the Sitou-Houchengyao strike-slip fault zone, both highly concentrated faults and large-scale opening faults (basement and surface faults) produce greater stress concentrations, and the gas production capacity of the gas wells in these areas is poor. When the main strike direction of the faults is consistent with the loading direction of the boundary stress, the stress concentration is relatively low; whereas, the stress concentration increases as the angle between the main fault strike and the loading direction increases. The shear stress of the target layer is characterized by clockwise rotation, which is an important control on the stress heterogeneity of the strike-slip faults in the study area.
IM2DCA: Immune mechanism based multipath decoupling connectivity algorithm with fault tolerance under coverage optimization in wireless sensor networks
 Transmission stability and reliability are important metrics in wireless sensor networks which brings great challenges to the study and application. Coverage issue has great relationship with reliable packets transmission which lays foundation for improving the performance of fault tolerance due to characteristics of network itself and working scenario. Immune mechanism based multipath decoupling connectivity algorithm with fault tolerance under coverage optimization (IM2DCA) is presented which includes maximum immune coverage algorithm (MICA) and immune multipath of parallel decoupling algorithm (IMPDA). MICA adopts the immune mechanism to optimize the nodes deployment and gets the maximum coverage laying the foundation for multipath establishment in the network scenario deployed with static and mobile sensor nodes. IMPDA adopts the immune mechanism to establish multiple paths from the source node to the destination node to improve the reliable transmission. Nodes decoupling is presented in the process of multipath establishment to lower the coupling degree of multipath joint model. It tries to make the joint model become the disjoint model or partly joint multipaths by lowering the importance degree of joint nodes to improve the performance of fault tolerance when fault nodes exist. Performance is analyzed through the established mathematical model in which transmission robustness and fault tolerance are analyzed. Simulation shows that the proposed IM2DCA can get the optimal network coverage with the conditional constraint. Under this scenario of optimized coverage, fault tolerance and effectiveness are proved through the optimization of multiple decoupled paths from the source node to the destination node based on the immune mechanism. IM2DCA improves the stability and reliability of wireless sensor networks via comparing it with representative works.
Fault-tolerant cooperative control in an offshore wind farm using model-free and model-based fault detection and diagnosis approaches
 Given the importance of reliability and availability in wind farms, this paper focuses on the development of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control schemes in a cooperative framework (referred to as active fault-tolerant cooperative control) at the wind farm level against the decreasing power generation caused by turbine blade erosion and debris build-up on the blades over time. In more details, the paper presents a novel integrated fault detection and diagnosis and fault-tolerant control approach oriented to the design and development of two active fault-tolerant cooperative control schemes for an offshore wind farm. Each of the schemes employs a fault detection and diagnosis system to provide accurate and timely diagnosis information to be used in an appropriate automatic signal correction algorithm for accommodation of faults in the wind farm. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed schemes are evaluated and compared using different simulations on a high-fidelity offshore wind farm benchmark model in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises and realistic fault scenarios.
Fault-tolerant spanners in networks with symmetric directional antennas
 Let P be a set of points in the plane, each equipped with a directional antenna that covers a sector of angle α and range r. In the symmetric model of communication, two antennas u and v can communicate to each other, if and only if v lies in u's coverage area and vice versa. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fault-tolerant spanners for directional antennas, which enables us to construct communication networks that retain their connectivity and spanning ratio even if a subset of antennas are removed from the network. We show how to orient the antennas with angle α and range r to obtain a k-fault-tolerant spanner for any positive integer k. For α≥π, we show that the range 13 for the antennas is sufficient to obtain a k-fault-tolerant 3-spanner. For π/2<α<π, we show that using range 6δ+19 for δ=⌈4/|cos⁡α|⌉, one can direct antennas so that the induced communication graph is a k-fault-tolerant 7-spanner.
Transmission system wide-area back-up protection using current phasor measurements
 Zone-3 of distance relays might maloperate during stresses frequently encountered in power systems, such as power swing, load encroachment, and voltage instability. This paper proposes a new protection algorithm for discrimination between short-circuit faults and other stresses in the transmission networks. The proposed method compares the sum of currents at the predetermined buses before and after the disturbance occurrence using synchronized current phasor measurements. The faulted area and line are identified as well. The optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) is tackled using a mathematical model. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is decreasing the number of required PMUs in comparison with those of existing wide-area back-up protection schemes. In virtue of its computational speed, the proposed method can be exploited as a practical back-up protection cooperating with conventional protection schemes. The extensive simulation studies carried out on the IEEE 57-bus test system verify applicability of the proposed algorithm as a reliable back-up protection scheme for lines.
Transient analysis of inductive induced voltage between power line and nearby pipeline
 Among the available literature on electromagnetic interference between high voltage power lines and nearby pipelines, the topic of transient induced voltage on the pipelines are rarely discussed. Fault in high voltage transmission systems is usually cleared in several cycles, sometimes even before the fault current reaches the steady state. This paper proposes an analytical approach for calculating the transient induced voltage and current on a pipeline due to inductive coupling using a circuit model. A numerical example is studied to demonstrate the waveforms of transient induced voltage and current on the pipeline. Simulation results show that the transient peak of the induced voltage is greater than steady state values. Therefore, it is necessary to study the induced voltage and current during the transient period.
Decentralised fault detection, identification, and mitigation in excitation control systems
 A new intelligent, decentralised, fault detection, location identification and mitigation approach for the excitation control systems of multi-generator power grids is presented in this paper. The proposed approach detects and locates faults in basic components of the excitation systems with a high accuracy and in almost real-time using interval type 2 fuzzy set theory. Once a fault is detected and the location of the fault is identified, a mitigation action follows, where the signal out of the faulty component is automatically replaced by a stabilising signal generated by the fault mitigation system. The mitigation action ensures that the field excitation voltage (thus the terminal voltage of the affected generator) is controlled such that the affected generator and the whole system maintain their pre-fault operating condition. The high accuracy and fast response time aspects of the proposed approach are verified through case studies performed on the IEEE 30 bus test system.
Failure analysis of a welded steel pipe at Kullar fault crossing
 The seismic response of a 2200-mm-diameter welded steel pipe at strike slip Kullar fault crossing in Izmit, Kocaeli during 1999 Kocaeli earthquake is investigated. The pipe was crossing the fault-line with an angle of 55° and suffered leaks due to 3.0 m of right lateral movement of fault, which imposed compressive axial strain in the pipe. The backfill material of the trench was native soil which was non-homogenous (soft and stiff clay) with respect to fault line-soft material on the North side, stiff material on the South side. Field observations revealed two major wrinkles with finger width cracks and a minor wrinkle on the soft soil side of the fault. Large plastic strains and local folding were observed at wrinkles due to compressive strains. The case is known as one of the best documented fault crossing examples. The failure behavior of the Thames water pipe during 1999 Kocaeli earthquake is simulated by utilizing a 3D nonlinear continuum FE model. The numerical model considers contact surface at soil pipe interface and performs large deformation analyses of the pipe. The locations of wrinkles as well as axial displacements/rotations demands due to fault rupture are predicted. It is observed that once wrinkle initiates, strain in the pipe away from the wrinkle reduces after initial local buckling and additional shortening of the pipeline tends to accumulate at the wrinkle causing large plastic strains and rotation demands associated with fault rupture, an observation consistent with field observations and 2005 ALA guidelines.
Directional overcurrent and earth-fault protections for a biomass microgrid system in Malaysia
 Over-current protection is principally intended to counteract excessive current in power systems. In distribution systems in Malaysia, non-directional over-current protection is adopted because of the radial nature of the power system used. Relay typically used in distribution network are designed to cater for current flow in one direction, i.e., from transmission network to load. However, with the forecasted increase in generation from renewable sources, it is important that adequate codes are in place with regards to their integration to sub-transmission/distribution network. Distribution network dynamically changes from “passive” to “active” network. With distributed generation connected to distribution network, power flows bi-directionally. Hence, directional over-current protection is adopted along the line between the transmission grid and the distributed generation. The bi-directional flow of power also complicates the earth fault protection. This is due to the presence of the distributed generation that will cause the line near the delta side of the transformer to be still energized after the operation of earth fault relay during single-phase-to-ground-fault. This paper investigates the directional over-current and earth fault protections used to protect the microgrid (biomass generator) in Malaysia. In this study, under-voltage relays are adopted at the delta side of the transformer to fully clear the single-line-to-ground fault, which cannot be cleared by earth fault relay. Three-phase-balanced fault and single-line-to-ground-fault at all possible locations in the network have been simulated. Simulation shows good coordination and discrimination between over-current relays.
High voltage AC underground cable systems for power transmission – A review of the Danish experience, part 1
 This paper is a first of two presenting a review of research results in underground cable transmission obtained by the Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University ET/AAU and Danish TSO Energinet.dk within the last 6 years. The main core of the results are obtained by PhD students researching electrical engineering topics related to using underground cables for power transmission at EHV level and including the 420 kV level. The research topics were laid down by ET/AAU and Energinet.dk in the DANPAC (DANish Power systems with AC Cables) research project. The main topics are discussed on the basis of 39 references published by ET/AAU and Energinet.dk. Part I of the paper explains the events that lead to the research project, reactive power compensation, modelling for transient studies, including field measurements and improvements to the existing models, and temporary overvoltages due to resonances. Part II covers transient phenomena, harmonics in cables, system modelling for different phenomena, main and backup protections in cable-based networks, online fault detection and future trends.
Non-stationary vibration feature extraction method based on sparse decomposition and order tracking for gearbox fault diagnosis
 Vibration signals of gearboxes working under time-varying conditions are non-stationary, which causes difficulties to the fault diagnosis. Based on the techniques of signal sparse decomposition and order tracking, a novel method is proposed to extract fault features from non-stationary vibration signals of gearboxes. The method contains two key procedures, the quasi-steady component separation in angle domain and the impact resonance component extraction in time domain. The sparse dictionary including quasi-steady sub-dictionary and impact sub-dictionary is specifically designed according to the time-frequency characteristics of steady-type fault and impact-type fault. The former sub-dictionary consists of cosine functions and is based on the order spectrum information of angle domain signal. The latter sub-dictionary consists of the unit impulse response of multiple-degree-of-freedom vibration system whose modal parameters are self-adaptively recognized by the method of correlation filtering. An improved matching pursuit algorithm on segmental signal is designed to solve sparse coefficients and reconstruct steady-type fault components and impact-type fault components. The simulation analyses show that the proposed method is capable to process the signal with 30% speed fluctuation and −1.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in which the SNR of impact-type fault components is as low as −14.6 dB. The effectiveness is further verified by experimental tests on a fixed-shaft gearbox and a planetary gearbox.
Wavelet transform based digital protection for transmission lines
 This paper presents a high speed, computationally efficient scheme for protection of transmission lines. The relay logic consists of three parts: directional protection, fault classification and fault location. Wavelet transform is used for extracting information from the fault transients and only the first level high frequency details of the voltages and currents are used. Proposed protection logic compares the directional signals from both terminals to discriminate between faults inside and outside the zone of interest. Fault classification is achieved using local terminal current information. An estimate of the location of the faults is obtained utilizing single faulted phase current information from both terminals. The logic is deterministic and can work reliably in the presence of fault resistance, load variation and CT saturation. The validity of the proposed logic was exhaustively tested by simulating various types of faults on a four bus meshed system modeled in EMTP/ATP.
A generalized method to improve the location accuracy of the single-ended sampled data and lumped parameter model based fault locators
 The necessity for very high accuracy in fault location is generally becoming more and more important. In this paper, a new generalized algorithm which can improve the accuracy of all fault location algorithms based on the lumped parameter model and single-ended data is presented. The measured distance resulting from the lumped parameter model can be converted to the positive sequence measured impedance matching with the model. Then, the relation between real distance and positive sequence measured impedance of fault circuit based on Bergeron model can be derived according to the analysis of solid grounded faults. Then the improved algorithm resulting from the relation of real distance and measured distance can be obtained. Theoretically, the proposed algorithm is independent of shunt distributed capacitance of transmission lines. Besides, the algorithm is based on power–frequency voltages and currents, and hence high sampling rate is unnecessary. Therefore, it can be implemented in the existing protection devices easily. This paper presents the theory of the technique and the results of ATP simulation tests to demonstrate its performance.
Analysis of Polygonal Distance Protection Relay of Transmission Line Affected by SMES Device
 Because of unique advantages in rapid response and independent control of act ve and reactive power, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) device will be widely used in the power system. The SMES exchanges power with power grid in the charging and discharging process, so it may affect the performance of protection relay of transmission line, which will lead to mal-operation. Based on SMES model, the tripping characteristic of polygonal distance relay for single-machine-infinite-bus performance of polygonal distance relay with SMES. The simulation results show the measured impedance of polygonal distance relay is changed by SMES, and polygonal distance relay will make mal-operation when faults occur in the boundary of protection zone. Also an improving distance relay is proposed to solve the problem.
Fault induced rock bursts and micro-tremors – Experiences from the Gotthard Base Tunnel
 During the construction of the Faido Multifunction Station of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, a previously unknown and unanticipated major tectonical fault has been encountered. Upon completion of the advance through the fault, systematic and major rock burst events occurred in the competent Gneiss rock mass adjacent to the fault. The Swiss Earthquake Service (Schweizer Erdbebendienst – SED) observed an increase of microtremors in the vicinity of the tunnelling site, in a region where usually very low seismic activity is present. As a consequence, the seismic monitoring grid has been enhanced in the project area, allowing reliable pin-pointing of the microtremor hypocenters and examination on the interaction with the tunnel advance and the observed rock burst events. Due to the vast amount of scientific work with regard to rock burst causes, classification, prediction and mitigation, this publication deliberately abstains from trying to add yet another set of relationships and/or classification schemes. Instead, a case study is presented, with the peculiarity that excellent seismic monitoring and very well documented rock mass conditions are seamlessly available, allowing direct correlation and insight into the interaction between seismicity and strike-slip rock bursts. In addition, the results of a dynamic analysis performed in UDEC, with excitation wave data and rock mass parameters calibrated on the field measurements, are presented. They allow greater understanding of the events caused by seismicity-induced rock burst phenomena. The experiences with prediction and mitigation of rock burst are shown, leading to conclusions with regard to efficient and safe tunnelling in rock-burst prone rock masses.
An efficient fault diagnosis method for PV systems following string current
 With the elevated use of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems, efficiency improvement of PV systems has become a priority research topic nowadays. Moreover, remarkable efforts to study different PV fault diagnosis methods have been increasing to give the PV system efficiency researches an extra edge. In this study, meta-heuristic optimization techniques have been employed as a novel fault diagnosis methodology that can efficiently identify, locate and distinguish between open circuit (OC) and short circuit (SC) faults in a PV system. The diagnosis algorithm follows the string current considering the effect of non-uniform irradiance and corresponding module temperature. It has been experimented that the proposed methodology has achieved success in fault diagnosis in a physical test system and distinctly identify the fault locations and types like short circuit faults and open circuit faults in a PV string. Some well recognized algorithms like, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS) algorithm and a recently developed efficient optimization technique, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), have been used as optimizers in the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. Results and performances of these optimizers in the proposed fault diagnosis methodology have been compared and assessed for validation.
Experimental investigation of injection pressure effects on fault reactivation for CO2 storage
 Laboratory tests were conducted in a triaxial load frame with acoustic emission and transmission capability to investigate mechanisms that might be initiating the microseismicity experienced in CO2 injection operations. Although often related to reactivation of mapped faults or local fracturing due to reduced injectivity, the case of the Illinois Basin – Decatur Project is used here to illustrate the need for better understanding of what triggers microseismic events in relatively large permeability, good reservoir candidates. There, microseismicity has occurred in the CO2 storage target formation, the Mt. Simon sandstone, as well as in the underlying Precambrian basement. The microseismicity in the Mt. Simon sandstone occurred ahead of CO2 plume arrival and at relatively low injection pressure conditions, well below the fracturing pressure at the injection well. A hypothesis is suggested for the occurrence of such events in the field, whereby critically stressed planes are activated by the passage of the pressure front at injection start; these faults are small and thus not visible in the seismic survey. In order to test this hypothesis, sandstone plugs were prepared by two different methods to incorporate a fracture plane, which we attempted to reactivate by pore pressure pulses. The reactivation was successful at low pressure for a fracture created in the laboratory at reservoir conditions but was unsuccessful except at a much higher pore pressure in a saw-cut artificial fracture. The results suggest that tortuous, rough stress-induced fractures may be easier to reactivate because of the higher probability that sections are already favorably oriented with respect to critical shear stress at a low pore pressure increase. Saw-cut fractures may close completely under isotropic stress loading and may be difficult to activate unless exactly oriented with respect to critical shear stress at a low pore pressure increase. Acoustic emission accompanying fracture reactivation was also recorded and analyzed. This revealed a different event distribution energy between creating and reactivating the fracture.
MCHO – A new indicator for insulation conditions in transmission lines
 Conventionally monitoring operating conditions of a power transmission line is accomplished by periodic inspections along this line. This monitoring allows corrective maintenance by finding faults during the inspection. But in more efficient maintenance, predictive techniques that are characterized by real-time monitoring should be employed. Such predictive techniques allow for verifying the working status of the line by using normal working models to detect faults and fault models for diagnosis. This paper presents a study that used a mathematical model appropriate for application to predictive maintenance of transmission line segments at low cost, without the need for sensors distributed along the line, and presenting a new indicator of transmission line operation conditions. By tracking the leakage current of transmission lines, this model allows for estimating the current line insulation status. Once the current line insulation status is known, it is possible to compare it against other future status and verify the progress of the insulation conditions of that line. The model uses a new indicator, called MCHO, which can detect and diagnose both normal and abnormal operating conditions of a power transmission line. This new indicator is the capacitance of the harmonic frequencies of the transmission line leakage current. The model was validated through measurements obtained on a stretch of transmission line.
Locational transmission capacity reserve determination using system well-being analysis
 This paper presents a methodology to determine the locational transmission capacity reserve required to provide additional transmission transfer capability to access remote generation. The methodology is based on translating the accepted deterministic criteria into probabilistic measures using the system well-being analysis framework. The objective of utilizing system well-being analysis is to help to identify and characterize the actual system reliability concerns regarding the exclusive use of deterministic criteria, and to help to determine what the appropriate deterministic reliability criteria should be so that power utilities can adjust and expand the deterministic criteria to cope with uncertainty considerations that exist in practical power systems. An application of system well-being analysis to determine the locational transmission capacity reserve on an actual island system in Canada is illustrated in this paper.
Ground Fault Current Distribution
 The analytical and measurement procedures developed in this chapter enable the determination of the ground fault current distribution for a fault anywhere along a high-voltage or medium-voltage line performed by one three-core cable and three single-core cables and installed in urban areas. In general, the correct estimation of ground fault distribution is necessary in contemporary electric power engineering practice to obtain a correct evaluation of critical potential differences (step and touch voltages) appearing during a ground fault on a grounding system of a supplied substation. There is also the need to choose cable(s) with a metal sheath cross-section that is in accordance with real needs, or, in other words, large enough to withstand thermal strings caused by the fault currents passing through it, but not too large to cause too high expenditure in cable production and too high values of harmful circulating currents appearing in normal operation conditions.
Application of wavelet fuzzy neural network in locating single line to ground fault (SLG) in distribution lines
 This paper proposes a fault location method employing wavelet fuzzy neural network to use post-fault transient and steady-state measurements. When single line to ground fault (SLG) occurs in the distribution lines of an industrial system, the transient feature is distinct and the high frequency components in the transients can be employed to reveal fault characteristics. In this paper, wavelet transform is applied to extract fault characteristics from the fault signals. Fuzzy theory and neural network are employed to fuzzify the extracted information. Wavelet is then integrated with fuzzy neural network to form the wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN). The WFNN is most suitable for post-fault transient and steady-state signal analysis in industrial distribution power system. Analysis and simulation results illustrate that the theory and algorithm of the WFNN proposed in this paper are efficient in fault location. The WFNN can be widely applied in fault analysis of power system.
Microgrid fault detection based on wavelet transformation and Park’s vector approach
 This paper presents a new algorithm for fault detection in microgrids application. This algorithm is used in real time by applying the dq0 and wavelet transformation over local measurements. This approach consists of transforming three-phase voltage or current signals into dq0 components to analyze its behavior during faults in order to then recognize patterns that indicate the start of a fault. By filtering one of the dq0 components through the wavelet transformation, and by isolating band frequencies of interest, faults can be detected using the finite difference between samples of the filtered signal. In order to demonstrate the algorithm’s performance, we have performed an experiment on a scaled microgrid and worked with the data obtained from this simulation. This algorithm will likely impact the development of new microgrid architectures with fewer resources directed to power monitoring.
Locating lightning strikes and flashovers along overhead power transmission lines using electromagnetic time reversal
 The paper presents a method to identify the location of direct lightning strikes to overhead transmission lines and potential subsequent flashover(s). The method is based on the electromagnetic time reversal theory and relies on the use of a single measurement point to record voltage transient signals originated by a direct lightning strike either on the phase conductors or shielding wires, and possible flashovers. The measurement system is supposed to be installed on the secondary winding of the transformer located at the line feeding substation. The performance of the proposed method, applicable for different power network topologies, is validated by using different numerical simulations applied to various case studies. The paper also discusses the impact of the grounding system model, high-frequency transformer model, presence of surge arresters as well as soil electrical parameters.
Fault Diagnostics
 Fault diagnostics mainly includes fault location and fault identification. As spacecraft system structures and module compositions are becoming increasingly complex, the types of faults are also increasing. Some fault characteristics are obvious and can physically be detected; however, as most fault situations are complex, there is often no simple one-to-one correspondence between the fault symptoms and the faults. Fault diagnostics difficulties for spacecraft system are increasing due to the fuzziness, randomness and the unpredictability of fault symptoms, and the system monitoring data. System failure usually occurs in the early failure stage when the system or subsystem has not yet failed and there are no obvious fault symptoms on the system level. However, ignoring system module-level failure can lead to subsystem failure or even more serious accidents. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the fault diagnostics of the subsystem and its modules and discusses the main problems for spacecraft system fault diagnostics.
Boost inverter-based HVDC transmission system with inherent blocking capability of AC side contribution during DC side faults
 Semiconductor advancements in the past three decades have positioned the voltage source converter-based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) solution as a practical and popular alternative to its line-commutated converter high voltage DC (LCC-HVDC) counterpart. The VSC-HVDC systems offer higher flexibility and system controllability features. One of the important challenges requiring careful investigation in such systems is the protection against DC side faults. Unfortunately, the VSC is inherently defenseless against such faults (DC link short circuit or DC cable short circuit). This paper proposes an HVDC system topology, namely, the boost inverter-based HVDC system (BI-HVDC), which provides complete blocking capability between the AC grid and the DC side fault. This blocking capability limits the DC fault current level to the DC capacitor discharge current. Ratings and characteristics of the proposed system compared to other existing topologies are highlighted in this work. A simulation study is conducted to check the performance of the proposed system during normal as well as abnormal operating conditions. A comparison between the performance of the conventional 2-level VSC-HVDC and the proposed system during DC side faults is also presented. The simulation results elucidate a significant decrease in the DC fault current due to the blocking capability of the BI-HVDC system during DC side faults.
Earth wires currents calculation by tableau analysis
 The paper presents a new method to compute a phase-to-earth fault current distribution in overhead transmission line. The method is based on the tableau analysis of an unbalanced, multi-wire model of a transmission line. It allows for the calculation of current distribution in overhead earth wires along the transmission line. Additionally, it may be used to calculate currents in a tower’s earthing system as well as voltages over every tower of the transmission line. The method can be used for analysis of any type of transmission line (single circuit, double circuit and multi-circuit lines) with any number of earth wires. The calculation results may be used for complex designs of transmission line earthing systems, earth wire thermal rating selection, and the evaluation of shock hazards.
A new multiple line outage identification formulation using a sparse vector recovery technique
 This paper develops new methods to estimate the locations of transmission line outages in transmission networks. Two transmission outage models are developed based on DC and AC power flow equations and injected power changes due to line outages. The models are then generalized to include other transmission lines in addition to the outaged lines to provide a full representation of transmission networks. Three methods are developed based on the DC and AC models: Method_1 uses the DC power flow model; Method_2 uses the AC power flow model with zero line resistance; Method_3 uses the AC power flow model with line losses taken into account. A regularized least square based on ℓ1-norm minimization is developed to solve the models and estimate the locations of outages. Simulation results of the IEEE 39-, 57- and 118-bus systems verify the effectiveness of the developed methods in detecting line outage locations.
Sparsity-enhanced signal decomposition via generalized minimax-concave penalty for gearbox fault diagnosis
 Vibration signals arising from faulty gearboxes are often a mixture of the meshing component and the periodic transient component, and simultaneously contaminated by noise. Sparsity-assisted signal decomposition is an effective technique to decompose a signal into morphologically distinct components based on sparse representation and optimization. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-enhanced signal decomposition method which uses the generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty as a nonconvex regularizer to enhance sparsity in the sparse approximation compared to classical sparsity-assisted signal decomposition methods, and thus to improve the decomposition accuracy for gearbox fault diagnosis. Even though the GMC penalty itself is nonconvex, it maintains the convexity of the GMC regularized cost function to be minimized. Hence, similar to the classical L1-norm regularization methods, the global optimal solution can be guaranteed via convex optimization. Moreover, we present and validate a straight-forward way to choose transforms and set parameters for the proposed method. Through simulation studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed sparsity-enhanced signal decomposition method can effectively decompose the simulated faulty gearbox signal into the meshing component and the periodic transient component. Comparisons with the classical L1-norm regularized signal decomposition method and spectral kurtosis show that the proposed method can accurately preserve the amplitude of the periodic transient component and provide a more accurate estimation result. Experiment and engineering case studies further verify that the proposed method can accurately estimate the periodic transient component from vibration signals, which demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising tool for gearbox fault diagnosis.
General equations of lumped parameter ladder circuits and a special approach to analyzing electrical line transient states
 The presented analytical procedure gives the equations that can be named as the General Equations of Lumped Parameter Ladder Circuits. The procedure is based on representing an electrical line through its lumped parameter model, applying the principle of superposition, and summation of the finite and infinite geometric series. The developed analytical procedure results in relatively simple analytical expressions for the relationship between currents and voltages at different points of transmission line models in both transient and steady state conditions. Also, the developed analytical procedure follows one by one all the phases of the actual physical process occurring during transient states in transmission lines. As such, this procedure is convenient for determination of power frequency over-voltages during a transient state of a transmission or distribution line. As an illustration of this, the paper presents a numerical example of determination of switching over-voltage at the open end of a transmission line.
On-Line Fast Motor Fault Diagnostics Based on Fuzzy Neural Networks
 An on-line method was developed to improve diagnostic accuracy and speed for analyzing running motors on site. On-line pre-measured data was used as the basis for constructing the membership functions used in a fuzzy neural network (FNN) as well as for network training to reduce the effects of various static factors, such as unbalanced input power and asymmetrical motor alignment, to increase accuracy. The preprocessed data and fuzzy logic were used to find the nonlinear mapping relationships between the data and the conclusions. The FNN was then constructed to carry motor fault diagnostics, which gives fast accurate diagnostics. The on-line fast motor fault diagnostics clearly indicate the fault type, location, and severity in running motors. This approach can also be extended to other applications.
Persistent rupture terminations at a restraining bend from slip rates on the eastern Altyn Tagh fault
 Restraining double-bends along strike-slip faults inhibit or permit throughgoing ruptures depending on bend angle, length, and prior rupture history. Modeling predicts that for mature strike-slip faults in a regional stress regime characterized by simple shear, a restraining bend of >18° and >4 km length impedes propagating rupture. Indeed, natural evidence shows that the most recent rupture(s) of the Xorkoli section (90°–93°E) of the eastern Altyn Tagh fault (ATF) ended at large restraining bends. However, when multiple seismic cycles are considered in numerical dynamic rupture modeling, heterogeneous residual stresses enable some ruptures to propagate further, modulating whether the bends persistently serve as barriers. These models remain to be tested using observations of the cumulative effects of multiple earthquake ruptures. Here we investigate whether a large restraining double-bend on the ATF serves consistently as a barrier to rupture by measuring long-term slip rates around the terminus of its most recent surface rupture at the Aksay bend. Our results show a W—E decline in slip as the SATF enters the bend, as would be predicted from repeated rupture terminations there. Prior work demonstrated no Holocene slip on the central, most misoriented portion of the bend, while 19–79 m offsets suggest that multiple ruptures have occurred on the west side of the bend during the Holocene. Thus we conclude the gradient in the SATF's slip rate results from the repeated termination of earthquake ruptures there. However, a finite slip rate east of the bend represents the transmission of some slip, suggesting that a small fraction of ruptures may fully traverse or jump the double-bend. This agreement between natural observations of slip accumulation and multi-cycle models of fault rupture enables us to translate observed slip rates into insight about the dynamic rupture process of individual earthquakes as they encounter geometric complexities along faults.
Analysis of overvoltages in overhead ground wires of extra high voltage (EHV) power transmission line under single-phase-to-ground faults
 Overhead ground wires (GW) of extra high voltage (EHV) power transmission lines, apart from lightning-induced overvoltage protection are frequently used for carrier-current communication. In this case the ground wires are suspended on insulators, the dielectric strength of which should be sufficient for the line operational conditions. The insulation level is defined from the condition of the single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault, thus insulator protecting spark gaps should not be flashed-over during such conditions — in order to maintain continuity of the communication channel along the line. Overvoltages during such faults depend on many parameters such as fault place, fault angle, pre-fault load etc. Therefore, designers should investigate the problem for determination of the worst-case scenario. In this paper, dependence of the overvoltages on 750 kV power transmission line ground wires upon the SLG fault place and pre-fault load of the line in transient and steady states is investigated. The analysis was performed by using dynamic arc model incorporated into the EMTP program. The provided simulations show that adequately introduced primary and secondary arc models are decisive factors for an accurate simulation of the electromagnetic phenomena in the EHV transmission lines during an arc crossing-over (here the primary arc plays an important role) and during so called dead-time, when the secondary arc takes place. This paper gives some recommendations for the insulator strings coordination in the 750 kV earth wires on the basis of computer simulation results.
On Seismicity and Structural Style of Oceanic Transform Faults: A Field Geological Perspective From the Troodos Ophiolite, Cyprus
 Aseismic creep accommodates the majority of displacements along active oceanic transform faults, within their thermally defined seismogenic zones. The significant earthquakes that do occur are near periodic, and repeat in nearly constant locations. Neither of these observations is explained by the current models that infer an olivine-dominated rheology and a thermally controlled seismogenic zone. In this contribution, we review the geological observations from the exhumed Southern Troodos Transform Fault Zone of Cyprus, and discuss their implications for seismogenesis at modern oceanic transform faults. In crustal level rocks, displacement was accommodated on discrete faults and in broad breccia zones, whereas at mantle levels the dominant structures are serpentinite mélanges overprinting rare and volumetrically minor, ductilely deformed peridotites. We speculate that the seismic style of crustal level faults depends on whether slip is localized or distributed over a broad zone that must dilate during shear. At mantle levels, we highlight that the dominant deforming material is serpentinite, at least when—as in the case of Troodos—sufficient hydration has taken place. Our observations and inferences imply that transform fault seismicity depends on time-, strain-, and permeability-dependent processes, and is governed by the geological complexity at a range of scales.
Fault tolerant adaptive parallel and distributed simulation through functional replication
 This paper presents FT-GAIA, a software-based fault-tolerant parallel and distributed simulation middleware. FT-GAIA has being designed to reliably handle Parallel And Distributed Simulation (PADS) models, which are needed to properly simulate and analyze complex systems arising in any kind of scientific or engineering field. PADS takes advantage of multiple execution units run in multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. However, large computing systems, such as HPC systems that include hundreds of thousands of computing nodes, have to handle frequent failures of some components. To cope with this issue, FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes. Moreover, FT-GAIA offers some protection against Byzantine failures, since interaction messages among the simulated entities are replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard corrupted messages. Results from an analytical model and from an experimental evaluation show that FT-GAIA provides a high degree of fault tolerance, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the execution units.
Thermal Fault-Detection method and analysis of peripheral systems for large battery packs
 Complex electrical systems such as battery packs are pushed further to comply with the continuously rising demands for power, energy and safety. This triangle of requirements needs to be optimized in all three directions, but has to be well balanced using as much information about the battery’s parameters, such as temperature. Today’s battery packs lack of gapless temperature acquisition due to a limited sensor count. To increase the temperature information count and herewith the safety, additional sensors would need to be installed, which is rather expensive. A different approach is provided in this paper: Already existent wire harnesses are put into a secondary use to acquire thermal hotspots. Additionally, the proposed method allows to localize the thermal event which leads to a more detailed knowledge of battery pack’s thermal situation. By accomplishing a gapless temperature supervision, the mentioned requirement triangle can be further optimized to match future application demands.
A strategy for protection of high voltage systems using resistive superconducting fault current limiters
 This work describes an use of a resistive superconducting fault current limiter (R-SFCL) device based on second generation high temperature superconductors tapes (2G tapes), using a thermal-electrical analogy method to represent heat exchanges. The considered SFCL is supposed to be inserted into the coupling point of a new generation unit to a 12 bar CIGRE benchmark transmission system. The strategy is the investigation of the limitation performance in the high voltage grid by connecting the SFCL at medium voltage grid. We evaluated the performance of the SFCL through the analysis of two cases of faults in different points of the system. Results show that a correct design of the SFCL may effectively limit the contribution of fault currents in the high voltage side. Additionally, it was possible to investigate the behavior of the device internal variables such as the temperature of the superconducting layers for the different cases studied.
Fault analysis of solar photovoltaic penetrated distribution systems including overcurrent relays in presence of fluctuations
 Intermittence from solar photovoltaic (PV) source can deteriorate overcurrent relays (OCRs) response to fault. This paper proposes a method for fault analysis with OCRs consideration to discuss relays faults currents fluctuations in time against PV fluctuations. The simulated PV fluctuations are short time dynamic high and low irradiations fluctuations and PV connection and disconnection based PV-dominated feeders. Two distribution systems (DSs) based accurate PV systems are modeled separately with and without Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) for the purpose of proposed method. Series and parallels PV modules are arranged to model accurate 6.5 kV PV farm power. Two level three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI), DC-DC boost converter and LCL filter are applied for each PV system. Precise detailed control strategies are implemented in PSCAD software. This paper proposed method complies with congestion which is frequently avoided in literature. The results discussions based proposed method clarified PV fluctuations scenarios impacts on OCRs dynamic fault currents profiles in presence and absence of BESS and clearly revealed and argued related important findings. In addition, OCRs performance is shortly analyzed based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently coded in Matlab. The obtained results could be very profitable to power system relaying operators to handle protection challenges with PV power fluctuations.
Fault Analysis, Detection and Estimation for a Microgrid via H2/H∞LPV Observers
 This works addresses the problem of Fault Detection and Diagnosis and provides a solution based on the use of multiple Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) extended-state observers coupled with simple search algorithm. This methodology is applied to a Grid-Connected Hybrid Power Plant, with different renewable sources, such as photovoltaic panels, wind power generation and the use of biomass. This plant might present different possible faults, that can lead it not to comply to its operational constraints, such as communication problems, valve malfunctions, vapor leakages and others. All these possible faults are carefully categorized based on empirical information from real plants in Brazil. The Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) system designed aims to estimate and categorize these faults and, to do so, the proposed LPV observers are derived from LMI computation of the mixed H2/H∞ norm minimization, in such a way to reduce the effect of noise and external disturbances upon the fault estimation. Through high-fidelity simulations, the benefits of the presented method is discussed.
Single-ended travelling wave-based protection scheme for double-circuit transmission lines
 In this paper, a new single-ended travelling wave-based protection scheme for double-circuit lines is proposed. It is developed to operate in parallel with traditional phasor-based protective relays and is able to accelerate the tripping time in most fault scenarios. The proposed method considers the propagation of travelling waves in a loop formed by the faulted and healthy line circuits. Disturbances within a given protected zone can be reliably detected according to the amplitude, polarity and time difference between the arrival instants of travelling waves that reach the monitored terminal. Also, the accumulative cross-differential current deviation is used to confirm internal faults, distinguishing them from other non-fault events. From the analysis of massive digital fault simulations and actual field records, it is attested that the proposed protection is feasible and effective.
Blinded Comparison between an In-Air Reverberation Method and an Electronic Probe Tester in the Detection of Ultrasound Probe Faults
 The aim of this study was to perform a blinded trial, comparing the results of a visual inspection of the in-air reverberation pattern with the results of an electronic probe tester in detecting ultrasound probe faults. Sixty-two probes were tested. A total of 28 faults were found, 3 only by in-air reverberation assessment and 2 only by the electronic probe tester. The electronic probe tester provided additional information regarding the location of the fault in 74% of the cases in which both methods detected a fault. It is possible to detect the majority of probe faults by visual inspection and in-air reverberation assessment. The latter provides an excellent first-line test, easily performed on a daily basis by equipment users. An electronic probe tester is required if detailed evaluation of faults is necessary.
A review on different pipeline fault detection methods
 Pipeline faults like leakage and blockage always create problem for engineers. Detection of exact fault quantity and its location is necessary for smooth functioning of a plant or industry and safety of the environment. In this paper brief discussion is made on various pipeline fault detection methods viz. Vibration analysis, Pulse echo methodology, Acoustic techniques, Negative pressure wave based leak detection system, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based pipeline leakage detection, Interferometric fibre sensor based leak detection, Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM), etc. In this paper merit and demerits of all methods are discussed. It is found that these methods have been applied for specific fluids like oil, gas and water, for different layout patterns like straight and zigzag, for various lengths of pipeline like short and long and also depending on various operating conditions. Therefore, a comparison among all methods has been done based on their applicability. Among all fault detection methods, Acoustic reflectometry is found most suitable because of its proficiency to identify blockages and leakage in pipe as small as 1% of its diameter. Moreover this method is economical and applicable for straight, zigzag and long, short length pipes for low, medium and high density fluid.
Nominal features-based class specific learning model for fault diagnosis in industrial applications
 Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is an initial stage of the real-time fault diagnosis in industrial applications. The increase in a number of faults will increase the size of the features that limit the accuracy. This paper proposes the suitable technique to extract the relevant features and classify the faults accordingly. Initially, the preprocessing removes the unfilled entries in the fault dataset (after the data collected from the sensor). Then, the Minimal Relevant Feature extraction predicts the features that correspond to the six types of fault classes. The minimum and maximum ranges of voltage, current, vibrations and speed due to the above classes regarded as the features. The modified objective function for class-specific support vector machine (CS-SVM) classifies the fault classes which highly contribute to the early diagnosis. The relevant feature prior to the Classification increases the accuracy effectively. The variations of voltage, current, and motor speed according to the injection of vibration faults from the motor bearings determine the impacts effectively. The comparison between the proposed Minimal Relevant Features-based Classification (MRFC) with existing SVM regarding the accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity and coefficient (Jaccard, Dice and Kappa) confirms the effectiveness of proposed MRFC in earlier fault diagnosis in industrial applications.
A new technique for improving stability of distributed synchronous generators during temporary faults in a distribution network
 A system is developed for performing coordinated control of operation of distributed synchronous generators during transients caused by disturbances due to faults in the interconnecting network. For this purpose a braking resistor is used where excess electrical energy is dissipated, thus preventing over-speeding and loss of synchronism of the machine during transient processes caused by temporary faults and actions of the protection system together with the system for automatic reclose of the line. In addition to controlling the operation of the braking resistor, the proposed system performs a coordinated control of the excitation of the generator. The coordinated control of the braking resistor and excitation voltage of the generator provides a good fault ride through capacity of the machine even during faults when the generator stays in the island operating mode for some time. The functionality and practical applicability of the developed system have been tested by dynamic simulations carried out on a real model of a hydro-aggregate incorporating a synchronous machine and with real parameters of a distribution network. The simulations were performed by using program package DIgSILENT PowerFactory.
Corridors of crestal and radial faults linking salt diapirs in the Espírito Santo Basin, SE Brazil
 This work uses high-quality 3D seismic data to assess the geometry of fault families around salt diapirs in SE Brazil (Espírito Santo Basin). It aims at evaluating the timings of fault growth, and suggests the generation of corridors for fluid migration linking discrete salt diapirs. Three salt diapirs, one salt ridge, and five fault families were identified based on their geometry and relative locations. Displacement-length (D-x) plots, Throw-depth (T-z) data and structural maps indicate that faults consist of multiple segments that were reactivated by dip-linkage following a preferential NE–SW direction. This style of reactivation and linkage is distinct from other sectors of the Espírito Santo Basin where the preferential mode of reactivation is by upwards vertical propagation. Reactivation of faults above a Mid-Eocene unconformity is also scarce in the study area. Conversely, two halokinetic episodes dated as Cretaceous and Paleogene are interpreted below a Mid-Eocene unconformity. This work is important as it recognises the juxtaposition of permeable strata across faults as marking the generation of fault corridors linking adjacent salt structures. In such a setting, fault modelling shows that fluid will migrate towards the shallower salt structures along the fault corridors first identified in this work.
Coordination of overcurrent protection relays in networks with superconducting fault current limiters
 The paper concerns coordination of overcurrent (OC) protection relays in power networks with superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL). At the beginning, information about designed SFCL and conditions that ensure overcurrent protection coordination are presented. Next, settings of the overcurrent relays were determined for a sample network with SFCL model installed. The considered HV/MV power system was modeled in the ATP/EMTP software and the effects of OC relays coordination was analyzed. At the end, conclusions from conducted studies and resulting guidelines for protection coordination are provided.
Calculation of overvoltage on nearby underground metal pipeline due to the lightning strike on UHV AC transmission line tower
 Making use of EMTP, the transient simulation of the currents along the towers and ground wires is performed when the lightning strikes the tower of the power transmission line. The investigation shows that the currents along the towers and ground wires dramatically decrease and can be ignored after 5 spans. And the effect on them for different impulse ground impedances, lightning current injection locations, tower spans, lightning wave impedances and so on are obtained when lightning strike on tower. With the help of Fourier transform, the method of moment is adopted to calculate the transient coating stress voltage of the pipeline and total electric field in the earth when the underground pipeline runs parallel to or crosses the power transmission line. The approximate formulas of the maximum coating stress voltage along the pipeline are proposed for the situation of crossing, which involve the lightning current, soil resistivity, pipeline models, tower grounding structure sizes and separation distance between the pipeline and tower grounding structure. Then, the proposed method can be used to evaluate the safety distance between the pipeline and tower grounding structure with the lightning electrical strength of the anti-corrosion coating of the pipeline. Eventually, if actual distance is less than the calculated value, modeling and analysis of protection measures in the pipeline can be carried out to protect the coating.
Fast S-transform based distance relaying in transmission line
 The paper presents distance relaying of transmission line using Fast S-transform (FST). Basically distance relaying needs a faster and accurate phasor estimation of the fault current and voltage signals, which are used to compute apparent impedance for issuing the tripping signal in case of faulty situations. Originally developed conventional S-transform is an invertible time–frequency spectral localization technique that combines elements of wavelet and short-time Fourier transforms. However, the computational burden (processing time) of conventional S-transform is high and thus, not suitable for on-line applications such as digital protection of transmission lines. However, recent development of FST reduces the computational burden by utilizing downsampling. The FST is found to be accurate and faster compared to conventional S-transform while estimating the phasor and computing impedance trajectory. The accuracy in estimation with high DC off-set and performance in noisy environment ensures the robustness of the FST for relaying applications. The results from extensive study indicate that the FST can suitably replace the existing DFT based algorithm for on-line digital distance relaying task in large power transmission network.
Evaluating Fault Tree by means of Colored Petri nets to analyze the railway system dependability
 Railway system is a safety critical and time-related system, the system’s states and time parameters can be used to carry out the dependability and hazard analysis. Fault Tree is widely recognized as a standard evaluating method. However, restricted by the commercial products, the Fault Tree is limited to assess dynamic systems with event-repair operations and time-related attributions. Additionally, it is difficult to incorporate non-linear relationships such as feedback. The quality assurance for fault trees and events trees is mainly carried out by peer review. Combinatory limitations are encountered when modeling complex events with classical methods. Thus, this paper proposes a new method to represent and extend the Fault Tree in Colored Petri nets. Due to large calculation capabilities of CPNs, these limitations can be able to overcome. Additionally, it can be reused for customizations. The accuracy of the approach is verified by using model-based simulation and state space analysis. The performance and benefits of the new approach are demonstrated by investigating train to train collision failure models. To increase the safety demanding needs of railway transportation, we propose a new train movement authority plus system (MA+) in this paper. With the assistance of the wireless communication technology, MA+ can detect the condition of approaching switches and encountering trains within a certain range. The results indicate that the new MA+ can reduce the risk of train head to tail collisions. What is more, the new evaluation method can offer much more essential information, which involves maintenance components, model correctness verification, time factors, and mathematical calculation together, than the traditional Fault Tree Analysis.
Concealed fault analysis based on the CT projection matrix
 This paper proposes the concept of projection curves based on the theory of CT image reconstruction to probe the internal structure of the working panel prior to formal mining of the working panel. As well as reducing costs, this method provides safe and efficient excavation of the working panel. According to the results of the numerical model and the actual working panel, the new method has been proven to be accurate in detecting the location of the fault that extends into the face. Concealed faults of the internal working panel, as well as the start and end points of the fault, can be detected by this method. Engineering practice has proven that the method is highly reliable, has a highly decisive impact on faults for coal mining, and can be used to guide the safe mining of the working panel.
Sliding window assessment for sensor fault model-based diagnosis in inland waterways
 The Cuinchy-Fontinettes reach belongs to the inland waterways in the north of France. It is equipped with limnimeters that measure water level data for the management of the water resources. These data can be corrupted by constant or intermittent faults. Hence, it is necessary to detect and localize these faults in order to guarantee efficient management actions. The proposed fault diagnosis method is based on the analysis of the parameters of a grey-box model. These parameters are obtained from available real data by using a sliding window, whose size is determined based on the level of excitation of input signals. Then, several scenarios involving constant and intermittent faults are proposed to discuss the performance of the proposed FDI approach as well as the effect of the sliding window size on the results.
Microscopic features of quartz and clay particles from fault gouges and infilled fractures in granite: Discriminating between active and inactive faulting
 To assist in identifying faults that have a significant potential for displacement at or near the ground surface, we carried out in-depth investigations on fault gouges and a fracture infilled with clay (clay vein) in the Kojaku Granite on the Tsuruga Peninsula, central Japan. We sampled several fault gouges at different stages of evolutions and clay-rich infilling of a fracture with no evidence of offset. Based on our field observations, gouge in an active fault is characterized by 1) stacked layers of different colors made up of comminuted fragments and clays, and 2) injection of the fragments and clays from the gouge into the surrounding rocks, indicating an accumulation of seismic-induced shearing. Our thin-section observations and X-ray diffraction analyses show that all our samples are similar in the degree of fragmentation and mineral composition, and because of this, our study became focused mainly on microscopic features using laser diffraction particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We identified the mineralogical and textural characteristics of the samples in order to improve our ability to discriminate between active and inactive faulting. Particle size distribution analysis showed that the gouge in the active fault contains the greatest abundance of finer particles due to multiple slip events, which contrasts with the clay-rich infilling of a fracture. SEM examination of the quartz particles showed that the gouge in the active fault contains more particles that have retained sharp and smooth crystal surfaces (formed by fracturing) than do either the gouges in minor faults (that show no evidence of recent shear) or the clay-rich infilling of a fracture. In contrast, TEM observations of very fine clay minerals (approximately < 0.2 μm) showed that the minerals in the gouge from the active fault are abraded and corroded to an equal or higher degree than the minerals in gouges from minor faults with no recent shear. Clay minerals in the fault gouges underwent abrasion and dissolution due to repeated fault activity, whereas relatively hard quartz particles that are wrapped with relatively soft clays have been less affected by abrasion. Repeated fault activity involving granite fragmentation in a fault zone results in the continual addition of new quartz particles from the granite, and these particles exhibit sharp and smooth crystal surfaces. Based on the results of the multiple methods described above, we show that examination of the surface textures of quartz particles is a useful tool for understanding the differences between active and inactive faulting in granitic rocks.
Distribution drop fiber in-service fault management in enhanced EPON system
 Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) is considered one of the best candidates for next-generation optical access solutions. Practical and cost-effective survivability and maintenance mechanisms are therefore becoming the key issues for continued development of viable EPON solutions. In addition, 80% of faults occur within the first/last mile. Therefore, in this paper, we propose in-service integrated fault management mechanisms at the distribution drop fibers (DDFs) in EPON. The proposed mechanisms can automatically detect and identify any signal anomalies and DDF faults in the physical layer, thus decreasing the operating expense (OpEx) to be incurred in sending off technicians in the field. The mechanisms are two-fold: pre-fault and post-fault. In the pre-fault mechanism, we use optical receiver type/length/value (TLV) code as a sensor for triggering the embedded miniaturized optical-time-domain reflectometry (OTDR), placed at optical network units (ONUs). This mechanism observes and measures the abnormal condition and reports it to the optical line terminal (OLT), via restoration plan fiber link. In post-fault mechanism, we divide the ONUs into several restoration groups (RGs) to guarantee upstream transmission of the affected ONUs. Lastly, the fault dynamic bandwidth allocation for fault management, referred as FDBA, is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms can withstand DDF faults without any significant impact on the overall quality of service (QoS) performance, in terms of mean packet delay, queue length, system throughput, and packet loss.
Data-driven Method in Detecting CAN Network Intermittent Connection Fault
 The reliability of the network is critical to the performance and the safety of manufacturing systems. Controller area network (CAN) has been widely adopted due to its electrical robustness, low price and deterministic access delay. However, there are numerous factors that can sabotage the reliability of networks. The fault at intermittent connection (IC) of the network cable is one of the major issues. When multiple IC faults occur in the network, especially on the trunk cable, the troubleshooting for these IC faults becomes very difficult. IC problems may result in delayed or deceptive information of machines and production status which can severely impede manufacturing normal operation. To improve the network reliability and communication quality, a novel data-driven fault detection methodology is developed in this paper, which can locate multiple IC faults in the network. By analyzing IC induced network errors, the characteristics of error frames can be captured. The information extracted from the error frames is utilized to filter the network error and facilitate a two-level procedure to identify the IC faults. Case studies are performed to demonstrate the proposed method. This research provides a multiple IC faults location method which is accurate and easy to implement.
Source-location privacy full protection in wireless sensor networks
 In many scenarios, the locations of monitored targets need to be reported by source nodes, but should remain anonymous in wireless sensor networks. Source-location privacy protection is an important research topic. Many schemes have been designed based on different adversarial models. In this paper, a scheme named Source-location Privacy Full Protection (SPFP) is proposed. We consider a more practical adversarial model — a smart adversary — which is a combination of global and local models. To defend against the new adversary, first, we design a lightweight message sharing scheme that is based on congruence equations. Second, each message is mapped to a set of shares. The short lengths of the shares enable them to be processed and transmitted in an energy-efficient manner. The correctness and security of the scheme are proved in theorems. In addition, the proposed message sharing scheme can tolerate the unreliability of the sensor nodes and provides a more reliable data transmission mechanism for networks. Third, the source node constructs a cloud around itself based on the shares and dummy packages to hide its location. The radio actions of the nodes in the cloud are carefully arranged to conceal the real shares from the adversaries and render the nodes in the cloud statistically indistinguishable. Last, a random routing algorithm is seamlessly integrated into our scheme to deliver the real shares from the fake source nodes to the sink node, where the original message is reconstructed based on the received shares. The simulation results illustrate that our scheme can provide adequate protection of source-location privacy with a slight increase in energy consumption.
Windbreaks working as barriers to high speed winds for protection of electric power transmission lines and towers
 The effects of bad weather conditions on transmission lines associated with high speed wind events have concerned not only industry players, but also the government and consumers of electricity. Recently in Brazil, events of this nature have caused large-scale disruptions in the supply of electricity, resulting in direct economic losses throughout the chain of production and consumption. This paper aimed to propose a methodology for reduction of the occurrence of faults in transmission lines and towers related to high speed wind events and gusts, including a safety analysis and recommendation for corrective maintenance. Results are based on a R&D project, with its development including: a) the identification of transmission line faults occurred in Brazil, with wind events as the main underlying cause; b) the description of wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling results aiming at exploring the effectiveness of windbreaks (tree rows alongside the transmission line corridors) as a mean to reduce wind impacts against towers and transmission lines; c) recommendations to reduce the risks of collapse of the transmission infrastructure of large-scale electric power systems which are exposed to extreme weather events. The research development was supported by State Grid Brazil, as a part of their R&D investment in its subsidiary company, Porto Primavera Transmissora de Energia (PPTE) during the years of 2014 and 2015.
Fault-resilient localization for underwater sensor networks
 Localization is one of the critical issues in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) on grounds of environmental characteristics, mobility of sensor nodes, and lack of global positioning system (GPS) services. Mobility modeling and fault tolerance with respect to underwater characteristics are extremely difficult. In this energy constraint network, an adaptive localization scheme with minimum communication and GPS support is required. We propose a fault-resilient localization scheme, which provides good localization accuracy with minimal communication overhead. To resile from an anchor node failure, a sensor node predicts its position by learning the mobility behavior of its neighbors using multiple linear regression. Therefore, the data dissemination process can continue even after an unexpected case of anchor node failure. We simulate the network and analyze the localization accuracy. Several experiments with different test cases are conducted to analyze the validity of the location prediction system. Experimental results show that the last 10 location information from three immediate neighbors are adequate for accurate prediction and the localization scheme is well suited for medium-range UWSNs.
Fault detection and monitoring systems for photovoltaic installations: A review
 As any energy production system, photovoltaic (PV) installations have to be monitored to enhance system performances and to early detect failures for more reliability. There are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies based on the output of the plant and its nature. Monitoring can be performed locally on site or remotely. It measures production, focuses also on verification and follow-up of converter and communication devices' effective operation. Up to now, some faults diagnosis methods for PV components and systems have been developed. However, given the evolution of PV installations, more advanced monitoring techniques are continuously under investigation. In this paper, major photovoltaic system failures are addressed. Then techniques for photovoltaic monitoring proposed in recent literature are overviewed and analyzed to point out their differences, advantages and limits.
Two methods for modeling vibrations of planetary gearboxes including faults: Comparison and validation
 Planetary gearboxes are important components of many industrial applications. Vibration analysis can increase their lifetime and prevent expensive repair and safety concerns. However, an effective analysis is only possible if the vibration features of planetary gearboxes are properly understood. In this paper, models are used to study the frequency content of planetary gearbox vibrations under non-fault and different fault conditions. Two different models are considered: phenomenological model, which is an analytical-mathematical formulation based on observation, and lumped-parameter model, which is based on the solution of the equations of motion of the system. Results of both models are not directly comparable, because the phenomenological model provides the vibration on a fixed radial direction, such as the measurements of the vibration sensor mounted on the outer part of the ring gear. On the other hand, the lumped-parameter model provides the vibrations on the basis of a rotating reference frame fixed to the carrier. To overcome this situation, a function to decompose the lumped-parameter model solutions to a fixed reference frame is presented. Finally, comparisons of results from both model perspectives and experimental measurements are presented.
Simplified evaluation of pipe strains crossing a normal fault through the dissipated energy method
 A dissipated energy method is proposed in this paper to calculate the maximum and minimum pipe strains crossing a normal fault perpendicularly. Two plastic hinges are assumed to form on either side of the fault plane. The curved pipe segment between plastic hinges has different lengths on the footwall and hanging wall sides due to the difference in bearing and uplift soil resistances. A curved pipe length ratio is determined for use in deriving simplified geometric relations. Four energy components are then computed considering rotations at plastic hinges, plastic elongations of the curved pipe segment, and yielding of axial, uplift and bearing soil springs. Minimization of dissipated energy is carried out to find the optimal position of the curved pipe segment for different fault offset. The pipe strains evaluated from the proposed technique are compared with calculations using the existing three-beam analytical method and centrifuge experiments. Upon the successful calibration of the calculation model, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the influence of backfill material, dip angle, burial depth and pipe strength. In the end, an illustrative example is presented to employ the developed analysis framework to run fragility analysis for three pipelines with different diameter to thickness ratios.
A case study of sample entropy analysis to the fault detection of bearing in wind turbine
 Rolling bearing is an important and fragile component in the wind turbine transmission system. The failure of rolling bearing is one of the highest risk events which may result in unexpected economic loss. To give a proper condition assessment of rolling bearing, especially for early fault detection, is of great importance and become an urgent issue to the wind energy industry. In this paper, sample entropy is studied through the field data of wind turbine transmission system measured from Lu Nan Wind Farm in China. Compared with several frequently used statistical indicators, sample entropy features advantages in detecting and evaluating the progress of the early faults of the rolling bearing. The studies show that the sample entropy is an effective and practical tool for condition monitoring of rolling bearing for a wind turbine transmission system.
Exogenous Fault Detection and Recovery for Swarm Robotics
 A robotic swarm needs to maintain continuous operation even in the event of failure of one or more individual robots. Even with a small number of faulty robots, the time for achieving the task will be significantly increased. If the behaviors of biological systems are considered, a number of approaches based on communication, to detect damaged or injured cells or insects can be identified. In this research the transmission of position data between robots has been used as the main method of fault location. The transmission of this data permits members of a robotic swarm to identify and subsequently isolate a faulty robot, either in its drive train or position measurement system. This paper discusses the approach used and presents simulation results.
Identification of the vulnerable transmission segment and cluster of critical machines using line transient potential energy
 When a power system is subjected to a large disturbance, effective identification of vulnerable transmission segment and generator groupings in the electric network contribute to the effective analysis of power system dynamic behaviour and the determination of optimal locations of FACTS devices. Also, computational simple and reliable identification of critical machines is of primary importance in the successful application of direct or hybrid transient stability assessment methods such as TEF, EEAC and hybrid methods. In the paper, a new approach is proposed for identifying the transmission vulnerable segment (the weakest cutset), and then classifying machines into critical cluster and remaining cluster, using a quantitative transmission line vulnerability assessment index derived from the post-fault line transient potential energy and bus voltage changes. The calculation of the index is simple and fast, as only the line flow and bus voltage along the post-fault trajectory are required. Case studies using the IEEE 10-generator and 50-generator test systems are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.
Atomic structures of Ruddlesden-Popper faults in LaCoO3/SrRuO3 multilayer thin films induced by epitaxial strain
 In this paper, scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to study the microstructures of the defects in LaCoO3/SrRuO3 multilayer films grown on the SrTiO3 substrates, and these films have different thickness of SrRuO3 (SRO) layers. Several types of Ruddlesden-Popper (R.P.) faults at an atomic level are found, and these chemical composition fluctuations in the growth process are induced by strain fields originating from the film-film and film-substrate lattice mismatches. Furthermore, we propose four types of structural models based on the atomic arrangements of the R.P. planar faults, which severely affect the functional properties of the films.
Fault location for underground distribution feeders: An extended impedance-based formulation with capacitive current compensation
 Underground distribution systems are normally exposed to permanent faults, due to specific construction characteristics. In these systems, visual inspection cannot be performed. In order to enhance service restoration, accurate fault location techniques must be applied. This paper describes an extended impedance-based fault location algorithm for underground distribution systems. The formulation is developed on phase frame and calculates the apparent impedance using only local voltage and current data. The technique also provides an iterative algorithm to compensate the typical capacitive component current of underground cables. Test results are obtained from numerical simulations using a real underground distribution feeder data from the Electrical Energy Distribution State Company of Rio Grande do Sul (CEEE-D), southern Brazil. Comparative results show the techniques accuracy and robustness in respect to fault type, distance and resistance.
A fuzzy logic based fault classification approach using current samples only
 An approach for classification of transmission line faults is presented. The approach is based on fuzzy logic and requires the consideration of the samples of three phase currents at one end of transmission line. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach extensive simulation studies, using EMTP and MATLAB, have been carried out for different types of fault considering wide variations in the operating conditions.
Adaptive super-twisting observer for fault reconstruction in electro-hydraulic systems
 An adaptive-gain super-twisting sliding mode observer is proposed for fault reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems (EHSS) receiving bounded perturbations with unknown bounds. The objective is to address challenging problems in classic sliding mode observers: chattering effect, conservatism of observer gains, strong condition on the distribution of faults and uncertainties. In this paper, the proposed super-twisting sliding mode observer relaxes the condition on the distribution of uncertainties and faults, and the gain adaptation law leads to eliminate observer gain overestimation and attenuate chattering effects. After using the equivalent output-error-injection feature of sliding mode techniques, a fault reconstruction strategy is proposed. The experimental results are presented, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive super-twisting observer for precise fault reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems.
A new time–frequency approach for distance protection in parallel transmission lines operating with STATCOM
 The paper presents a new cross-differential and impedance protection scheme for a parallel transmission system, in the presence of STATCOM. A cumulative sum (CUSUM) approach is used for fault detection by obtaining the measured values of currents in the two lines. Spectral energies of the current signals are then computed by using a new fast discrete S-Transform (FDST) approach for classification of the nature of faults on the lines. The modified transform is based on new scaling, band pass filtering, and interpolation techniques that makes the new variant computationally much faster than the earlier S-Transform and can be implemented in real time. Further the FDST is used to accurately identify the occurrence of the fault before or after the STATCOM and compute the location of the fault using one half cycle data prior to the occurrence of the fault and one half cycle data after the fault has occurred.
Design, implementation, and evaluation of secure communication for line current differential protection systems over packet switched networks
 In this work we propose a secure communication concept for the protection of critical power supply and distribution infrastructure. Especially, we consider the line current differential protection method for modern smart grid implementations. This protection system operates on critical infrastructure, and it requires a precise time behavior on the communication between devices on both ends of a protected power line. Therefore, the communication has to fulfill deterministic constraints and low-delay requirements and additionally needs to be protected against cyber attacks. Existing systems are often either costly and based on deprecated technology or suffering from maloperations. In order to allow for both, economical and reliable operation, we present the first holistic communication concept capable of using state-of-the-art packet switched networks. Our solution consists of three parts: (i) we develop a list of design requirements for line current differential protection systems communication; (ii) we propose a communication concept obeying these design requirements by combining cryptographical and physical security approaches; and (iii) we evaluate our solution in a practical setup. Our evaluation shows a clock accuracy of 3 µs with a resilience to asymmetric delay attacks down to 8 ns/s. This demonstrates the secure and fault-free operation of a line current differential protection system communicating over a state-of-the-art network.
Smart Power Line and photonic de-icer concepts for transmission-line capacity and reliability improvement
 This paper introduces the Smart Power Line (SPL) concept. This novel approach can be implemented on existing transmission lines comprising of single- or multiple-conductor bundles. It can also be applied to new, advanced line schemes. The SPL addresses three important needs: line de-icing, line impedance modulation and line monitoring. Line de-icing (LDI) can be activated prior to or during any severe climatic event, for concentrating the total power line current into one subconductor at a time and therefore de-icing by the Joule effect. Line impedance modulation (LIM) is another feature of the SPL by which line power flow and stability are also controlled by individually switching in and out subconductors of bundled-conductor lines, thereby modifying the net line impedance directly and dynamically. Line monitoring (LMO) provides real-time data related to electrical, mechanical or climatic events needed for line de-icing, power flow or stability control. By combining these three functions together, the SPL concept is expected to improve transmission-line reliability and transmission-line capacity. The power line reliability and life expectancy are increased by avoiding line and tower collapse due to ice deposits, hard rime or wet snow, reducing metal fatigue and avoiding failure due to galloping. The SPL concept can be applied to bundled-conductor transmission lines at any voltage level (HV and UHV). In addition to the SPL concept, new de-icing equipment, the so-called photonic de-icer, is also introduced in this paper. In order to ensure the mechanical robustness of the transmission line in the event of severe ice storms, past experience has shown that the switchgear must be maintained operational at all times. The photonic de-icer is operated at ground level and at ground potential to melt ice on substation apparatus or to keep the latter warm during icing events.
Extra high speed hybrid protection scheme for high voltage transmission line
 To improve the reliability of traveling wave protection, this paper proposes a hybrid protection scheme based on the traveling wave polarity comparison principle and current differential principle. In this scheme, the traveling wave relay is primary and the current differential relay is supplementary. Two complementary relays simultaneously operate to ensure that the hybrid protection has a good performance. For the general faults, the traveling wave relay can fast discriminate internal faults from external faults using the polarity characteristics of initial current traveling wave. For some special fault conditions, the identification result for fault is determined by the current differential relay. Therefore, the sensitivity and reliability of traditional traveling wave protection may be greatly improved. Using the same hardware platform and only requiring current signal, the hybrid scheme is easily achieved. Simulation results verify that the hybrid protection has fast speed and high reliability level.
Transmission line protection systems with aided communication channels—Part II: Comparative performance analysis
 Following the Part I paper, a comparative performance analysis is presented, considering four different transmission line protection schemes, equipped with aided communication channels. In the Part I paper, the performance analysis methodology was presented, which is based on a probabilistic approach to protection system successful operation. The system performance takes in account equipment reliability factors such as failure rate and time to repair, and is assessed by the availability index. In the present paper, new performance indicators are introduced, which are applicable to transmission line protection system design, as well as to describe its probabilistic operation in other power system studies. Four different transmission line protection schemes with aided communication channels, operating in today's transmission networks, are compared. The results obtained for the performance indicators allow quantifying the benefits of the different design options. In particular, the effect of relay and communication channel redundancy, as well as communication channel sharing, is highlighted. Furthermore, results show that the newly defined performance indicators can be used in a cost/benefit analysis, as well as to assess maintenance strategies and communication reliability requirements.
A functional auxiliary module for 1st-zone conventional distance relays of double-circuit lines to eliminate high fault resistance-introduced under-reach
 This paper presents design steps of an auxiliary module intended to function in conjunction with under-operation 1st-zone conventional distance relays of double-circuit transmission lines. The proposed module pursues the objective of eliminating the underreach of associated ground elements, arising from single-line-to-ground faults of high resistance. It is founded on the online estimation of the fault distance during the faults, through the roots of a non-linear algebraic equation developed in the sequence networks. The equation is mathematically discussed and a fitting numerical algorithm efficiently finding its roots with no concern about the computation burden is chosen. In order to be applicable to the lines of any lengths, particularly long lines, the proposed module is developed through the distributed-parameter based model of double-circuit lines. In addition, it employs only the data acquired at the relaying location and is independent of the network configuration. Important considerations are made for the proposed module, making its function both dependable and secure. Simulation studies conducted in MATLAB and PSCAD/EMTDC examine the proposed module in a variety of influencing situations, and confirm that it accurately fulfills its intended objective within the time frame of the distance protection.
Characterization of faulted dislocation loops and cavities in ion irradiated alloy 800H
 Alloy 800H is a high nickel austenitic stainless steel with good high temperature mechanical properties which is considered for use in current and advanced nuclear reactor designs. The irradiation response of 800H was examined by characterizing samples that had been bulk ion irradiated at the Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory with 5 MeV Fe2+ ions to 1, 10, and 20 dpa at 440 °C. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the size and density of both {111} faulted dislocation loops and cavities as functions of depth from the irradiated surface. The faulted loop density increased with dose from 1 dpa up to 10 dpa where it saturated and remained approximately the same until 20 dpa. The faulted loop average diameter decreased between 1 dpa and 10 dpa and again remained approximately constant from 10 dpa to 20 dpa. Cavities were observed after irradiation doses of 10 and 20 dpa, but not after 1 dpa. The average diameter of cavities increased with dose from 10 to 20 dpa, with a corresponding small decrease in density. Cavity denuded zones were observed near the irradiated surface and near the ion implantation peak. To further understand the microstructural evolution of this alloy, FIB lift-out samples from material irradiated in bulk to 1 and 10 dpa were re-irradiated in-situ in their thin-foil geometry with 1 MeV Kr2+ ions at 440 °C at the Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope. It was observed that the cavities formed during bulk irradiation shrank under thin-foil irradiation in-situ while dislocation loops were observed to grow and incorporate into the dislocation network. The thin-foil geometry used for in-situ irradiation is believed to cause the cavities to shrink.
UKF-based Sensor Fault Diagnosis of PMSM Drives in Electric Vehicles
 The reliability of permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is very important for new energy vehicle, especially for pure electric vehicle which requires a precise operation to achieve high performance. This paper proposes a novel diagnosis scheme that uses three unscented Kalman Filters (UKFs) to detect and isolate current sensor and position sensor faults of PMSM drive system. The PMSM drive model is built in Matlab/Simulink. In the process of fault diagnosis, three UKFs are used in the fault diagnosis process, and each UKF receives different sensor information. All faults can be efficiently isolated by using these UKFs as different faults affect each UKF differently. From the results we got, it is conclude that the proposed methodology could properly handle the nonlinear properties with good robustness and high diagnosis accuracy.
Simulation-driven machine learning: Bearing fault classification
 Increasing the accuracy of mechanical fault detection has the potential to improve system safety and economic performance by minimizing scheduled maintenance and the probability of unexpected system failure. Advances in computational performance have enabled the application of machine learning algorithms across numerous applications including condition monitoring and failure detection. Past applications of machine learning to physical failure have relied explicitly on historical data, which limits the feasibility of this approach to in-service components with extended service histories. Furthermore, recorded failure data is often only valid for the specific circumstances and components for which it was collected. This work directly addresses these challenges for roller bearings with race faults by generating training data using information gained from high resolution simulations of roller bearing dynamics, which is used to train machine learning algorithms that are then validated against four experimental datasets. Several different machine learning methodologies are compared starting from well-established statistical feature-based methods to convolutional neural networks, and a novel application of dynamic time warping (DTW) to bearing fault classification is proposed as a robust, parameter free method for race fault detection.
Transmission Line Power Transfer Capability Improvement, Case Study
 This paper investigates different approaches to improve the power transfer capability (PTC) of transmission lines. Study was performed on the Eastern Gold Fields (EGF) area of the Western Power network in Western Australia where power transfer to this area is currently enhanced using four saturable reactor types static var Compensators (SR SVCs) installed in this region. These SR SVCs have reached to the end of operational life and they are scheduled for replacement by different dynamic reactive power devices such as Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) or Thyristor Controlled SVCs (TSVCs). Another proposed option to enhance the PTC to this area is by upgrading the 220 kV transmission line to 275 kV transmission line and / or using series capacitor compensation. This paper introduces technical and economical study for the aforementioned options and suggests a reliable and cost effective approach to improve the PTC to EGF area.
Ground/sea return with electrode systems for HVDC transmission
 HVDC transmission is booming worldwide. Despite electrode systems are one of the frontiers of DC technology, being a key component of HVDC links, in the experience of the Authors many aspects of their manufacturing, design and operations are less known among the HVDC community with respect to other components, like cables and converters. Aiming at filling this gap, this paper is a survey on ground/sea return with electrode systems for HVDC links, particularly focused on the preliminary design. The configurations of HVDC systems (monopolar, homopolar, bipolar) are recalled first, highlighting the advantages of ground/sea return. Then, ground electrodes are treated, illustrating the basic parameters and geometrical arrangements for the design of ground electrodes. Later, shore and sea electrodes are illustrated. Considerations relevant to ground current close the paper.
Power distribution system fault cause analysis by using association rule mining
 In recent years, with the increasing requirements on power distribution utilities to ensure system reliability and to improve customers and regulators satisfaction, utilities seek to find practical solutions that enable them to restrict specific faults or to better manage their responses to unavoidable power outages. For achieving either, it is crucial to acquire a profound understanding of different faults by exploring their underlying causes and identifying key variables related to those causes. Currently, statistical models as well as advanced data analytics techniques are common tools to gain such understanding. Although basic statistical analysis provides a general knowledge of the primary causes of faults; nevertheless, it falls short of describing nuanced conditions that lead to a fault. On the other hand, applying sophisticated algorithms can produce deeper insight into the main causes; however, it would be computationally burdensome and might require a tremendous amount of running time. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach for fault cause analysis by using association rule mining. The primary goals are to characterize faults according to their underlying causes and to identify important variables that strongly impact fault frequency. This paper proposes a step-by-step procedure, which deals with data preparation, practical issues associated with fault data sets, and implementation of association rule mining. The procedure is followed by a comprehensive case study to demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to mine for causal structures and identify frequent patterns for vegetation, animal, equipment failure, public accident, and lightning-related faults.
Spatial arrangement of faults and opening-mode fractures
 Spatial arrangement is a fundamental characteristic of fracture arrays. The pattern of fault and opening-mode fracture positions in space defines structural heterogeneity and anisotropy in a rock volume, governs how faults and fractures affect fluid flow, and impacts our understanding of the initiation, propagation and interactions during the formation of fracture patterns. This special issue highlights recent progress with respect to characterizing and understanding the spatial arrangements of fault and fracture patterns, providing examples over a wide range of scales and structural settings. Five papers describe new methods and improvements of existing techniques to quantify spatial arrangement. One study unravels the time evolution of opening-mode fracture spatial arrangement, which are data needed to compare natural patterns with progressive fracture growth in kinematic and mechanical models. Three papers investigate the role of evolving diagenesis in localizing fractures by mechanical stratigraphy and nine discuss opening-mode fracture spatial arrangement. Two papers show the relevance of complex cluster patterns to unconventional reservoirs through examples of fractures in tight gas sandstone horizontal wells, and a study of fracture arrangement in shale. Four papers demonstrate the roles of folds in fracture localization and the development spatial patterns. One paper models along-fault friction and fluid pressure and their effects on fault-related fracture arrangement. Contributions address deformation band patterns in carbonate rocks and fault size and arrangement above a detachment fault. Three papers describe fault and fracture arrangements in basement terrains, and three document fracture patterns in shale. This collection of papers points toward improvement in field methods, continuing improvements in computer-based data analysis and creation of synthetic fracture patterns, and opportunities for further understanding fault and fracture attributes in the subsurface through coupled spatial, size, and pattern analysis.
Transmission lines detection technology
 With the development of high-voltage and large-capacity transmission line technology, safe and reliable operation of the transmission line is essential. In view of China’s vast area and varied geographical environment along transmission lines, which are affected by the frequently severe weather and heavy air pollution, etc., it is necessary to detect the device status of the transmission line. Detection equipment and technology should be applied to transmission lines as appropriate to individual lines. State-of-the-art online detection technology and maintenance technology, using infrared and ultraviolet imaging remote sensing, can ensure the safe operation of the line by precisely detecting all kinds of defects of transmission line insulators, conductors, and hardware devices and carrying out line maintenance in good time.
A fault-tolerant ONVIF protocol extension for seamless surveillance video stream recording
 ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) is an importance industrial standard for the video surveillance field. There are over 8000 ONVIF-compliant IP cameras (i.e., ONVIF NVT) and network video recorders (i.e., ONVIF NVS) from various vendors listed on the ONVIF official website. However, because the current ONVIF specifications do not support any fault-tolerant functions to handle NVS failure, in this paper we propose a fault-tolerant solution for ONVIF NVS and try to minimize the modifications to the current ONVIF specifications in the proposed design. Besides, we also propose an extension to the ONVIF NVT for preventing the loss of captured NVT video data during the failover procedure triggered by NVS failure. Finally, we evaluate the following four performance metrics of the proposed fault-tolerant ONVIF surveillance system: the maximal video local cache time supported by an NVT, the response time for accessing an ONVIF web service, the interrupt duration of video recording due to NVS failure, and the live video black out time observed by a video management system. Since the experimental results are all within the acceptable range for a real fault-tolerant video surveillance system in the real world, the experiences provided by this paper is a good reference for improving the fault-tolerant capabilities of the ONVIF video surveillance systems.
A hybrid method for arcing faults detection in large distribution networks
 This paper presents a reliable protection scheme for high impedance fault (HIF) detection in large and complex electrical distribution networks. The proposed algorithm uses dynamic features extracted by stationary wavelet transform and feeds them to a support vector machine-based decision making system. HIF occurrence is detected according to the normalized changes of the features extracted from three post-disturbance data windows. To provide more security, the output of the main fault classifier is compared with the outputs of three other classifiers in a voting system for final decision making. The results of simulations of a real distribution system demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to detect a wide range of arcing faults, from a few amperes to hundreds of amperes, with high level of security against non-HIF phenomena.
On the fault-tolerant performance for a class of robust image steganography
 The mainstream adaptive steganography algorithms often cannot transmit secret messages correctly when stego images suffer from JPEG compression. In this respect, researchers proposed a series of robust adaptive steganography methods based on the framework of “Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes” in previous studies. However, these methods leave behind the fault tolerance analysis, resulting in potential mistakes in extracted messages, which brings uncertainty to practical application. To solve this problem, an error model based on burst errors and STCs decoding damage is given in this manuscript, utilizing the burst error model based on Poisson distribution. Then the model is verified using the hypothesis test problem judged by the χ2 test method. Based on the proposed model, the error conditions of received stego sequence are depicted, and the fault-tolerant performance of the robust steganography based on “Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes” is deduced, that is, the probability lower bound for RS-STCs decoding to correctly extract embedded messages. Experiments demonstrate that the practical fault-tolerant results of previous robust steganography methods consist with the theoretical derivation results, which provides a theory support for coding parameter selection and message extraction integrity to the robust steganography based on “Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes”.
Sparsity guided empirical wavelet transform for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings
 Rolling element bearings are widely used in various industrial machines, such as electric motors, generators, pumps, gearboxes, railway axles, turbines, and helicopter transmissions. Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings is beneficial to preventing any unexpected accident and reducing economic loss. In the past years, many bearing fault detection methods have been developed. Recently, a new adaptive signal processing method called empirical wavelet transform attracts much attention from readers and engineers and its applications to bearing fault diagnosis have been reported. The main problem of empirical wavelet transform is that Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform are strongly dependent on the local maxima of the amplitudes of the Fourier spectrum of a signal, which connotes that Fourier segments are not always reliable and effective if the Fourier spectrum of the signal is complicated and overwhelmed by heavy noises and other strong vibration components. In this paper, sparsity guided empirical wavelet transform is proposed to automatically establish Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. Industrial bearing fault signals caused by single and multiple railway axle bearing defects are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sparsity guided empirical wavelet transform. Results show that the proposed method can automatically discover Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform and reveal single and multiple railway axle bearing defects. Besides, some comparisons with three popular signal processing methods including ensemble empirical mode decomposition, the fast kurtogram and the fast spectral correlation are conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed method.
A study on the on-line measurement of transmission line impedances for improved relaying protection
 This paper proposed an on-line measurement of transmission line impedance in order to improve the accuracy of distance relays and analysis of power system. Distance relays are generally set by the estimated impedance of the protected lines, which involves a certain amount of error in itself. Especially, the zero sequence impedance has more erroneous terms associated with mutual effects in parallel line as well as uncertainty of ground return path. The proposed method is measuring impedance either during normal operation or during faults, and can be applied on-line correction of the setting value of distance relays. This on-line measured positive impedance may be used to monitor the transmission line condition during operation and more accurate impedance data may also improve performance of power system analysis. For verification of the proposed method, several simulations have been executed and shown satisfactory results.
Vibration signal models for fault diagnosis of planet bearings
 Rolling element bearings are key components of planetary gearboxes. Among them, the motion of planet bearings is very complex, encompassing spinning and revolution. Therefore, planet bearing vibrations are highly intricate and their fault characteristics are completely different from those of fixed-axis case, making planet bearing fault diagnosis a difficult topic. In order to address this issue, we derive the explicit equations for calculating the characteristic frequency of outer race, rolling element and inner race fault, considering the complex motion of planet bearings. We also develop the planet bearing vibration signal model for each fault case, considering the modulation effects of load zone passing, time-varying angle between the gear pair mesh and fault induced impact force, as well as the time-varying vibration transfer path. Based on the developed signal models, we derive the explicit equations of Fourier spectrum in each fault case, and summarize the vibration spectral characteristics respectively. The theoretical derivations are illustrated by numerical simulation, and further validated experimentally and all the three fault cases (i.e. outer race, rolling element and inner race localized fault) are diagnosed.
Transmission line vulnerability to lightning over areas of dense rainforests and large rivers in the Amazon region
 The vulnerability under lightning conditions of stretches of the 1500 km long electrical transmission line Tucurui–Oriximina–Manaus over dense Amazon forest canopy and river crossings is evaluated using a leader progression model (LPM) called ModSalto. We find vulnerability windows (low protection or unsafe) in all crossing stretches that use high towers to comply with environmental restrictions. The values of lightning flashover rates (LFR) reach 0.8277 flashover/year or an equivalent period of 14.49 months for stretches of river crossings, and 0.3403 flashover/year or an equivalent period of 35.26 months for stretches of forest canopy crossing. These numbers are above the computed equivalent ANEEL bidding figure of 0.15 flashover/year for that TL. This methodology uses a map of yearly lightning frequency produced with data from STARNET and SIPAM LLS and the level of lightning protection was evaluated with the electro-geometric model (EGM).
Texture-directed twin formation propensity in Al with high stacking fault energy
 Twin boundaries can enhance the strength and preserve the ductility of a variety of metallic materials with face centered cubic structures. However, twin boundaries are rare in aluminum due to its high stacking fault energy. There are limited successes for the formation of nanotwins in Al. Here, we show that twin morphology and twin density in Al can be altered by tailoring the textures of films. Transmission Kikuchi diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies on (111), (110) and (112) textured Al films indicate that Al (112) film has the highest twin density. Two design criteria are identified for the introduction of a high density of growth twins into Al.
An spatiotemporal information system based wide-area protection fault identification scheme
 The paper presents a synchronized phasor measurement based fast and accurate comprehensive wide area back-up protection scheme for transmission lines. The proposed scheme uses Koopman Mode Analysis (KMA) technique on fault current data obtained from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for fault identification in back-up protection. The principal advantage of Koopman operator is that it is based on spatiotemporal information system (STIS). In real world applications, often time and space exists together and hence, dealing with spatial aspect without considering temporal aspect is of limited use. The wide area back-up protection scheme is developed using STIS for fault identification and classification including wide variations in operating conditions of the power network. The New England 39 bus system is used as the test system which is developed on Dig-Silent power factory commercial software (PF4C) platform for evaluating the performance of proposed technique. Further, the efficacy of the proposed scheme is also tested for stressed conditions such as symmetrical fault during power swing and load encroachment and found to work effectively.
Combinatorial Properties of Root-fault Hypertrees
 Combinatorial properties have become more and more important recently in the study of reliability, fault tolerance, randomized routing, and transmission delay in interconnection networks. In this paper, we prove that hypertrees are planar. We also discuss certain combinatorial properties of root-fault hypertrees.
Application of wavelet multiresolution analysis for identification and classification of faults on transmission lines
 This paper presents a new method for identification and classification of faults based on wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA). Daubechies eight (D-8) wavelet transforms of the three phase currents on a transmission line fed from both ends are used. The peak absolute value, the mean of the peak absolute values and summation of the 3rd level output of MRA detail signals of current in each phase extracted from the original signals are used as the criterion for the analysis. The effects of fault distance, fault inception angle and fault impedance are also examined. Extensive simulations are carried out to generate time domain input signal using EMTP (Microtran) on a 230 kV, 200 km long line fed from both ends and simulation results show that the proposed method is a simple, effective and robust method suitable for high impedance faults also.
Torsional vibration signal analysis as a diagnostic tool for planetary gear fault detection
 This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of using the torsional vibration signal as a diagnostic tool for planetary gearbox faults detection. The traditional approach for condition monitoring of the planetary gear uses a stationary transducer mounted on the ring gear casing to measure all the vibration data when the planet gears pass by with the rotation of the carrier arm. However, the time variant vibration transfer paths between the stationary transducer and the rotating planet gear modulate the resultant vibration spectra and make it complex. Torsional vibration signals are theoretically free from this modulation effect and therefore, it is expected to be much easier and more effective to diagnose planetary gear faults using the fault diagnostic information extracted from the torsional vibration. In this paper, a 20 degree of freedom planetary gear lumped-parameter model was developed to obtain the gear dynamic response. In the model, the gear mesh stiffness variations are the main internal vibration generation mechanism and the finite element models were developed for calculation of the sun-planet and ring-planet gear mesh stiffnesses. Gear faults on different components were created in the finite element models to calculate the resultant gear mesh stiffnesses, which were incorporated into the planetary gear model later on to obtain the faulted vibration signal. Some advanced signal processing techniques were utilized to analyses the fault diagnostic results from the torsional vibration. It was found that the planetary gear torsional vibration not only successfully detected the gear fault, but also had the potential to indicate the location of the gear fault. As a result, the planetary gear torsional vibration can be considered an effective alternative approach for planetary gear condition monitoring.
Transmission expansion in Argentina 2: The Fourth Line revisited
 In 1992, Argentina introduced the Public Contest method, which required transmission users to propose, vote and pay for major expansions of the electricity transmission system. Economists, consultants, the regulator and others held the application of this method to be unsuccessful, mainly on the ground that “for many years” it delayed investment in a “much needed” Fourth Line to Buenos Aires. The commentators blamed externalities, free-rider problems, the Area of Influence method used to define voting rights, and transactions costs. This paper re-examines the history and economics of the Fourth Line. The delay to the Fourth Line was short (a year and a half rather than many years) and enabled a significant reduction in construction costs. Externalities, free-riding, the Area of Influence method and transactions costs were not problematic. The Fourth Line was initially rejected because it was unprofitable to key beneficiaries. Far from being much needed, the Fourth Line was not economic because the congestion it avoided was worth less than the cost of building it. It had become more economic to transport gas to generate electricity near Buenos Aires than to transmit electricity over long distances. The location of subsequent power stations reflected this. Even though the presence of a subsidy meant that the Public Contest method did not prevent the building of the Fourth Line, it nonetheless forced a much-needed reappraisal of traditional transmission investment policy.
An enhanced tool for fault analysis in multiphase electrical systems
 This paper describes a new methodology for the fault analysis of an n-conductor electrical system, in which the phase imbalances, neutral cables, groundings, and other inherent characteristics of distribution systems are considered. The proposed methodology, which is based on the current-injection method, allows faults to be represented in a simple way and may be used to analyze several fault types, including internal, series, and simultaneous faults. The results of several cases are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed method.
Fault mirrors along carbonate faults: Formation and destruction during shear experiments
 Glossy, light reflective surfaces are commonly exposed in carbonate fault-zones. It was suggested that such surfaces, recently termed Fault Mirrors (FMs), form during seismic slip. Ultramicroscopic analyses indicate that FMs are highly smooth and composed of a cohesive thin layer of nano-size grains. We explore here mechanisms of formation and destruction of FMs by shear experiments that were conducted on three types of limestone which were sheared at wide range of slip-velocities of v=0.001–0.63m/s, and normal stress up to 1.57 MPa. The experiments showed that FMs started to develop as local patches when the slip velocity exceeded a critical value of 0.07 m/s. The area coverage by FM patches increases systematically with increasing velocity, reaching in a few cases ∼100% coverage. The measured quasi-steady-state friction coefficient, μss, was inversely correlated with the FM coverage: μss∼0.8 for no-FM, at v<0.07m/s, and μss∼0.4 for 50% FM coverage at v∼0.6m/s. Further, in a series of slip-velocity alternation between low and high values, the FMs which formed at a high-velocity stage were destroyed during a subsequent low-velocity stage. Our analyses of the experimental thermal conditions and ultramicroscopy imaging of the FMs suggest that the FMs form by sintering of gouge nanograins during shear. We propose that formation/destruction of FMs in high/low slip-velocity reflects a competition between brittle and ductile processes: FMs form in a ductile mode, and are destroyed by brittle wear. Shear heating during high velocity leads to ductile deformation and sintering so that FM construction rate exceeds brittle FM destruction rate. Based on our results, we suggest that, at least for shallow faults, the presence of extensive FM coverage along natural carbonate faults indicates that the fault segment slipped at seismic velocities and experienced dynamic weakening.
PHASOR MEASUREMENT UNIT BASED WIDE AREA BACKUP PROTECTION SCHEME FOR POWER TRANSMISSION LINES
 Protective relays, pivotal devices that can quickly identify and isolate fault area in power systems, is of great importance for ensuring power system security and reliability. This paper proposes a wide area backup protection scheme for identifying the faulted zone in power transmission lines. This scheme uses the data of wide area measurement systems (WAMS) with constrained number of phasor measurements which are synchronized by nature. First, the number of PMUs required for the scheme is optimized and then, the transmission network is divided into backup protection zones (BPZs) based on the PMU placement and network topology. Whenever the fault arises in a transmission network, the sum of zero and/or positive sequence currents entering the faulted BPZ highly increases, and hence, the faulted BPZ can be determined. This scheme determines the faulted zone quickly and precisely and thereby, reducing the effect of the various faults on the power grid. The proposed method is tested and simulated using a standard WSCC 9-bus system using MATLAB/Simulink.
Fault diagnostics in smart micro-grids: A survey
 Due to rising awareness on environmental protection and for maintenance of clean habitable communities, current and next generation micro-grids are desired to have significant penetration of renewable and clean energy sources. However, a critical issue is the growth of faults in various components of micro-grids, which comprise the underlying energy generation and distribution infrastructure. Moreover, faults can manifest through different failure modes in the same component. If timely diagnostics and maintenance actions are not undertaken, then these faults can cause instabilities, inefficient power generation, and other losses. Therefore, it is important not only to understand the various failure modes, and their root causes and effects, but also to develop real-time automated diagnostics tools that can capture the early signatures of fault evolution for mitigating actions. In this respect, this paper presents a review of different failure modes occurring in various micro-grid components including both clean and conventional energy generation systems. Subsequently, the paper also provides a review on the state-of-the-art of various fault diagnosis approaches available in technical literature. Since multiple approaches can be implemented utilizing the model-based or data-driven methods given the system monitoring and communication infrastructures, the paper has presented the material in a systematic manner for easy understanding. The information presented in this paper will benefit not only the diagnostic engineers but also the control engineers who aim to develop control methodologies for fault-tolerance, mitigation, and equipment life extension based on the tools of early diagnostics.
Distributed Diagnosis of Actuator and Sensor Faults in HVAC Systems*
 This paper presents a model-based methodology for diagnosing actuator and sensor faults affecting the temperature dynamics of a multi-zone heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. By considering the temperature dynamics of the HVAC system as a network of interconnected subsystems, a distributed fault diagnosis architecture is proposed. For every subsystem, we design a monitoring agent that combines local and transmitted information from its neighboring agents in order to provide a decision on the type, number and location of the faults. The diagnosis process of each agent is realized in three steps. Firstly, the agent performs fault detection using a distributed nonlinear estimator. After the detection, the local fault identification is activated to infer the type of the fault using two distributed adaptive estimation schemes and a combinatorial decision logic. In order to distinguish between multiple local faults and propagated sensor faults, a distributed fault isolation is applied using the decisions of the neighboring agents. Simulation results of a 5-zone HVAC system are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
Fault Diagnosis of Pneumatic Systems: Application of a Systematic Model-Based Methodology
 Inclusion of real system data and a systematic model-based approach provides new opportunities in the field of fault diagnosis. The included work was conducted during the first phase of a larger multi-phase project that has the goal of developing methods for detection and diagnosis of faults in large, complex industrial fluid systems. This paper focuses on the application of a systematic model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) methodology to a small-scale pneumatic test bench for proof of concept. FDI schemes were physically implemented on the test bench, leading to successful detection and isolation of injected faults using developed residuals.
Real-time fault tolerant full adder design for critical applications
 In the complex computing system, processing units are dealing with devices of smaller size, which are sensitive to the transient faults. A transient fault occurs in a circuit caused by the electromagnetic noises, cosmic rays, crosstalk and power supply noise. It is very difficult to detect these faults during offline testing. Hence an area efficient fault tolerant full adder for testing and repairing of transient and permanent faults occurred in single and multi-net is proposed. Additionally, the proposed architecture can also detect and repair permanent faults. This design incurs much lower hardware overheads relative to the traditional hardware architecture. In addition to this, proposed design also provides higher error detection and correction efficiency when compared to the existing designs.
Real time evaluation of DWT-based high impedance fault detection in EHV transmission
 It is possible to capture the required travelling wave information contained in fault transients using wavelet transform. This paper presents practical real time testing for the high impedance fault (HIF) detection algorithm based on real time accidents data. The proposed scheme is implemented for HIF detection in extra high voltage transmission lines. The classifier is based on an algorithm that uses recursive method to sum the absolute values of the high frequency signal generated over one cycle and shifting one sample. Characteristics of this scheme are analyzed by extensive real time studies that clearly reveal that this technique can accurately detect HIFs in the EHV transmission lines within only half a cycle from the instant of fault occurrence. The reliability of this scheme is not affected by different fault conditions such as fault distance and fault inception angle.
Shock-induced stacking fault pyramids in Ni/Al multilayers
 The formations of stacking fault tetrahedra in {111}fcc/{111}fcc multilayers have been studied extensively, but the researches related to {001}fcc/{001}fcc interfaces can rarely be found in the literature. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the shock-induced dislocation structure in Ni/Al multilayers was studied in this article, the stacking fault pyramids (SFPs) initiated from Ni/Al interface was firstly observed, and the corresponding mechanism was explored. It was shown that the Shockley partial dislocations dissociated from the rectangular misfit dislocations along Ni/Al interface are first emitted into the Al interlayer and subsequently intersect with each other to form SFPs. With the propagation of the shock front in the multilayers, two adjacent SFPs interact with each other and form Lomer-Cottrell locks. The dislocation sheet composed of SFPs and Lomer-Cottrell locks can act as a barrier to dislocation transmission. The effect of shock piston velocity on the nucleation site of dislocation was also studied. It was shown that dislocations would originate from the interface at a low piston speed (<1.1 km/s), and appear at the shock front if the piston speed exceeds 1.2 km/s.
Vibration characteristic investigation on distribution transformer influenced by DC magnetic bias based on motion transmission model
 Transformer is an important equipment for power energy transmission. The vibration and noise of transformer have always been a serious issue of people concern. Transformer body vibration and noise are mainly caused by the global magnetization of limbs and yokes and magnetic forces of transformer core. However, the process of vibration transfer from core to body is a key factor for monitoring the transformer condition. In this paper, a transformer model for vibration transmission is presented based on motion transmission and it can be used to analyze the vibration relation between core and shell of transformer. Considering strain of silicon steel as the vibration source, the motion equations whichexpress the relations of transformer core and shell are derived. And then, the test system is built to analyze the vibrations of a 5 kVA three phase transformer. A 3D real model simulation used COMSOL finite element software is performed for analyzing the deformation characteristic of transformer. The locations of test points which reflect the vibration more efficiently are determined through the deformation simulation results. Lastly, the vibration signals of two directions have been measured considering DC magnetic bias or not. The experimental results reveal that vibration relations between core and shell are satisfied with the theoretical derivation. Therefore, the Vibration Transmission is significant and it can provide valid method for the DC magnetic bias analysis and core diagnosis of transformer.
High-speed transmission line relaying using artificial neural networks
 A novel feedforward neural network that indicates whether a fault is within or outside the protection zone (fault indicator) of a transmission line is presented. The same technique has been extended to locate the distance of the fault (fault locator). The proposed scheme utilizes the frequency spectrum of the voltages and currents to make a decision. Data obtained from the electromagnetic transient program for single-line-to-ground faults and three-phase faults have been tested and the results are found to be accurate. Using this neural network the relaying decision is obtained within a cycle after the fault inception. The performance of the trained neural network shows promise and has the potential for implementation in a digital relay for transmission line protection.
Bio-inspired fault tolerant network on chip
 The integration of heterogeneous processing elements (PEs) or nodes in the System on Chip (SoC) has made the communication structure very complex. The bus based system between these components is not able to handle the communication requirements and, this has led to the idea of Network on Chip (NoC). The NoC addresses the communication requirement of different nodes on SoC. The physical sizes of devices in NoC are scaled down, including routers, processing elements and interconnects, giving rise to faults, system delay, and latency issues. Fault tolerant routing algorithms are used to recover from temporary faults while redundant resources (wires, routers) are required to overcome the permanent faults. These routing algorithms, however, still suffer from congestion problems, low bandwidth, and throughput utilization as well as lacking adaptivity and robustness. In this work, novel biologically inspired techniques were proposed for NoC using combined best effort (BE) and guaranteed throughput (GT) services. Moreover, the bio-inspired algorithms are compared and analyzed with each other using BE, GT and combined BE-GT services. The bio-inspired mechanisms of “synaptogenesis” and “sprouting” have been adopted in the proposed NoC algorithms and architecture. These techniques were implemented using the BE and GT services. With the help of these two bio-inspired techniques, the NoC becomes robust, fault tolerant and is able to efficiently utilize the throughput and bandwidth. The bio-inspired algorithms improved the accepted traffic (flit/cycle/node) by 38.99% compared to different techniques in the literature. The bio-inspired algorithm also improved the bandwidth and throughput utilization by 71.04% and 72.42% respectively compared to the XY and Odd-Even fault tolerant routing algorithms. Moreover, the bio-inspired algorithm had less end-to-end latency and interflit arrival time by 196.44% and 88.10% respectively compared to the literature techniques of XY and Odd-Even.
Fine grain faults diagnosis of FPGA interconnect
 This paper proposes a new fine grain fault diagnosis method for the interconnect of an arbitrary design implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In the proposed method, interconnect faults detected at the primary output are back-tracked until the faulty nets are precisely located. This is carried out by programming the LUTs on the faulty path to be transparent and thus propagating the value of a specific net under test to the primary output for verification against the expected value of the net. After every back-tracking iteration, the fault location is narrowed down and thus the number of nets to be tested decreases significantly. Therefore, the upper bound of the number of configurations (NMAX) required to locate a faulty net, depends on the maximum combinational depth (DCOMB) of the circuit, and it is approximately equivalent to three times of DCOMB. The proposed method has the ability to locate multiple faults without any fault masking with fault coverage that includes all possible stuck-at, open and pair-wise bridging faults. The proposed method is validated on the ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits mapped on Xilinx Spartan 3E, Virtex-4 and Virtex-5 FPGAs and the results are presented. The simulation results show that applying the proposed method on circuits with less combinational depth reduces the required number of test configurations on average by 35% when compared with the latest method available in the literature.
Discrete wavelet transform optimal parameters estimation for arc fault detection in low-voltage residential power networks
 In this work, an in-depth analysis providing the optimal parameters estimation for discrete wavelet transform (DWT) applied to detection of series arc faults in the household AC power network is presented. The influence of three parameters was investigated: the choice of mother wavelet, level of decomposition and sampling frequency. The line current was used as input for all analyses. A performance criterion based on the energy computation of line currents with and without arc faults was defined and used to compare the influence of 550 combinations of these three parameters on the arc fault detection performances for different loads, including two household appliances. The study showed that the right choice of these three parameters greatly influences the arc fault detection performances. Moreover, for each tested load a frequency range providing maximal arc fault detection performances is identified. The study showed also that the choice of the mother wavelet is less critical than the two other parameters.
A novel fault diagnosis method for lithium-Ion battery packs of electric vehicles
 This paper focuses on fault detection based on interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) method for guaranteeing safe and reliable of electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed method calculates ICC values by capturing the off-trend voltage drop and the voltages are extracted from Service and Management Center of electric vehicles. The ICC value is employed to analyze battery fault by ICC principle. The ICC value not only has advanced fault resolution by amplifying the voltage difference, but also can prolong the fault memory by setting moving windows. Moreover, a loop joints the first and last voltages is designed to locate faults in battery pack. In addition, simulation and experiment are employed to validate and analyze the voltage faults. Based on the simulation verification, the appropriate size of moving windows is set to ensuring sensitivity of fault detection method. The experiment results indicate the method can appropriately detect fault signals for EVs.
Formation and growth of stacking fault tetrahedra in Ni via vacancy aggregation mechanism
 Using molecular dynamics simulations, the formation and growth of stacking fault tetrahedra (SFT) are captured by vacancy cluster diffusion and aggregation mechanisms in Ni. The vacancy-tetrahedron acts as a nucleation point for SFT formation. Simulations show that perfect SFT can grow to the next size perfect SFT via a vacancy aggregation mechanism. The stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM) calculations and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations reveal that SFT can form farther away from the initial cascade-event locations, indicating the operation of diffusion-based vacancy-aggregation mechanism.
Improvement of Protection Coordination for a Distribution System Connected to a Microgrid using Unidirectional Fault Current Limiter
 The presence of distributed generation (DG) units in distribution systems increases the fault current level, which disrupts the existing coordination time interval of the protective overcurrent relays. One of the ways for decreasing DG effects on the coordination of protective devices is re-coordination of the relays by installing unidirectional fault current limiter (UFCL) between the main grid (upstream network) and the microgrid (downstream network). The UFCL does not limit fault current contribution of the upstream network when fault occurs in downstream but limits fault current contribution of the downstream network when fault occurs in the upstream. Moreover, it preserves the coordination between all of the relays. Several case studies are carried out for illustrating the performance of the UFCL in maintaining the relay coordination.
Three-dimensional analysis of a faulted CO2 reservoir using an Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka approach to rock elastic properties and fault permeability
 This work develops a three-dimensional (3D) multiscale model to analyze a complex carbon dioxide (CO2) faulted reservoir that includes some key geologic features of the San Andreas and nearby faults southwest of the Kimberlina site. The model uses the STOMP-CO2 code for flow modeling that is coupled to the ABAQUS® finite element package for geomechanical analysis. A 3D ABAQUS® finite element model is developed that contains a large number of 3D solid elements with two nearly parallel faults whose damage zones and cores are discretized using the same continuum elements. Five zones with different mineral compositions are considered: shale, sandstone, fault damaged sandstone, fault damaged shale, and fault core. Rocks' elastic properties that govern their poroelastic behavior are modeled by an Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka approach (EMTA), which can account for up to 15 mineral phases. The permeability of fault damage zones affected by crack density and orientations is also predicted by an EMTA formulation. A STOMP-CO2 grid that exactly maps the ABAQUS® finite element model is built for coupled hydro-mechanical analyses. Simulations of the reservoir assuming three different crack pattern situations (including crack volume fraction and orientation) for the fault damage zones are performed to predict the potential leakage of CO2 due to cracks that enhance the permeability of the fault damage zones. The results illustrate the important effect of the crack orientation on fault permeability that can lead to substantial leakage along the fault attained by the expansion of the CO2 plume. Potential hydraulic fracture and tendency for the faults to slip are also examined and discussed in terms of stress distributions and geomechanical properties.
A novel algorithm for fault classification in transmission lines using a combined adaptive network and fuzzy inference system
 Accurate detection and classification of faults on transmission lines is vitally important. In this respect, many different types of faults occur, inter alia low impedance faults (LIF) and high impedance faults (HIF). The latter in particular pose difficulties for the commonly employed conventional overcurrent and distance relays, and if not detected, can cause damage to expensive equipment, threaten life and cause fire hazards. Although HIFs are far less common than LIFs, it is imperative that any protection device should be able to satisfactorily deal with both HIFs and LIFs. Because of the randomness and asymmetric characteristics of HIFs, the modelling of HIF is difficult and many papers relating to various HIF models have been published. In this paper, the model of HIFs in transmission lines is accomplished using the characteristics of a ZnO arrester, which is then implemented within the overall transmission system model based on the electromagnetic transients programme. This paper proposes an algorithm for fault detection and classification for both LIFs and HIFs using Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The inputs into ANFIS are current signals only based on Root-Mean-Square values of three-phase currents and zero sequence current. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a typical 154 kV Korean transmission line system under various fault conditions. Test results show that the ANFIS can detect and classify faults including (LIFs and HIFs) accurately within half a cycle.
A novel index for the robustness comparison of classifiers in fault diagnosis
 The design of robust data-based fault diagnostic systems can be formulated in terms of classification tasks. A diagnostic classifier designed to effectively minimize the false and missing alarm rates resulting from noise, uncertainty, and unknown disturbances while maintaining a relatively high performance can be defined as robust. This paper presents a novel criterion to compare off-line the robustness of classifiers. The proposed index allows to complement the estimated misclassification rate and to quantify the quality of any data-based diagnostic system more rigorously. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed index, both Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines are used as diagnostic classifiers for the Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor benchmark.
Study of optimal combination between SFCL location and PSS type to improve power system transient stability
 In this paper, authors present a method to select the optimal combination between the type of the power system stabilizer (PSS) and the location of a Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) in an Electrical Power Grid (EPG) to improve the transient stability in case of fault. The angular separation between generators rotors when different types of short-circuit appears in the EPG is used as the main criterion of the proposed method to select this optimal combination. To complete the study, the optimal resistive value of the SFCL is evaluated to improve the global stability of the EPG. Results show that an optimal combination between the type of PSS, the location of SFCL in the EPG and the resistive value of SFCL exists in order to obtain the smallest variation of the angular separation of generators rotors, i.e. the best stability of the power system in case of fault.
Fault Diagnosis Based Approach to Protecting DC Microgrid Using Machine Learning Technique
 The electronic equipment used in DC microgrids is in essential need of more secure protection against short circuit faults. Due to the high current at the time of fault occurrence, the whole system might be de-energized which would have a severely negative impact on the entire system. An effective method to detect, isolate, and protect the DC microgrid system against the effects of short circuit faults is extremely important. This research proposes a highly effective new method to protect the DC microgrid system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will detect and isolate the fault before it affects other parts of the system. It would, therefore, be more dependable for DC microgrid protection. This protection network is distributed all along the DC microgrid system protecting the entire microgrid network and is connected to the other protective devices in the system.
Volcanic avalanche fault zone with pseudotachylite and gouge in French Massif Central
 Structures and textures with sedimentological variations at different scales of the lithofacies assemblage help us to constrain the basal kinematic transition from non-depositional to depositional conditions during volcanic avalanche emplacement. In the well-exposed impact-sheared contact along volcanic avalanche fault zone in the French Massif Central, we observe how the granular textures of the pseudotachylite and fault gouge have recorded the propagation of shock wave with granular oscillatory stress. Sequential events of basal aggradation along avalanche fault zone have been established related to fractal D-values, temperature pressure regime and oscillatory stress during slow wave velocity. A typical lithofacies assemblage with a reverse grading shows the pseudotachylite and fault gouge. A cataclastic gradient is characterised by the fractal D-values from 2.7 in jigsaw breccias with pseudotachylite partial melt, to 2.6 in the polymodal gouge. Shock, brecciation and comminution produce cataclastic shear bands in the pseudotachylite and quartz microstructures along the basal contact of the volcanic debris-avalanche deposit. Gouge microstructures show granular segregation, cataclasis with antithetic rotational Riedel shear, and an arching effect between the Riedel shear bands. X-ray microtomography provided 3D microfabrics along the clastic vein in the sandy-gouge. From the available statistical dataset, a few equations have been developed implicating the same cataclastic origin with a co-genetic evolution of lithofacies. An impact wave during primary shear propagation may contribute to produce hydroclastic matrix, pseudotachylite partial melt and proximal gouge thixotropy with v ~ 50m/s and a T < 654 °C. The interseismic period with oscillatory stress is related to crushed clasts and basaltic melt around ~ 800 °C, Riedel shear bands with granular segregation along the fault gouge. The secondary shock by matrix-rich avalanche (ΔP = 10GPa, T ≥ 1000–1500 °C) contributes to quartz microstructures along the avalanche basal contact and quartz spheroids in microscopic cataclastic shear bands. Decompression around 654–800 °C is related to tertiary sub-vertical oscillations with a backward moving shock and antithetic rotational fault megablock. Semi-quantitative analyses of seismogenic fault basement contribute to establish the localised conditions related to sequential aggradation along volcanic avalanche fault zone.
Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motor bearings using undersampled vibration signals from a wireless sensor network
 Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which consist of miscellaneous sensors are used frequently in monitoring vital equipment. Benefiting from the development of data mining technologies, the massive data generated by sensors facilitate condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, too much data increase storage space, energy consumption, and computing resource, which can be considered fatal weaknesses for a WSN with limited resources. This study investigates a new method for motor bearings condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using the undersampled vibration signals acquired from a WSN. The proposed method, which is a fusion of the kurtogram, analog domain bandpass filtering, bandpass sampling, and demodulated resonance technique, can reduce the sampled data length while retaining the monitoring and diagnosis performance. A WSN prototype was designed, and simulations and experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results indicated that the sampled data length and transmission time of the proposed method result in a decrease of over 80% in comparison with that of the traditional method. Therefore, the proposed method indicates potential applications on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motor bearings installed in remote areas, such as wind farms and offshore platforms.
Integrating angle-frequency domain synchronous averaging technique with feature extraction for gear fault diagnosis
 Gear fault diagnosis relies heavily on the scrutiny of vibration responses measured. In reality, gear vibration signals are noisy and dominated by meshing frequencies as well as their harmonics, which oftentimes overlay the fault related components. Moreover, many gear transmission systems, e.g., those in wind turbines, constantly operate under non-stationary conditions. To reduce the influences of non-synchronous components and noise, a fault signature enhancement method that is built upon angle-frequency domain synchronous averaging is developed in this paper. Instead of being averaged in the time domain, the signals are processed in the angle-frequency domain to solve the issue of phase shifts between signal segments due to uncertainties caused by clearances, input disturbances, and sampling errors, etc. The enhanced results are then analyzed through feature extraction algorithms to identify the most distinct features for fault classification and identification. Specifically, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) targeting at nonlinearity, Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) targeting at high dimensionality, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) targeting at local similarity among the enhanced data are employed and compared to yield insights. Numerical and experimental investigations are performed, and the results reveal the effectiveness of angle-frequency domain synchronous averaging in enabling feature extraction and classification.
Fault classification and location using HS-transform and radial basis function neural network
 A new approach for protection of transmission lines has been presented in this paper. The proposed technique consists of preprocessing the fault current and voltage signal sample using hyperbolic S-transform (HS-transform) to yield the change in energy and standard deviation at the appropriate window variation. After extracting these two features, a decision of fault or no-fault on any phase or multiple phases of the transmission line is detected, classified, and its distance to the relaying point found out using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) with recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. The ground detection is done by a proposed indicator ‘index’. As HS-transform is very less sensitive to noise compared to wavelet transform, the proposed method provides very accurate and robust relaying scheme for distance protection.
Sinusoidal synthesis based adaptive tracking for rotating machinery fault detection
 This paper presents a novel Sinusoidal Synthesis Based Adaptive Tracking (SSBAT) technique for vibration-based rotating machinery fault detection. The proposed SSBAT algorithm is an adaptive time series technique that makes use of both frequency and time domain information of vibration signals. Such information is incorporated in a time varying dynamic model. Signal tracking is then realized by applying adaptive sinusoidal synthesis to the vibration signal. A modified Least-Squares (LS) method is adopted to estimate the model parameters. In addition to tracking, the proposed vibration synthesis model is mainly used as a linear time-varying predictor. The health condition of the rotating machine is monitored by checking the residual between the predicted and measured signal. The SSBAT method takes advantage of the sinusoidal nature of vibration signals and transfers the nonlinear problem into a linear adaptive problem in the time domain based on a state-space realization. It has low computation burden and does not need a priori knowledge of the machine under the no-fault condition which makes the algorithm ideal for on-line fault detection. The method is validated using both numerical simulation and practical application data. Meanwhile, the fault detection results are compared with the commonly adopted autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (ARMED) method to verify the feasibility and performance of the SSBAT method.
Faulting processes in active faults – Evidences from TCDP and SAFOD drill core samples
 The microstructures, mineralogy and chemistry of representative samples collected from the cores of the San Andreas Fault drill hole (SAFOD) and the Taiwan Chelungpu-Fault Drilling project (TCDP) have been studied using optical microscopy, TEM, SEM, XRD and XRF analyses. SAFOD samples provide a transect across undeformed host rock, the fault damage zone and currently active deforming zones of the San Andreas Fault. TCDP samples are retrieved from the principal slip zone (PSZ) and from the surrounding damage zone of the Chelungpu Fault. Substantial differences exist in the clay mineralogy of SAFOD and TCDP fault gouge samples. Amorphous material has been observed in SAFOD as well as TCDP samples. In line with previous publications, we propose that melt, observed in TCDP black gouge samples, was produced by seismic slip (melt origin) whereas amorphous material in SAFOD samples was formed by comminution of grains (crush origin) rather than by melting. Dauphiné twins in quartz grains of SAFOD and TCDP samples may indicate high seismic stress. The differences in the crystallographic preferred orientation of calcite between SAFOD and TCDP samples are significant. Microstructures resulting from dissolution–precipitation processes were observed in both faults but are more frequently found in SAFOD samples than in TCDP fault rocks. As already described for many other fault zones clay-gouge fabrics are quite weak in SAFOD and TCDP samples. Clay-clast aggregates (CCAs), proposed to indicate frictional heating and thermal pressurization, occur in material taken from the PSZ of the Chelungpu Fault, as well as within and outside of the SAFOD deforming zones, indicating that these microstructures were formed over a wide range of slip rates.
Travelling wave pilot protection for LCC-HVDC transmission lines based on electronic transformers’ differential output characteristic
 Considering travelling wave’s bandwidth which varies from several kilohertz to hundreds of kilohertz, traditional current and voltage transformers cannot transfer whole bandwidth of travelling wave. However, electronic transformers, including Rogowski coil based electronic current transformer and capacitance divided electronic voltage transformer, have much wider bandwidth (up to 500 kHz) which could transfer almost whole bandwidth of travelling wave without distortion. Besides, secondary side’s output of electronic transformer is the differential signal of primary side. So, the integration circuit can be omitted when using differential travelling wave signal directly in protection principle. Traditional travelling protection for high voltage direct current (HVDC) lines is highly affected by grounding resistance. And the backup protection, such as current differential protection, has long operation time. So the paper proposes a novel travelling wave pilot protection based on the differential output signal of electronic transformers. Differential voltage and current travelling wave have axisymmetric relationship when the fault occurs at forward direction. Conversely, differential voltage and current travelling wave almost overlap when the fault occurs at reverse direction. Considering fault direction identification results of two ends, fault section can be determined. Besides, according to amplitude ratio of fault line and normal line, fault line can be selected correctly. The simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC prove the correctness, sensitivity and reliability.
Fault mode analysis and detection for gear tooth crack during its propagating process based on dynamic simulation method
 Gearbox is one of the most important parts of rotating machinery, therefore, it is vital to carry out health monitoring for gearboxes. However, it is still an unsolved problem to disclose the impact of gear tooth crack fault on gear system vibration features during the crack propagating process, besides effective crack fault mode detection methods are lacked. In this study, an analytical model is proposed to calculate the time varying mesh stiffness of the meshing gear pair, and in this model the tooth bending stiffness, shear stiffness, axial compressive stiffness, Hertzian contact stiffness and fillet-foundation stiffness are taken into consideration. Afterwards, the vibration mechanism and effects of different levels of gear tooth crack on the gear system dynamics are investigated based on a 6 DOF dynamic model. Then, the crack fault vibration mode is studied, and a parametrical-Laplace wavelet method is presented to describe the crack fault mode. Furthermore, based on the maximum correlation coefficient (MCC) criterion, the optimized Laplace wavelet base is determined, which is then designed as a health indicator to detect the crack fault. The results show that the proposed method is effective in fault diagnosis of severe tooth crack as well as the early stage tooth crack.
ANN applications in fault locators
 Recent developments indicate that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) may be appropriate for assisting dispatchers in operating electric power systems. The fault location algorithm being a key element in the digital relay for power transmission line protection, this paper discusses the potential applicability of ANN techniques for determination of fault location and fault resistance on EHV transmission lines with remote end in-feed. Most of the applications make use of the conventional Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model based on back propagation algorithm. However, this model suffers from the problem of slow learning rate. A modified ANN learning technique for fault location and fault resistance determination is presented in this paper. A reasonably small NN is built automatically without guessing the size, depth, and connectivity pattern of the NN in advance. Results of study on a 400 kV transmission line are presented for illustration purposes. Performance of the modified ANN is compared with the analytical algorithms and conventional MLP algorithm for different combinations of pre-fault loading condition, fault resistance and fault location. The results are found to be encouraging.
Wind adaptive modeling of transmission lines using minimum description length
 The transmission lines are moving objects, which positions are dynamically affected by wind-induced conductor motion while they are acquired by airborne laser scanners. This wind effect results in a noisy distribution of laser points, which often hinders accurate representation of transmission lines and thus, leads to various types of modeling errors. This paper presents a new method for complete 3D transmission line model reconstruction in the framework of inner and across span analysis. The highlighted fact is that the proposed method is capable of indirectly estimating noise scales, which corrupts the quality of laser observations affected by different wind speeds through a linear regression analysis. In the inner span analysis, individual transmission line models of each span are evaluated based on the Minimum Description Length theory and erroneous transmission line segments are subsequently replaced by precise transmission line models with wind-adaptive noise scale estimated. In the subsequent step of across span analysis, detecting the precise start and end positions of the transmission line models, known as the Point of Attachment, is the key issue for correcting partial modeling errors, as well as refining transmission line models. Finally, the geometric and topological completion of transmission line models are achieved over the entire network. A performance evaluation was conducted over 138.5 km long corridor data. In a modest wind condition, the results demonstrates that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of non-wind-adaptive initial models on an average of 48% success rate to produce complete transmission line models in the range between 85% and 99.5% with the positional accuracy of 9.55 cm transmission line models and 28 cm Point of Attachment in the root-mean-square error.
Numerical modeling of normal fault-pipeline interaction and comparison with centrifuge tests
 Pipelines extend thousands of kilometers across wide geographic areas to provide products for modern life. It is inevitable therefore that pipelines must pass through active faulting zones. The safety of pipe networks should be maintained by employing an appropriate design method. Beam-on-spring analysis is the normal design approach, but it is difficult to choose the spring stiffness for pipelines crossing a dip-slip (normal/reverse) fault, since the native soils beneath the pipe trench may provide extra restraints on relative pipe-soil movement. Alternatively, three-dimensional finite element analysis has the potential to provide useful design calculations which account for (a) axial and flexural stiffness of the pipe, (b) geometry and kinematics of the problem (including the actual trench size and correct ground motion), (c) stiffness of the pipe relative to the soil stiffness assembled from the different components of the surrounding soil (the undisturbed native soil material, the bedding soil, the sidefill and the backfill), and (d) nonlinear effects like formation of gaps and shear failure of the soil. Using geotechnical centrifuge test measurements, three-dimensional finite element models are developed to capture the behaviours observed for buried pipelines of various materials subjected to differential ground movements associated with normal faulting. Material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity, and the contact, detachment and slippage behaviour on the soil-pipe interface are explicitly modeled. Using hexahedron continuum elements, satisfactory reproductions of the centrifuge experiments are achieved for flexural responses of the test pipes. The finite element analysis is then used to investigate the impact of trench burial conditions.
Distribution systems fault analysis considering fault resistance estimation
 Fault resistance is a critical component of electric power systems operation due to its stochastic nature. If not considered, this parameter may interfere in fault analysis studies. This paper presents an iterative fault analysis algorithm for unbalanced three-phase distribution systems that considers a fault resistance estimate. The proposed algorithm is composed by two sub-routines, namely the fault resistance and the bus impedance. The fault resistance sub-routine, based on local fault records, estimates the fault resistance. The bus impedance sub-routine, based on the previously estimated fault resistance, estimates the system voltages and currents. Numeric simulations on the IEEE 37-bus distribution system demonstrate the algorithm’s robustness and potential for offline applications, providing additional fault information to Distribution Operation Centers and enhancing the system restoration process.
Primary frequency control and dynamic grid support for vehicle-to-grid in transmission systems
 Because of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) growth, the provision of ancillary services by V2Gs is now required in the most recent network codes. A lack of primary frequency control (PFC) and dynamic grid support (DGS) in V2Gs could thus be detrimental to power system stability. This research presents a detailed V2G model with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The main contribution of the model is the simultaneous provision of PFC and DGS at its plug-in terminal. PFC includes both droop response (DR) and inertial response (IR). Accordingly, a frequency management system (FMS) determines the command of the V2G converter control for PFC without disturbing the scheduled charging-discharging. Simultaneously, this control enables DGS. The design of a new model for connecting V2Gs at transmission level allows the assessment of power system stability. This research study analysed the stability of an IEEE 39 bus system with 30% V2G penetration after critical contingencies. Various strategies for providing ancillary services in V2Gs (DGS and/or PFC) were compared in two scenarios defined by extreme V2G operating modes (as load or generator) at different locations. An analysis of the impact of each ancillary service as well as their interaction was performed to measure their influence on both system stability and critical operating variables of V2Gs. The results showed that system stability remained almost invariable when the V2Gs included PFC (DR+IR) and DGS.
Location correction technique based on mobile communication base station for earthquake population heat map
 China has mobile phone penetration rate of over 96.2%. Mobile phone has become the largest Internet terminal for Chinese Internet users. Population geographic distribution in earthquake zones can be got based on mobile phone positioning and map matching. For reducing earthquake black-box stage, we propose a real-time collection, correction and schedule algorithm of population position data by four stream processing environments (Redis, Hbase, Kafka, and Spark Streaming) in this paper. For labeling precisely population geographic distribution on the network map, matching of population geographic coordinates and map coordinates are optimized by sample comparison based on location data of mobile communication base stations and prefecture level cities. The test result shows the proposed system is high efficient and can rapidly respond to any emerging parallel tasks during the earthquake. A high-precision heat map of affected population can be produced and published on-line within 2 min after the devastating earthquake happened.
An improved bistable stochastic resonance and its application on weak fault characteristic identification of centrifugal compressor blades
 Large-scale centrifugal compressors play an important role in modern industry. As the core component of a centrifugal compressor, the blades are prone to fatigue failure due to the long-term operation in complex conditions. If the early stage blade failure cannot be found in time, catastrophes could be caused by this potential risk. However, since the blades work in a closed environment, there is always lack of effective monitoring techniques. Aiming at this challenge, pressure pulsation signal inside the compressor is studied in this paper for the condition monitoring and weak fault waring of blades indirectly. A big issue is that the fault characteristic induced by incipient blade crack is quite weak, which will be much weaker in pressure pulsation signal, and interfered with strong noise. Hence, appropriate feature extraction methods are urgently needed. An adaptive bistable stochastic resonance method combined with multi-scale noise tuning is proposed to improve this problem. As the classical stochastic resonance is just suitable for small parameter signal, normalized scale transformation is adopted to overcome this disadvantage. In addition, numerical stability analysis for the stochastic resonance system is conducted to ensure the convergence of system output and improve the characteristic enhancement performance of proposed method. Simulation signal is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method first. Then, the experimental pressure pulsation signal is analyzed by this method. Analysis results verify that the proposed diagnostic framework can effectively identify the weak characteristic frequency induced by blade crack and has potential for long-term condition monitoring and fault warning of large-scale centrifugal compressor blades.
An efficient diagnostic technique for distribution systems based on under fault voltages and currents
 Service continuity is one of the major aspects in the definition of the quality of the electrical energy, for this reason the research in the field of faults diagnostic for distribution systems is spreading ever more. Moreover the increasing interest around modern distribution systems automation for management purposes gives faults diagnostics more tools to detect outages precisely and in short times. In this paper, the applicability of an efficient fault location and characterization methodology within a centralized monitoring system is discussed. The methodology, appropriate for any kind of fault, is based on the use of the analytical model of the network lines and uses the fundamental components rms values taken from the transient measures of line currents and voltages at the MV/LV substations. The fault location and identification algorithm, proposed by the authors and suitably restated, has been implemented on a microprocessor-based device that can be installed at each MV/LV substation. The speed and precision of the algorithm have been tested against the errors deriving from the fundamental extraction within the prescribed fault clearing times and against the inherent precision of the electronic device used for computation. The tests have been carried out using Matlab Simulink for simulating the faulted system.
A Smartwatch-Based Framework for Real-Time and Online Assessment and Mobility Monitoring
 Smartphone and smartwatch technology is changing the transmission and monitoring landscape for patients and research participants to communicate their healthcare information in real time. Flexible, bidirectional and real-time control of communication allows development of a rich set of healthcare applications that can provide interactivity with the participant and adapt dynamically to their changing environment. Additionally, smartwatches have a variety of sensors suitable for collecting physical activity and location data. The combination of all these features makes it possible to transmit the collected data to a remote server, and thus, to monitor physical activity and potentially social activity in real time. As smartwatches exhibit high user acceptability and increasing popularity, they are ideal devices for monitoring activities for extended periods of time to investigate the physical activity patterns in free-living condition and their relationship with the seemingly random occurring illnesses, which have remained a challenge in the current literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a smartwatch-based framework for real-time and online assessment and mobility monitoring (ROAMM). The proposed ROAMM framework will include a smartwatch application and server. The smartwatch application will be used to collect and preprocess data. The server will be used to store and retrieve data, remote monitor, and for other administrative purposes. With the integration of sensor-based and user-reported data collection, the ROAMM framework allows for data visualization and summary statistics in real-time.
A laboratory experiment to monitor the contact state of a fault by transmission waves
 We performed a series of laboratory experiments in which elastic waves were transmitted across a simulated fault. Two types of experiments were carried out: (1) Normal Stress Holding Test (NSHT): normal stress was kept constant for about 3 h without shear stress and transmission waves were observed. (2) Shear Stress Increasing Test (SSIT): shear stress was gradually increased until a stick-slip event occurred. Transmission waves were continuously observed throughout the process of stress accumulation. We focused on the change in transmission waves during the application of shear stress and especially during precursory slips. It was found in NSHT that the amplitude of transmission waves linearly increased with the logarithm of stationary contact time. The increase amounted to a few percent after about 3 h. Creep at asperity contacts is responsible for this phenomenon. From a theoretical consideration, it was concluded that the real contact area increased with the logarithm of stationary contact time. We observed in SSIT a significant increase in wave amplitude with shear stress application. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to the time effect observed in NSHT. Instead, it can be explained by the mechanism of “junction growth” proposed by Tabor. Junction growth yields an increase in real contact area. It is required for junction growth to occur that the material in contact is already plastic under a purely normal loading condition. A computer simulation confirmed that this requirement was satisfied in our experiments. We also found that the rate at which the amplitude increased was slightly reduced prior to a stick-slip event. The onset time of the reduction well coincides with the onset of precursory slip. The cause of the reduction is attributed to the reset of stationary contact time due to displacement. This interpretation is supported by the result of NSHT. Taking the time of stationary contact in SSIT into account, we may expect the change in wave amplitude to be, at most, only a few percent. The observed slight reduction in increasing rate is, in this sense, reasonable. The static stiffness of the fault also decreases with precursory slip. It was also found that low frequency waves are a better indicator of precursory slip than high frequency waves. This might suggest that low frequency waves with longer wavelength are a better indicator of average behavior of faults. The problem, however, merits a further investigation. The shifts in phase were also found to be a good indicator of the change in contact state of the fault. The changes in both amplitude and phase of transmission waves are unifyingly understood through the theory of transmission coefficient presented by Pyrak-Nolte et al. Rough surfaces have a tendency to give larger stick-slips than smooth surfaces. The amount of precursory slip is larger for rough surfaces than for smooth surfaces. Although it was confirmed by a computer simulation that rough surfaces have larger contact diameters than smooth surfaces, the rigorous relationship between the surface roughness (contact diameter) and the amount of precursory slips was not established.
Gas supply reliability assessment of natural gas transmission pipeline systems
 The uncertainty of market demand and dynamic behaviour of the pipeline system are usually ignored in previous gas supply reliability assessments. With the intent of overcoming these deficiencies, a novel methodology to assess the gas supply reliability of natural gas transmission pipeline systems is proposed in this paper. Considering both gas supply capacity and market demand uncertainties, calculations of these two items are integrated into a single Monte Carlo simulation. On each Monte Carlo trial, the hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow is combined with the state transition process simulation to calculate the gas supply capacity. In terms of market demand, the load duration curve technology is employed to predict the amount of demand. Then, the indicator proposed to quantify gas supply reliability is calculated on each trial. Finally, the average gas supply reliability is obtained based on N Monte Carlo trials. Applications of this methodology are demonstrated through a real transmission pipeline system. Thereafter, the method is compared with previous approaches and differences are discussed. Furthermore, the impacts of supply capacity and market demand uncertainties on the gas supply reliability are investigated and suggestions to improve the gas supply reliability are proposed.
Framework for fault diagnosis with multi-source sensor nodes in nuclear power plants based on a Bayesian network
 Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) provides safety alarms and diagnostic functions for a nuclear power plant (NPP), which comprises large and complex systems. Here, a technical framework based on a Bayesian network (BN) for FDD is introduced because of its advantages of easy visualization, expression of parameter uncertainties, and ability to perform diagnosis with incomplete data. However, a BN raises a new problem when it is applied to NPPs; i.e., how to cope with parameter or node information from multiple sensors. Sensor data must be consolidated because creating a single node for each sensor in the network would lead to information overload. This paper proposes a possible solution to this issue and then constructs an FDD system framework with a BN as the backbone. Within this framework, principal component analysis is used to remove information from malfunctioning sensors, and fuzzy theory and data fusion are combined to further improve data accuracy and combine data from multiple sensors into one node. On this basis, a BN inference junction tree algorithm is used in FDD because it can deal with incomplete data. A BN model for a pressurized water reactor is created to validate the method framework. Simulation experiments indicate the suitability of the proposed method for online FDD in NPPs using multi-sensor information. It is thus concluded that the proposed method is a feasible scheme for the FDD of NPPs.
Measurement of Instantaneous Angular Displacement Fluctuation and its applications on gearbox fault detection
 Recently, Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) measurement is successfully established and prevalently applied to a wide variety of machines due to the hypothesis that the speed fluctuation of rotating machinery carries plentiful dynamic responses. Nevertheless, exploration and application based on angular signal are still insufficient. Under the same hypothesis, in this paper, we introduced an extended algorithm named Instantaneous Angular Phase Demodulation (IAPD), together with the selection of optimal sideband family to extract the Instantaneous Angular Displacement Fluctuation (IADF) signal. In order to evaluate the performance of IADF signal, an effective approach was demonstrated using IADF signal to address the fault detection and diagnosis issue. After extracting the IADF signal, a much effective method was developed to deal with the large amount of data generated during the signal collection process. Then, we used the well-developed techniques, i.e., empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and envelope analysis, to undertake the signal de-noising and feature extraction task. The effectiveness and capability of the IADF signal were evaluated by two kinds of gearboxes under differentconditions in practice. In particular, the prevalent IAS signal and vibration signal were also involved and testified by the proposed procedure. Experimental results demonstrated that by means of the IADF signal, the combination of EMD and envelope analysis not only provided accurate identification results with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, but was also capable of revealing the fault characteristics significantly and effectively. In contrast, although the IAS signal had the potential ability to diagnose the serious fault, it failed for the slight crack case. Moreover, the same procedure even its improvements, i.e., ensemble empirical mode decomposition and local mean decomposition, all failed to recognize the faults in terms of vibration signals.
Model-based Fault-Tolerant Control of Uncertain Particulate Processes: Integrating Fault Detection, Estimation and Accommodation
 This work presents a methodology for the integrated identification, estimation and accommodation of control actuator faults in particulate processes with discretely-sampled measurements and plant-model mismatch. Initially, a stabilizing state feedback controller is designed on the basis of a reduced-order model of the infinite-dimensional system, and the closed-loop stability region is characterized in terms of the model uncertainty, the fault magnitude, the sampling period and the control design parameters. When state measurements are unavailable, the reduced-order inter-sample model predictor generates state estimates which are updated at each sampling time. A moving-horizon optimization problem is then formulated and solved for on-line actuator fault detection, isolation and estimation using past state and input data. The resulting estimates are used to locate the operating point with respect to the closed-loop stability region, which in turn is used to carry out the fault accommodation logic via updating the pot-fault control model and/or adjusting the controller design parameters. The developed methodology is illustrated using a non-isothermal continuous crystallizer example.
On the nucleation of planar faults during low temperature and high stress creep of single crystal Ni-base superalloys
 The present work studies the nucleation of planar faults in the early stages of low temperature (750 °C) and high stress (800 MPa) creep of a Ni-base single crystal superalloy (SX). Two families of 60° dislocations with different Burgers vectors were detected in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). These can react and form a planar fault in the γ′ phase. A 2D discrete dislocation model helps to rationalize a sequence of events which lead to the nucleation of a planar fault. First, one 60° channel dislocation approaches another 60° interface dislocation with a different Burgers vector. At a distance of 5 nm, it splits up into two Shockley partials. The interface dislocation is pushed into the γ′-phase where it creates a small antiphase boundary. It can only move on when the leading Shockley partial joins it and creates an overall 1/3<112> superdislocation. This process is fast and therefore is difficult to observe. The results obtained in the present work contribute to a better understanding of the processes which govern the early stages of low temperature and high stress primary creep of SX.
Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis Using Long-short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Network
 With the fast development of science and industrial technologies, the fault diagnosis and identification has become a crucial technique for most industrial applications. To ensure the system safety and reliability, many conventional model based fault diagnosis methods have been proposed. However, with the increase in the complexity and uncertainty of engineering system, it is not feasible to establish accurate mathematical models most of the time. Rotating machinery, due to the complexity in its mechanical structure and transmission mechanics, is within this category. Thus, data-driven method is required for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis scheme based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed. With the available data measurement signals from multiple sensors in the system, both spatial and temporal dependencies can be utilized to detect the fault and classify the corresponding fault types. A hardware experimental study on wind turbine drivetrain diagnostics simulator (WTDDS) is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
A cluster-based dissimilarity learning approach for localized fault classification in Smart Grids
 Modeling and recognizing faults and outages in a real-world power grid is a challenging task, in line with the modern concept of Smart Grids. The availability of Smart Sensors and data networks allows to “x-ray scan” the power grid states. The present paper deals with a recognition system of fault states described by heterogeneous information in the real-world power grid managed by the ACEA company in Italy. The pattern recognition problem is tackled as two-class classification problem using a Clustering-Evolutionary Computing approach and it is able to generate together with a Boolean decision also a score value. The last is computed through a fuzzy membership function and output values are interpreted as a reliability measure for the Boolean decision rule. As many real-world pattern recognition applications, the starting feature space is structured and the custom based dissimilarity measure adopted leads to a non-Euclidean dissimilarity matrix. Hence, a comparison of the classification performances between the proposed two-class classifier system and the well-known Support Vector Machine, on the data set at hands, is performed using a suitable kernel designed for the non-Euclidean case.
Reliability assessment of generation and transmission systems using fault-tree analysis
 This paper presents a method that integrates deterministic approach with fault-tree analysis for reliability assessment of a composite system (generation and transmission in power systems). The contingency screening is conducted in the first step. The results are further classified into three clusters in the second step: normal, local trouble and system trouble. The fault-tree analysis is used to assess the reliability of the composite system in the third step. Finally, Risk Reduction Worth is adopted as a measure of importance for identifying the crucial element that has significant impact on the reliability. In this paper, a composite system in Taiwan serves as an example for illustrating the simulation results attained by the proposed method. The simulation results, verified by Siemens PTI PSS/E TPLAN software package, show that the proposed method is applicable for large scale power systems.
A novel traveling-wave-based directional protection scheme for MTDC grid with inductive DC terminal
 This paper presents a new rapid and reliable directional protection scheme for Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) grid with an inductive DC terminal. The proposed method determines an internal or external fault easily by comparing the transient energy polarities of traveling waves measured at both ends of each line section. Compared with the conventional direction principle based on traveling waves, the proposed method performs more reliably in the case of an inductive terminal. Moreover, the double-end fault location method based on traveling waves is integrated into the protection scheme to predict the accurate fault location. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a meshed DC grid modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software. Extensive simulation results show the proposed method is able to determine internal or external faults correctly under conditions of different fault types, fault distances and fault resistances. Furthermore, the proposed method is also insensitive to the sampling frequency and noises.

Automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection: A review of current status and the potential role of deep learning
 To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.
Characterisation of power system events on South African transmission power lines
 Records of faults occurring on the South African power transmission system over a 16-year period have been collected. Over 12,000 faults were analysed to find statistical relationships between local climate, key design parameters of the overhead lines, and the main causes of power system faults identified as bird streamers, lightning, fire and pollution. The results characterise the performance of the South African transmission system on a probabilistic basis and illustrate differences in fault cause statistics for the summer and winter rainfall areas of South Africa and for different times of the year and day. The analysis illustrates the effectiveness of bird guards on towers.
Analysis of the faults involving adjacent conductors of a six-phase transmission line together with a modelling of the phase conversion transformer
 In a bulk power transmission system the amount of power transfer can be increased by converting the widely used three-phase double-circuit lines into six-phase single-circuit lines instead of upgrading the transmission voltage. In this conversion process only a phase conversion transformer at each end of the line is required while the existing conductors, towers and corridors of three-phase lines can be used intact. However, this conversion will have an effect on the system fault currents and fault levels. The well-known symmetrical component method is suitable for fault analysis in a three-phase system, but it has been found unsuitable for analysing the practical faults on a six-phase line and for modelling the phase conversion transformer. This paper illustrates the way the phase conversion transformer has been incorporated in the six-phase line fault modelling and also presents a new application of the straightforward loop current method by using it to determine the currents and fault MVA corresponding to the common and practical faults on a 132 kV six-phase line. The same method has also been applied to the fault analysis of a 132 kV and a 230 kV three-phase line and the results are compared with those for the six-phase line.
Online estimation of the electrochemical impedance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells using broad-band current excitation
 In this work, an online algorithm to estimate the electrochemical impedance spectrum of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is presented. The electrochemical impedance, constituting the linear dynamic relation between current and voltage, is described by a discrete time filter model. The unknown model parameters are estimated from streaming time domain data using a recursive algorithm based on the generalized total least squares (GTLS) technique. This allows for flexible noise assumptions, leading to unbiased parameter estimates in the presence of noisy current and voltage measurements. Therefore, the robustness of the proposed method is significantly increased. Broad-band current excitation signals are utilized as to sufficiently stimulate the fuel cell for the online parameter estimation. The model order is selected using Akaike's information criterion (AIC), leading to a parsimonious model. Equivalent circuits are automatically generated using Foster's method of analog circuit synthesis. The applicability and benefits of the proposed algorithm regarding fuel cell diagnostics are demonstrated using measurement data of a small scale single cell (5 cm2 active area) subjected to a broad-band excitation.

This technique is applied to an existing 13.8-kv distribution network, which caters to an oil production field spread over an area of ≈60 km2. The nature of this distribution system, which consists of multi-ring configuration, illustrates the complexity of the network. Simulation results for a case study have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the suggested fault location method.
Condition based maintenance of bearings and gears for fault detection – A review
 Machines without vibrations in the working environment are something non-existent, which create vibrations and henceforth result in deterioration of machine apparatuses in the long run bringing on failure of a few subsystems or the machine itself. Vibration analysis is the most predominant procedure to recognize the nature and degree of any issues in machines and components (i.e. bearings and gears) or any upkeep choices identified with the machine. The condition-based maintenance is the request based upkeep to guarantee the machine accessibility by convenient maintenance activities and lessening breakdown upkeep. This paper introduces the state-of-the-art-review to give a wide and great reference for analysts to be used on condition based maintenance of bearings and gears for fault detection.
Fault detection method for grid-connected photovoltaic plants
 In this work, an automatic fault detection method for grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) plants is presented. The proposed method generates a diagnostic signal which indicates possible faults occurring in the GCPV plant. In order to determine the location of the fault, the ratio between DC and AC power is monitored. The software tool developed identifies different types of faults like: fault in a photovoltaic module, fault in a photovoltaic string, fault in an inverter, and a general fault that may include partial shading, PV ageing, or MPPT error. In addition to the diagnostic signal, other essential information about the system can be displayed each 10 min on the designed tool. The method has been validated using an experimental database of climatic and electrical parameters regarding a 20 kWp GCPV plant installed on the rooftop of the municipality of Trieste, Italy. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method can detect and locate correctly different type of faults in both DC and AC sides of the GCPV plant. The developed software can help users to check possible faults on their systems in real time.
Adaptive setting of distance relay for MOV-protected series compensated line considering wind power
 Series compensated lines are protected from overvoltage by metal-oxide-varistors (MOVs) connected in parallel with the capacitor bank. The nonlinear characteristics of MOV devices add complexity to fault analysis and distance protection operation. During faults, the impedance of the line is modified by an equivalent impedance of the parallel MOV/capacitor circuit, which affects the distance protection. The intermittent wind generation introduces additional complexity to the system performance and distance protection. Wind variation affects the fault current level and equivalent MOV/capacitor impedance during a fault, and hence the distance relay operation. This paper proposes an adaptive setting method for the mho relay distance protection of series compensated line considering effects of wind power variation and MOV operation. The distributed parameters of a transmission line are taken into account to avoid overreaching and underreaching of distance relays. A test system is simulated, and results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to resetting the distance relays to adapt to various system conditions, including three wind generation and different compensation levels.
Analysis of simultaneous unbalanced short circuit and open conductor faults in power systems with untransposed lines and six-phase sections
 The paper introduces a generalized method for analysis of multiple, simultaneous short circuit, open circuit, and open circuit falling conductor faults in mixed three-phase and six-phase power systems with untransposed lines. The method is systematic and suitable for all types of faults, any number of simultaneous faults, and any number of phases. Calculation of all network unbalanced voltages and currents during faults is done in one straightforward step. Coupling among sequence networks in untransposed transmission lines is accounted for. Coupling between the three-sequence networks of the three-phase part and the six-sequence networks of six-phase part is also derived. The method is applied also for transient stability study of mixed three-phase and six-phase power systems during any type of faults. Detailed derivation of the governing equations in each part is presented. Simulation results on the IEEE 300-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system are given to validate the proposed method.

Simulation results show that the proposed method can be highly reliable in detecting high impedance fault for harmless and secured operations.
A novel approach to adaptive single phase auto-reclosing scheme for EHV transmission lines
 In modern interconnected power systems, nearly 80% of faults in high voltage transmission lines are intrinsically transient. The necessity of rapid fault clearing has resulted in fast development of protection equipments. Moreover, need for reliable supply of loads has led to improvements in single phase auto-reclosing equipments. In this paper, a novel and efficient method is proposed that leading to improved performance and efficiency of single phase auto-reclosing. In the case of occurrence of permanent faults, the proposed yardstick is accurate and authentic to diagnose fault type (transient or permanent). To validate accuracy and authenticity of the proposed method, a 400 kV transmission system is simulated using EMTP software and results are presented.
A novel adaptive stochastic resonance method based on coupled bistable systems and its application in rolling bearing fault diagnosis
 Stochastic resonance (SR), as a typical noise-assisted signal processing method, has been extensively studied in weak signal detection by virtue of the advantage of using noise to enhance the feature of periodic signal. And how to better apply the SR method in engineering signal processing has always been the research hotspot. In this paper, a novel adaptive SR method based on coupled bistable systems (ACBSR) is proposed to further improve the performance of SR method for weak signal detection. Compared with the cascaded bistable SR system, the suggested coupled bistable SR (CBSR) system can enhance the target signal while suppressing the low-frequency and high-frequency interferences, whose output behavior exhibits good bandpass filtering characteristic. In addition, a weighted spectral peak signal-to-noise ratio (WPSNR) index is constructed by using spectral peak SNR, spectral correlation coefficient and zero-crossing ratio to serve as the measurement index of SR for periodic signal detection. The constructed WPSNR index is simple in form and easy to calculate, which can quantitatively evaluate the resonance effect of periodic signal, even though the target signal frequency cannot be estimated accurately. And the combination of WPSNR index and the CBSR system is beneficial to improve the performance of SR method in rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Experiments and engineering application are performed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ACBSR method in comparison with the traditional SR method.
Sensitivity of hydraulic properties to dynamic strain within a fault damage zone
 Seismically induced water level changes were observed in seven wells in the south part of the Tanlu fault zone, eastern China. Three wells are located within damage zone of the Tanlu major fault zone, and four wells are relatively far from the fault. The three wells located within the fault damage zone showed strong sustained water level changes in response to the passage of seismic waves, while the four wells outside the fault zone showed oscillational behaviors during the passage of seismic waves. We utilized tidal factor and phase shift as a proxy for hydraulic property and found that, at the three wells within the fault damage zone, hydraulic properties (permeability and poroelastic properties) changed after multiple large earthquakes, in contrast, at the four wells outside the fault damage zone, hydraulic properties remained unchanged before and after each earthquake. Contrasting the hydraulic response behaviors and properties within and outside the fault damage zone, we suggest that hydraulic properties within a fault damage zone are more sensitive and vulnerable than that away from the fault damage zone. The sensitivity and vulnerability may be correlated to seismically induced dynamic strains loading on damaged rocks, which can effectively change permeability and poroelastic properties of a groundwater system.
Distance relaying for transmission line using support vector machine and radial basis function neural network
 The proposed technique consists of preprocessing the fault current signal samples using discrete wavelet transform to yield the change in energy (ce) and standard deviation (sd) at the appropriate level of decomposition of fault current and voltage signal for faulty phase identification and fault location determination. After feature extraction (ce and sd) from fault current signal, support vector machine (SVM) is used for decision of fault or no-fault on any phase or multiple phases of the transmission line. The ground detection is done by a proposed indicator ‘index’ with a threshold value. Once the faulty phases are identified, the fault location from the relaying point can be accurately estimated using RBFNN (radial basis function neural network) with recursive least square algorithm. For fault location both current and voltage signals are preprocessed through wavelet transform to yield change in energy (ce) and standard deviation (sd) which are used to train and test the RBFNN to provide fault location from the relaying point accurately. The combined SVM and RBFNN based technique is tested for faults with wide range of operating conditions and provides accurate results for fault classification and location determination, respectively.
Dynamic performance of the power differential relay for transmission line protection
 Power differential relay was proposed recently as a practical relaying scheme for transmission systems. In this paper, the dynamic behaviour of the power differential relay is thoroughly investigated. These investigations are important to evaluate the overall performance of such relaying functions. For this target, a detailed simulation of a typical transmission system was developed via the MATLAB/SIMULINK package using detailed modeling for each power system element. Both stable and unstable power swings are considered. Moreover, single machine-infinite bus and double machine system operations are considered for all possible faulty and non-faulty conditions. All applied test results confirm the superiority of the power differential relay as an ideal candidate for transmission system protection applications.
Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis
 The paper deals with detection of fault conditions based on measurements of vibration made on rotary machines in various industries. Detection of sources of vibration will be made based on the amplitude spectra and phase relationships of vibrations of individual machine parts, using the envelope of technology in detecting recurring events with low levels of the measured signal and processing of high-frequency signal in the range of acoustic emission. Because the display of a set of symptoms to the space of fault conditions for these methods is not simple, it is advisable to use a multi-parameter approach which means that important decisions are made on the basis of different types of measurements, for example, with using techniques of modal analysis and operational modal analysis. The paper presented the results of various measurements on the machinery.
Application study of superconducting fault current limiters in meshed HVDC grids protected by fast protection relays
 The complexity of DC side short circuit fault current interruption has been identified as a major drawback of realization of multi-terminal HVDC grids. Although application of superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) in protection of HVDC systems based on slow protective schemes has been studied in the literature, its application in meshed HVDC systems based on modern and fast protective schemes has not been investigated, yet. This paper scrutinizes the SFCL application in the meshed HVDC grids protected by the fast DC protective schemes and fast hybrid DC circuit breakers. The purpose of SFCL application is to reduce the current interruption requirement of the HVDC circuit breaker and size of its elements. This research analyzes the requirements of suitable SFCL considering the fault operation behaviors of local protective relays and the hybrid DC circuit breakers. The results show that the appropriated SFCL can reduce fault current peak, size of current limiting inductor and also fault identification time. The application of SFCL not only reduces the size of surge arrester in the hybrid DC circuit breaker, but also can significantly decrease the current stress on the hybrid DC circuit breaker.
TECHNO-ECONOMIC analysis of high potential offshore wind farm locations in Turkey
 The wind energy market is rapidly growing in Turkey which made it one of the top three countries in Europe, and the seventh in the world, in terms of wind power capacity addition in 2016. Turkey has high onshore and offshore wind power potential which is widely distributed across the country. However, there has been no offshore wind farm (OWF) in operation in Turkey. This paper performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of OWF projects in three of the most promising wind locations (namely, Bozcaada, Gokceada, and Bandirma). The optimal OWF sites are selected by applying a multi-criteria site selection method to Turkey's coastal regions. Technical analysis consists of annual energy production estimation using the Virtual Wind Farm model and development of various electrical system design topologies for the proposed OWF projects. A detailed economic feasibility analysis is then conducted using a discounted cash flow economic model that considers current Turkish renewable energy support schemes under various discount rates. Taking the OWF investor's perspective, this study accounts for the key economic indicators which are used in the decision-making processes. The results of various model runs are compared to determine the best options for the proposed OWF investments to be profitable. It is shown that the proposed OWF projects are economically feasible only in the case of meeting certain techno-economic conditions. The radial electrical design is proved to be the most cost-effective option. Among the proposed projects, the Bozcaada OWF appears to be the best investment option with a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $81.85–109.55 per MWh while the Bandirma OWF is the least economically viable with an LCOE of $100.73–135.97 per MWh. The findings are extrapolated to suggest feasible recommendations for the investors and policy makers which will help to shape the offshore wind energy outlook of Turkey.

Comparative study of superconducting fault current limiter both for LCC-HVDC and VSC-HVDC systems
 High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) system has been evaluated as the optimum solution for the renewable energy transmission and long-distance power grid connections. In spite of the various advantages of HVDC system, it still has been regarded as an unreliable system compared to AC system due to its vulnerable characteristics on the power system fault. Furthermore, unlike AC system, optimum protection and switching device has not been fully developed yet. Therefore, in order to enhance the reliability of the HVDC systems mitigation of power system fault and reliable fault current limiting and switching devices should be developed. In this paper, in order to mitigate HVDC fault, both for Line Commutated Converter HVDC (LCC-HVDC) and Voltage Source Converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system, an application of resistive superconducting fault current limiter which has been known as optimum solution to cope with the power system fault was considered. Firstly, simulation models for two types of LCC-HVDC and VSC-HVDC system which has point to point connection model were developed. From the designed model, fault current characteristics of faulty condition were analyzed. Second, application of SFCL on each types of HVDC system and comparative study of modified fault current characteristics were analyzed. Consequently, it was deduced that an application of AC-SFCL on LCC-HVDC system with point to point connection was desirable solution to mitigate the fault current stresses and to prevent commutation failure in HVDC electric power system interconnected with AC grid.
Power system fault diagnosis based on history driven differential evolution and stochastic time domain simulation
 Fault diagnosis is an important task in power system analysis. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed to perform online fault diagnosis of transmission lines. Stochastic time domain simulation (STDS) is firstly introduced to generate simulated fault and system data so as to improve the computational speed of fault diagnosis and handle the possible malfunction of protective relays and circuit breakers. The fault diagnosis problem is then formulated as an optimization problem, which can take into account the possible malfunction of protection devices and post-fault system trajectories. We propose a novel optimization algorithm, namely history driven differential evolution (HDDE) to solve the formulated optimization problem. The proposed methodology is finally tested using comprehensive case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.
Locating faults in the transmission network using sparse field measurements, simulation data and genetic algorithm
 The paper presents a modeling and simulation approach to locate a fault in a transmission network. The basic concept is to match phasors recorded during fault with the corresponding phasors obtained by simulating the same fault. For the simulation, it is necessary to assume a fault location in a power system model, and then carry out short circuit study. The matching degree can be calculated by a pre-set criterion. The operation is repeated till the best match is found. The process of finding the best match is an optimization problem, therefore, the genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to find the optimal solution. The proposed approach is suitable for situations where only sparsely recorded field data is available. Under such circumstances, the proposed approach can offer more accurate results than other known techniques.
Transmission scanning electron microscopy: Defect observations and image simulations
 The new capabilities of a FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) detector for defect characterization have been studied in parallel with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Stacking faults and dislocations have been characterized in strontium titanate, a polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy and a single crystal cobalt-base material. Imaging modes that are similar to conventional TEM (CTEM) bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) and STEM are explored, and some of the differences due to the different accelerating voltages highlighted. Defect images have been simulated for the transmission scanning electron microscopy (TSEM) configuration using a scattering matrix formulation, and diffraction contrast in the SEM is discussed in comparison to TEM. Interference effects associated with conventional TEM, such as thickness fringes and bending contours are significantly reduced in TSEM by using a convergent probe, similar to a STEM imaging modality, enabling individual defects to be imaged clearly even in high dislocation density regions. Beyond this, TSEM provides significant advantages for high throughput and dynamic in-situ characterization.
An Accurate Method for Fault Location on Electric Power Transmission Lines
 This paper proposes a new method for fault location on electric power transmission lines. The problem is here approached by identifying from pre-fault records an equivalent circuit for the far end of a transmission line. Based on the assumption that this equivalent is valid for the first few post fault cycles the position of the fault is calculated by solving the system of nonlinear equations, which can be formulated for each type of fault, using recorded fault waveforms. These equations are solved by applying Newton-Raphson technique. The method is finally examined by analysing two computer simulated faults on a 130 kV transmission line.
Broadcasting with linearly bounded transmission faults
 We consider broadcasting with a linearly bounded number of transmission failures. For a constant parameter 0 < α < 1 we assume that at most αi faulty transmissions can occur during the first i time units of the communication process, for every natural number i. Every informed node can transmit information to at most one neighbor in a unit of time. Faulty transmissions have no effect. We investigate worst-case optimal non-adaptive broadcasting time under this fault model, for several communication networks. We show, e.g., that for the n-node line network this time is linear in n, if 1/2, and exponential otherwise. For the hypercube and the complete graph, broadcasting in the linearly bounded fault model can be performed in time logarithmic in the number of nodes.
Vibration transmission and energy dissipation through the gear-shaft-bearing-housing system subjected to impulse force on gear
 In this work, an eight-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of the gear-shaft-bearing-housing system is established and the vertical vibration transmission and energy dissipation characteristics through the multiple transmitting interfaces under the impulse force due to gear fault are studied. The elastic deformations at the interfaces between gear and shaft, inner race and outer race, outer race and housing are formulated by the corresponding contact stiffness. The housing compliance is also included. A half-sine impulse force with two characteristic parameters as amplitude and time duration, which are associated with the defect type and size, is employed to represent the effect of gear fault on the system dynamics. The acceleration responses for different transmitting components as gear, inner race, outer race and housing are calculated for different impulse time duration, different impulse force amplitudes and shaft rotating speeds. The vibration transmission and energy dissipation through the multiple interfaces are characterized by the defined vibration transmission ratio and energy dissipation ratio. Obvious attenuation in acceleration magnitude is observed between the transmitting components from gear to housing. The maximum attenuation occurs at the transmission from inner race to outer race, while the minimum is between the outer race and the housing. The time duration of the impulse force determines the resonance and also the vibration transmission characteristics of the system. The energy dissipation increases nonlinearly with the amplitude of the applied impulse force. Results also suggest that the interface between inner race and outer race, and the interface between gear and shaft dissipated about 60% and 40% of the total energy, are the main sources of energy dissipation in the system. However, the shaft rotating speed has limited effect on the vertical impulse vibration amplitude, vibration transmission and energy dissipation. Experimental validation is performed, which supports the characteristics obtained from numerical results.
Fault Detection-Location in Robots Using a Scheme of Observers
 To implement fault tolerance techniques on robot architecture, a scheme of fault detection-location has been developped. This scheme corresponds to a combination of asymptotic, unknown inputs and dedicated observers which allow fault detection-location in robot structure by monitoring of corresponding residuals.
A cost-effective fault management system for distribution systems with distributed generators
 Fault Management System (FMS) is one of the main functions in Distribution Automation System (DAS); however, the conventional FMS cannot be used in distribution systems with Distributed Generators (DGs) due to the lack of directional function. The directional fault detection device is expensive due to the expensive directional module used. In a wide-ranging distribution system, the investment cost will be very high if the fault detecting devices are expensive. Therefore, the design and implementation of a cost-effective FMS for distribution system with DGs is necessary. A Multi-Level Fault-Current Indicator (MLFCI) having a plurality of reed switches used to detect different current levels is proposed in this paper. The hardware prototype is designed and implemented. An algorithm used to locate fault based on the different fault current levels is derived. A MLFCI-based FMS for distribution systems with DGs is then realized. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed MLFCI. Simulation results are then used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed MLFCI-based FMS for distribution systems with DGs.
An adaptive algorithm to prevent distance relay overreach during CCVT transient
 In this paper, the impact of coupling capacitor voltage transformer (CCVT) subsidence transients on the performance of distance relay is investigated. The reach accuracy of distance relay is not maintained during CCVT subsidence transient and for this the responsible factors are system source-impedance-ratio (SIR), CCVT secondary burden, and fault inception angle. Relay generally overreaches during CCVT subsidence transient and in order to mitigate this problem an integrated adaptive logic is proposed. The adaptive zone-1 algorithm uses two criteria: (1) online SIR calculation using prefault and fault positive sequence voltage and current measured at relay location and (2) the maximum value of the transient monitor function obtained from the three-phase voltages to discriminate the in-zone fault from out-of-section fault. For accurate zone discrimination and to avoid relay overreach issue during end zone fault, the importance of adaptive threshold is crucial and can be set based on the online computed SIR value. The simulation study is performed using EMTDC/PSCAD. As the CCVT available in master library (ML) is not able to develop sufficient subsidence transient, a 500 kV, 60 Hz CCVT is modelled. Distance relay performance is analysed for different critical cases using the developed CCVT model and also the response of proposed method is observed. Results for different critical cases prove that the proposed method is able to maintain proper selectivity between in-zone and end-zone faults and also using the method the time-delay operation can be avoided during subsidence transient in the secondary side of CCVT
The broadband frequency characteristics of major equipment in the ±800 kV converter station and their influences to the short-circuit fault transient
 Due to the wide application of high-order resonant and nonlinear electric equipment in the UHVDC converter station, the electromagnetic transient process is a complex issue during the short-circuit fault transient of the system caused by lightning strike or other reasons. In this study, firstly, an operating ±800 kV DC line is artificially short-circuited to simulate the flashover fault process. The instantaneous voltages and currents and the electrical fields are measured by advanced sensors and high sampling rate recording devices at different points in the converter station, in order to comprehensively study the high-frequency characteristics of the UHVDC system. Then, the portal impedances of the major UHVDC equipment as well as the stray parameters are systematically measured in an actual ±800 kV station. Based on the data measured, the accurate high-frequency characteristics of the ±800 kV converter station are analyzed. The results of the study can be used to guide the EMC and relay protection designs of the UHVDC converter station, so that the stability of the system can be improved.
Phase selection and fault section identification in thyristor controlled series compensated line using discrete wavelet transform
 Discrete wavelet transform is used to analyze faulty signals for a transmission system employing a thyristor controlled series capacitor at the midpoint of a line. Different frequency components of current signals are considered to select the phase(s) involved with a fault. To identify the fault section the new approach utilizes the difference in high frequency components of the current signals. For both phase selection and section identification tasks new energy and standard deviation-based indices are also calculated for the transmission system.
Analysis and control of bridge-type fault current limiter integrated with the dynamic voltage restorer
 This paper proposes a novel bridge-type solid-state fault current limiter based on dynamic voltage restorer (BFCL-DVR). The new topology uses a DC-link in the back-to-back converter of DVR. The proposed BFCL-DVR is equivalent to the conventional DVR during normal operation mode. At fault inception, the controller deactivates the series converter IGBTs in faulty phase and activates the DC-link semiconductor switches, thus establishing an equivalent bridge-type current limiter to restrict the fault current. The magnitude of the fault current is adjustable by controlling the frequency and duty ratio of the semiconductor switch that is in parallel with the discharging resistance. Moreover, the device is able to quickly recover from the current limiting mode to the normal operation mode. In this study, the operation sequence, optimal value of discharging resistance, duty cycle, and frequency of semiconductor switches are obtained. The design methodology of the proposed BFCL-DVR is fully verified using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Experimental results validate the proposed topology and theoretical analysis.
A hybrid fault locator for three-terminal lines based on wavelet transforms
 This paper presents a hybrid fault location algorithm for three-terminal transmission lines based on wavelet transforms (WT). In this work, the WT were used to analyze the low and high frequency components of the current and/or voltage signals generated by an electric fault. A simple routine was used to determine which method should be used for each case. The methodology is called “hybrid” as it uses either traveling waves or impedance calculation methods to locate the fault. The traveling wave method analyses the current and/or voltage high frequency signals extracted by WT to determine the fault location. On the other hand, the fundamental frequency components of the voltage and current signals, also extracted by WT, can be used for the same purpose. The hybrid algorithm was tested for different fault conditions by simulations using alternative transients program (ATP) software. The results obtained are promising and demonstrate a highly satisfactory degree of accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.
Load-conscious maximization of base-station location privacy in wireless sensor networks
 In various applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), sensor nodes forward data packets towards an in-situ base-station (BS) over multi-hop routes. The BS not only collects and analyzes the incoming data, but also interfaces the WSN to a higher authority. The unique role of the BS attracts adversary's attention since it can be a single point of failure for the WSN. An adversary that seeks to diminish the network utility can apply traffic analysis techniques in order to uncover the sink of all traffic (i.e., the BS) and target it with denial of service attacks. In this paper, we present a technique for preserving location privacy of the BS. Our technique injects deceptive transmissions aiming to even the traffic density across the network and make the BS undistinguishable. We highlight the trade-off between location privacy and network's performance/lifetime, and show how our technique strikes a balance between conflicting metrics. The simulation results confirm that our proposed traffic analysis countermeasure effectively boosts the location privacy of the BS without a significant impact on the network's performance and lifetime.
Optimal transmission conversion from alternating current to high voltage direct current transmission systems for limiting short circuit currents
 The excess of short circuit currents (SCC) has threatened the security of electrical energy transmission and become one of the most critical problems in power grid operations. At present, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology is a practical and applicable option to limit short circuit currents by separating a synchronous power grid into several asynchronous power grids. During the transmission expansion planning, the short circuit currents can be effectively limited by strategically converting alternating current to high voltage direct current transmission systems, improving transmission capacity as well. Due to the high construction cost of high voltage direct current transmission systems, improper conversion would influence the economy of power system planning and the effect of short circuit currents reduction. Therefore, an approach of optimal transmission conversion (OTC) for limiting short circuit currents is proposed in this paper. To solve the problem with the strong nonlinearity of short circuit currents, a novel linearization method based on direct current power flow is developed. The case study based on a 22-bus power system and IEEE 118-bus system are performed for illustration and validation. The simulation results demonstrate that the short circuit currents are effectively reduced and the security of electrical energy transmission is guaranteed by applying the proposed approach and model. The major contribution of this paper is to provide a new method for limiting short circuit currents. Hopefully, the proposed approach can provide new insights for the planning and operations of large-scale hybrid power systems.
Mobile local search with noisy locations
 The deep penetration of mobile devices have led to the emergence of multiple mobile applications that seek to harness the positioning capabilities embedded in such devices. One of the most functional of these applications is local search. Local search is similar to a regular web search, yet is more powerful in a mobile setting since results are ranked both by prominence and locality. Undoubtedly popular, the current design of local search applications fails to cater equally to a privacy-aware user who desires finer controls in her location disclosure. Towards this end, we propose the design for a private local search (PriLS) application that enables a user to first learn the geographic variation in local search results and then use it to determine a noisy location that has little or no affect on the search results. Parametric studies and real-world evaluations show that PriLS can help identify geographic locations that would produce similar search results (compared to when the user’s location is used) with no noticeable delays in user experience. They also reveal that large areas typically exist where there is no change in the result of a local search query, and can be exploited to provide spatial privacy guarantees to a user.
Fault detection in HVDC-connected wind farm with full converter generator
 In HVDC-connected wind farms with full converter generator (FCG) the short-circuit currents are mainly governed by the control systems of HVDC and wind generators’ converters. This peculiarity requires accurate studies for the design and evaluation of reliable fault detection methods. In line with this need three-phase faults analyses have been performed on a test-case system, using PSCAD/EMTDC, and protection strategies have been proposed and analyzed.
Simulative and experimental investigation of transfer function of inter-turn faults in transformer windings
 The transfer function (TF) method is a powerful tool to detect inter-turn faults. Correct interpretation of the TF variations is significant to distinguish the inter-turn faults from less urgency defects. This paper investigates transfer functions of inter-turn faults in transformer windings using simulative and experimental approach. An improved lumped circuit (ILC) model was developed to investigate the detailed energy transmission mode between adjacent turns. Actual experiments of inter-turn faults in different levels were carried out on a purpose-made winding by shorting the adjacent turns with different value resistors to verify the simulative results. Simulative and experimental results show the same characteristics of TF variations. The resonance frequency increases with rising transmission energy in shorting resistance. The amplitudes of resonance frequency vary in a U-shaped trend, which is determined by the energy consumed in the shorting resistance.
Instantaneous power factor signature analysis for efficient fault diagnosis in inverter fed three phased induction motors
 Majority of the electricity used in the industry is consumed by induction motors. Early detection of abnormal cases that occur at the electrical and mechanical parts of these motors is very important for the safe operation of industrial facilities and the decrease of economic losses. In this presented study, the detection of parallel, angular and mixed misalignment fault in inverter fed induction motors has been carried out via the harmonic analysis of the instantaneous power factor signal. Results obtained from experimental studies carried out under different speed and loads indicated that the detection of misalignment fault can be carried out successfully. The presented method can be used effectively without any additional cost since inverter fed motors have both voltage and current sensors. Also online monitoring of induction motors with the suggested method not only improves the motor's performance and longevity but also its efficiency. The main innovative parts of this study is that instantaneous power factor signal was used at the first time for detection of misalignment faults.
A method for the evaluation of fault current distribution in complex high voltage networks
 The paper presents a method for the study of large interconnected earthing systems in High Voltage networks. The mathematical model proposed for calculating the distribution of the Single-line-to-Earth fault current is useful for a methodical and accurate analysis of complex systems having meshed configuration and more sources, and has practical application for the Transmission System Operator. Two case studies are provided. The first one considers a fault occurring inside and outside a station in a real 220 kV transmission network. In the second example, the proposed methodology is compared with the classical “Double-sided elimination” method.
Data-based Fault Identification and Accommodation in the Control of Sampled-Data Particulate Processes
 This study deals with the problem of actuator fault identification and accommodation in particulate processes with discretely sampled measurements. The methodology involves reducing the infinite-dimensional system describing the particulate process to obtain a finite-dimensional model that captures the process dominant dynamics. A state feedback controller is designed based on the reduced-order model, and a zero-order hold, inter-sample model predictor is used to compensate for the discrete availability of measurements. The inter-sample model predictor is updated at each sampling time once the actual measurements become available. The location and magnitude of the actuator faults are estimated at each sampling time by solving a moving-horizon least-squares optimization problem online. The closed-loop stability properties of the sampled-data system are explicitly characterized in terms of the sampling period, the controller design parameters, and the actuator effectiveness (absence or extent of malfunction), which are subsequently used in the fault accommodation approach that maintains closed-loop stability after a fault occurs. The ability of the proposed methodology to identify and handle simultaneous and consecutive, as well as full and partial faults, are illustrated using a simulated model of a non-isothermal continuous crystallizer.
Differential energy based relaying for thyristor controlled series compensated line
 The paper presents a differential energy based protection scheme for transmission line including Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) using time–frequency transform such as S-transform. Initially the current at sending and receiving ends are retrieved and processed through the time–frequency transform such as S-transform to generate the time–frequency patterns (frequency contours). Spectral energy content of the frequency contours of both current signals are calculated and differential energy is computed to register the fault patterns in the transmission line. The tripping signal can be issued based on a set threshold, within two cycles from the fault inception, meeting the speed criteria of the digital relay. The results indicate that the differential energy based protection scheme can reliably detect the fault patterns in TCSC line including wide variations in operating conditions of the faulted power network.
Internal fault detection techniques for power transformers
 This paper presents the methodologies for incipient fault detection in power transformers both off-line and on-line. An artificial neural network is used to detect faults off-line with dissolved gas analysis reports of transformers and whereas wavelet transforms are being used for on-line fault detection. The accuracy in fault detection through artificial neural networks is compared with Rogers ratio method using the analysis of experimental oil samples for power transformers of power companies in Andhra Pradesh, India. The Wavelet transform techniques have been developed with different mother wavelets to detect incipient faults and to distinguish between incipient fault and short circuit fault. Further their performances with different mother wavelets are compared.
Mitigation of induced voltages and AC corrosion effects on buried gas pipeline near to OHTL under normal and fault conditions
 In this paper the induced voltages along the length of the buried gas pipeline, due to the inductive coupling and conductive coupling between this pipeline and the overhead transmission line (OHTL), are calculated under normal and fault conditions of the OHTL. Also, this paper deals with the mitigation of these induced voltages. Fault conditions of the OHTL include symmetric and un-symmetric faults. Where, ATP software is used to simulate the OHTL under all fault conditions. The obtained results from the ATP program are used to calculate the pipeline induced voltages under both normal and fault conditions. Mitigation system to minimize the impact of the OHTL on pipelines at normal and fault conditions is designed. Under normal condition, the pipeline induced voltages, after earthing system (mitigation system) was erected, are measured and compared with the calculated values. Also, pipeline coating discharging current and pipeline AC current density due to inductive coupling under normal operation and due to inductive and conductive coupling under single phase to ground fault condition of the OHTL, before and after erecting the mitigation system, are calculated and analyzed.
Characteristics of the fault-related rocks, fault zones and the principal slip zone in the Wenchuan Earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling Project Hole-1 (WFSD-1)
 Scientific drilling in active faults after a large earthquake is ideal to study earthquake mechanisms. The Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project (WFSD) is an extremely rapid response to the 2008 Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, which happened along the Longmenshan fault, eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In order to better understand the fault mechanism and the physical and chemical characteristics of the rocks, the WFSD project will eventually drill 5 boreholes along the two main faults. This paper focuses on the first hole (WFSD-1), which started just 178 days after the earthquake, down to a final depth of 1201.15 m. Petrological and structural analyses of the cores allowed the identification of fault-related rocks in the Yingxiu–Beichuan fault (fault gouge, cataclasite, and fault breccia), and the Principle Slip Zone (PSZ) location of the Wenchuan earthquake was determined. We found 12 fault zones in the entire core profile, with at least 10, including the Yingxiu–Beichuan fault zone, with a multiple cores structure and minimum width of ~ 100 m. The co-seismic slip plane of the Wenchuan earthquake at depth (corresponding to the Yingxiu–Beichuan fault zone at the outcrop), as well as its PSZ, was expected to be located at the bottom of the fault zone (at 759 m-depth). Instead, it was found at ~590 m-depth with 1 cm-wide fresh fault gouge, as determined by logging data such as temperature, natural gamma ray, p-wave velocity and resistivity, combined with the fresh appearance, magnetic susceptibility, and microstructure of the gouge. The Wenchuan earthquake slip plane has a dip angle of ~ 65°, showing the high-angle thrust feature. The distribution of fault gouge with several meters thick, the location of the Wenchuan earthquake's PSZ and the thickness of fresh gouge all imply a correlation between the width of the fault zone and the number of seismic events.
Study of protection scheme for transmission line based on wavelet transient energy
 Wavelet transient energy is proposed to be the criterion of protection for distinguishing internal or external fault on transmission line in this paper. The modal voltage and current are decomposed by Daubechies 4 wavelet in both time and frequency. The different decomposition coefficients on different scales reflecting different frequency information are used to calculate the transient characteristic of voltage and current. The transient characteristic is then utilized to obtain the transient energy of the fault that is employed to identify the fault position. Simulation results show that the proposed protection scheme based on transient energy is applicable and encouraging. It is independent of fault type, switching angle and generation mode; not influenced by recloser and lightning surge. Single-line ground fault with high fault resistance can also be detected correctly. The proposed protection scheme has good selectivity, reliability and sensitivity.
Determining secondary arc extinction time for single-pole auto-reclosing based on harmonic signatures
 In this paper, a new algorithm based on harmonic signatures is proposed to detect extinction of secondary arc for single-pole auto-reclosing (SPAR). In the proposed algorithm, the TT-transform is used to highlight harmonics of healthy phase voltages. The criterion for the detection of extinction of secondary arc is harmonics amplitudes, which is calculated after the TT-transform. The algorithm is noncommunication and the threshold value is adaptive; therefore, for various transmission systems no special adjustment is needed. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed scheme, numerous simulations under different conditions including fault location, fault inception angle and line compensation are performed, in all of which the highest reliability is achieved.
A methodology to quantify the gas supply capacity of natural gas transmission pipeline system using reliability theory
 A methodology to quantify the gas supply capacity of a natural gas transmission pipeline system is developed in this paper. The methodology is based on reliability theory and hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow. Considering the state transition process and change law of the flow rate, two reliability indicators, gas supply satisfaction (Sa) and gas supply supportability (Su), are proposed to quantify the gas supply capacity. The methodology is first able to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each operating state based on Monte Carlo approach, and then the hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow after the system transits to others states is applied to analyze the change law of the actual flow rate through the commercial software SPS (Stoner Pipeline Simulator). By combining the hydraulic analysis into the simulation of state transition process, the two reliability indicators are calculated. A detailed procedure for gas supply capacity evaluation of a natural gas transmission pipeline system is presented, and its feasibility is confirmed with two case studies including a hypothesis and a real transmission pipeline system. Furthermore, impacts of the line pack, availability of the components and the number of stand-by units on the gas supply capacity are investigated.
Amplitude and frequency demodulation analysis for fault diagnosis of planet bearings
 The vibration signals of planet bearings feature more complex amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) than those of fixed-axis bearings, due to the effects of time-varying vibration transfer path, load zone passing and time-varying angles between gear pair mesh lines of action and impact force vector, in addition to that of bearing fault. Their Fourier spectra have a complex sideband structure, leading to difficulty in feature extraction and fault diagnosis. In order to address this issue, a joint amplitude and frequency demodulation analysis method is proposed to reveal the fault features, by considering the modulation characteristics. To thoroughly understand planet bearing vibration characteristics, the explicit equations for amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra of outer race, rolling element and inner race fault cases are derived, and the fault symptoms are summarized respectively. The signal is firstly decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), thus meeting the mono-component requirement by instantaneous frequency calculation. Then a sensitive component with the instantaneous frequency fluctuating around the resonance frequency is chosen for further frequency demodulation analysis. Finally, planet bearing fault can be diagnosed by matching the peaks identified in amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra with the theoretical fault characteristic frequencies. The proposed method is validated with both numerical simulated and lab experimental signal analyses.
Application of an improved maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution method for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings
 The extraction of periodic impulses, which are the important indicators of rolling bearing faults, from vibration signals is considerably significance for fault diagnosis. Maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD) developed from minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) has been proven as an efficient tool for enhancing the periodic impulses in the diagnosis of rolling element bearings and gearboxes. However, challenges still exist when MCKD is applied to the bearings operating under harsh working conditions. The difficulties mainly come from the rigorous requires for the multi-input parameters and the complicated resampling process. To overcome these limitations, an improved MCKD (IMCKD) is presented in this paper. The new method estimates the iterative period by calculating the autocorrelation of the envelope signal rather than relies on the provided prior period. Moreover, the iterative period will gradually approach to the true fault period through updating the iterative period after every iterative step. Since IMCKD is unaffected by the impulse signals with the high kurtosis value, the new method selects the maximum kurtosis filtered signal as the final choice from all candidates in the assigned iterative counts. Compared with MCKD, IMCKD has three advantages. First, without considering prior period and the choice of the order of shift, IMCKD is more efficient and has higher robustness. Second, the resampling process is not necessary for IMCKD, which is greatly convenient for the subsequent frequency spectrum analysis and envelope spectrum analysis without resetting the sampling rate. Third, IMCKD has a significant performance advantage in diagnosing the bearing compound-fault which expands the application range. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of IMCKD are validated by a number of simulated bearing fault signals and applying to compound faults and single fault diagnosis of a locomotive bearing.
Wavelet-based analysis and detection of traveling waves due to DC faults in LCC HVDC systems
 This paper presents qualitative and quantitative analysis of the traveling waves induced by faults on direct current (DC) transmission lines of line-commutated converter high-voltage direct current (LCC HVDC) systems for detecting the wavefront arrival times using the boundary wavelet coefficients from real-time stationary wavelet transform (RT-SWT). The qualitative analysis takes into account the steady-state operation and the detection of the inception times of both first and second wavefronts at the converter stations. The behavior of the boundary wavelet coefficients in DC transmission lines is examined considering the effects of the main parameters that influence the detection of the traveling waves, such as mother wavelets, sampling frequency, DC transmission line terminations, electrical noises, as well as fault resistance and distance. An algorithm designed to run in real-time and able to minimize the factors that hamper the performance of traveling wave-based protection (TWP) methods is proposed to detect the first and second surge arrival times. Quantitative results are achieved based on the accuracy of one- and two-terminal fault location estimation methods, and indicate the proper operation of the presented algorithm.
Traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator driven by a multistage traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine
 A double-loop-type traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator driven by a multistage traveling-wave engine was constructed. To reduce the onset temperature for thermoacoustic oscillations and achieve a refrigerator temperature of −100 °C, three etched stainless steel mesh regenerators were installed close to the sweet spot within the prime mover loop and one regenerator was fixed in the refrigerator loop. The maximum measured COP of the whole system at −50 °C, was 0.029. Gas oscillations occurred when the hot temperature of the regenerator in the prime mover loop exceeded 85 °C. On the other hand, refrigeration (−42.3 °C) was observed when the hot heat exchanger temperature reached 90 °C, which is lower than the boiling point of water. Furthermore, the refrigerator achieved a minimum cold temperature of −107.4 °C when the hot temperature was 270 °C.
Four-stage loop-type cascade traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine
 We designed and built a prototype of a loop-type cascade traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine with four regenerators. The objective with this prototype engine was to achieve both high acoustic impedance at the regenerator position and a traveling-wave field in ducts, and to amplify the acoustic power by a factor equal to the number of regenerators. To achieve this objective, we enlarged the regenerator cross-sectional area and incremented the duct diameter. We measured and analyzed the acoustic field and verified that its characteristics met the objectives.
The Development of a Two-stage Traveling Wave Thermoacoustic Engine
 An adjustable two-stage traveling wave thermoacoustic engine (TWTE) was designed and fabricated and the maximum input power of the system is 4800W. The adjustability is mainly reflected in the length of the regenerator, the self-resonance frequency of the system, the relative position of the two thermoacoustic units and the phase of pressure wave and velocity wave. An extrusion hard-sealing type was used in the thermoacoustic core, which can improve the heating efficiency and simplify the machining process. A water cooling system was utilized to calculate the heat loss and recycle the chilling water. This paper mainly discusses the system construction of the thermoacoustic engine and the experiment results will presented in the near future.
Automatic lightning stroke location on transmission lines using data mining and synchronized initial travelling
 The automatic location of lightning stroke impact point on transmission lines is one of the most crucial factors related to the behavior of Electric Power Systems, which can improve the swift recovery of electric power. The usual location of this phenomenon has been based on distance protection relays, which requires operation times of approximately one cycle. This paper presents a high-speed protection approach for the lightning-caused transient automated location on transmission lines or on ground. This work is based on the synchronized initial voltage-travelling waves at both ends of high voltage transmission lines. Lightning strikes at different sections along the 220 kV transmission line are detected at both protection relays by using an algorithm based on the ellipsoidal pattern previously presented in another research project. That methodology uses the projection of original signals. Thus, if these signals are located along the ellipsoidal pattern, the electric power system is operated under normal conditions. Unlike the aforementioned case, if the projected signals are located outside of the ellipsoidal pattern, it represents the presence of lightning strokes. After those signals are detected, initial voltage traveling waves measured by protection relays located at both ends of the transmission line are used in order to localize the lighting stroke impact point. At the instant that a lightning stroke hits either on the phase conductor or the ground, travelling waves propagate along the transmission line. Later on, depending on the impact point of atmospheric discharges, different time instances, which the travelling waves require to arrive at their respective ends, are determined. These times are used to calculate the distance from the impact point to both protection relays. Therefore, this paper presents a concise simple methodology for lightning stroke location on transmission lines or ground based in data mining to perform the signal detection and travelling wave times to determine the location along the transmission line. Simulations of lightning stroke signals on a 220 kV transmission line are carried out in the Alternative Transients Program (ATP). The results show that the behavior of the work is swift and effective in order to locate the impact point, especially in situations where flash current values, inception angles, distances from the impact point to protection relays, direct and indirect lightning and other factors, are considered, since it is immune to flash currents and other features. Finally, the proposed work could be considered as an alternative routine for protection relay algorithms
Fault location for power grid based on transient travelling wave data fusion via asynchronous voltage measurements
 Considering the complex topology of power grids and their important application, finding an effective fault location algorithm is mandatory. This paper presents a fault location method for power grid based on transient travelling wave data fusion and asynchronous voltage measurements. Firstly, the refraction regularity, attenuation rule and main factors affecting the amplitude of the initial travelling wave are analyzed. Then the modulus maxima of detail coefficients, treated as the feature variables of the initial travelling wave, are extracted via wavelet transform. At last, according to the configuration of the measuring points, fault location scheme based on data fusion theory is proposed. In data level fusion, phase-mode and wavelet transform are carried out in order to obtain the feature variables. In feature level fusion, the fault section is determined through the fault feature variables filtered by the network topology and the artificial neural network is used to fit the relationship between the fault distance and the time difference of arrival between single-terminal aerial-mode and zero-mode voltage. In decision level fusion, the double-terminal fault location algorithm based on the single-ended uploaded data is proposed. The IEEE 30-Bus System is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC and the fault location algorithm is carried out in MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrate that high-precision fault location could be realized and that practicality and economy are improved without requirements on synchronous sampling.
Development of a 5 kW traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator
 Traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engine is a new type of external combustion heat engine, which is capable of converting thermal energy to acoustic power with advantage of heat source flexibility, reliability and efficiency. The generated acoustic power will be further converted into electricity by connecting linear alternator with the engine. This power generation system is called traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator. In this paper, a new traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator is proposed, which consists of a multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engine and linear alternators. The engine has several units connected end-to-end by slim resonance tubes to obtain a traveling-wave acoustic field in the regenerator, which is required by an efficient thermoacoustic heat engine. The alternator is connected as a bypass at the end of each resonance tube. Here, a three-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator was developed. In the experiments, the maximum electric power of 4.69 kW with thermal-to-electric efficiency of 15.6% and the maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 18.4% with electric power of 3.46 kW were achieved with 6 MPa pressurized helium, 650 °C and 25 °C heating and cooling temperatures. Additionally, the influence of the electric capacitance on the system performance was investigated, which may provide some clue to couple the alternator with the engine. So far, this performance is the best one of such type of machines. It is believed that this technology will be suitable for many applications in the energy area, such as solar energy, industrial waste heat and so on.
A rotational traveling wave based levitation device – Modelling, design, and control
 Described is a device acting on an acoustically levitated object by manipulating the pressure and flow of a thin layer of air such that its rotation can be precisely controlled without mechanical contact. Virtual work analysis assists in simplifying the multi-actuator control problem into one governed by a single controllable parameter. Actuation is accomplished by a vibrating annulus capable of producing ultrasonic standing and traveling waves. Thus creating the acoustic excitation that affects the pressure in a thin, intermediate layer of gas. A distinctive vibration pattern is required to generate the temporal and spatial pressure field of the squeezed air layer that gives rise to both acoustic levitation force and rotational torque. Described are the physical and design development stages leading to an optimized structure, all followed by verifying and dynamics-calibration experiments. Moreover, by precisely controlling the ratio of standing and traveling waves in the annulus, in a closed-loop, one can control the shear forces applied by the squeezed air layer, thus creating a non-contacting levitated object manipulation mechanism. Through an algebraic transformation, the over-actuated setup is converted to a simplified single control-parameter problem. The transformation links the standing waves ratio, and hence the rotational torque, to the amplitudes and phases of the actuators. This arrangement leads to an effective closed loop methodology that was implemented experimentally, showing good performance and exhibiting rapid angular positioning.
Fabrication of surface acoustic wave based wireless NO2 gas sensor

Subsequently PZT thin film has been deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique as a sensing layer over the fabricated SAW resonator. Shift in resonance frequency was measured precisely for varying concentration of NO2 gas. The calibration curve was found to be linear having a sensitivity of 9.6 Hz/ppm. The fabricated sensor is advantageous for its room temperature, handheld and wireless sensing.
Acoustic wave propagation in a sensor port: Experimental measurements and analytical model predictions
 In this paper, results from an experimental study on pressure fluctuations in a sensor port are presented. The sensor ports are attached to a large flat plate over which plane acoustic waves propagate. In addition, an analytical model is developed by solving the acoustic wave equation subject to rigid and pressure release boundary conditions. The experimental data is used as input to the model from one end of the sensor port in order to predict the pressure fluctuations at the other end of the sensor port. Two sensor ports are used; a short and a long one. The short sensor port resonates at 1000 Hz, whereas the long sensor port resonates at 245 Hz. The acoustic source generates harmonic and random plane acoustic waves, which can be modeled easily. Pressure fluctuation measurements are made both on the plate surface and inside the sensor ports for various plane wave inputs; harmonic and random. Power spectra, sound pressure levels and transfer functions are then obtained at the various microphone locations. The experimental results for the short sensor port show an amplification factor of 45 between the inlet and the rigid end of the sensor port at a frequency of 1000 Hz. For the long sensor port, the amplification is nearly 50 at a frequency of 245 Hz, with lower amplifications at higher frequencies. Using the measured power spectrum at the rigid end of the sensor port for a random plane wave input, the absorption coefficient is calculated using the half-power law. Using this absorption coefficient in our analytical model, predictions were made at both ends of the sensor port using experimental data as input. The model predictions for both sensor ports are in good agreement with experimental data.
Interaction of highly nonlinear solitary waves with rigid polyurethane foams
 Experiments and simulations are performed to study the interaction of solitary waves in a granular crystal with a plastically compressible and rate-sensitive test medium in the form of rigid polyurethane (PU) foam. We study the effects of the foam's compressive strength and elastic modulus on the nonlinear wave dynamics near the interface and on the formation of reflected solitary waves. Experiments are conducted using a granular crystal composed of a vertical array of spherical steel particles, directly contacting the foamed polyurethane samples. Single solitary waves are generated in the chain through striker particle impact, and the temporal profiles of the incident and reflected solitary waves are recorded by placing an instrumented sensor particle in the chain. The measurements show that travel time and wave amplitude of the reflected solitary waves are highly sensitive to the elasto-plastic properties of the inspection medium, particularly when the intensity of the incident solitary waves is increased. The measurements were compared to the predictions obtained with a coupled discrete/finite element model and good agreement was reported. The predictions show that when the amplitude of the incident solitary wave increases, the response transitions from an elastic regime to a regime dominated by plastic compression.
Thermoacoustic travelling-wave cooler driven by a cascade thermoacoustic engine
 This paper proposes a novel configuration of a cooler driven by a cascade thermoacoustic engine. It consists of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine, a travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine and a travelling-wave thermoacoustic cooler in series. The engines provide acoustic energy to drive the cooler. The three main components have a linear topology without the need for using feedback loops. Modelling and simulation of the cascade arrangement, together with the experimental results, are described in this paper. In the presented system, an acoustic absorption element is adopted to induce a higher acoustic power transfer, which increases the travelling-wave component in the acoustic field. It makes the regenerators of both the travelling-wave engine and cooler work in the travelling-wave phase region and allows the thermoacoustic performance offered by both the travelling-wave and the standing-wave to be utilized more effectively.
Using a side-branched volume to tune the acoustic field in a looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine with a RC load
 Travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine utilises a compact acoustic network to obtain a right time-phasing between the acoustic velocity and pressure oscillations within the regenerator to force gas parcels to experience a Stirling-like thermodynamic cycle. As such, thermal energy can be converted to mechanical work (i.e., high-intensity pressure waves). It is therefore crucial to control the time-phasing carefully to improve the performance of thermoacoustic engines. Various ways have been proposed and demonstrated for adjusting time-phasing, including both passive and active methods. The aim of this study is to introduce a new passive phase tuning method (i.e., a side-branched acoustic volume) to tune the time-phasing within a looped-tube travelling wave thermoacoustic engine. The proposed concept has been investigated both numerically and experimentally in this research. An experimental rig was simulated and designed using DeltaEC software (Design Environment for Low-amplitude ThermoAcoustic Energy Conversion). It was then constructed according to the obtained theoretical model. The result of this study showed a qualitative agreement between experimental measurement and numerical simulations, demonstrating that the proposed technique can effectively adjust the phase angle between the acoustic velocity and pressure oscillations within the loop-tube thermoacoustic engines, and improve its performance.
Parameters identification and contact analysis of traveling wave ultrasonic motor based on measured force and feedback voltage
 In previous studies, contact models of traveling-wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM) only considered the effect of the preload on the resonance frequency, and were based on theoretical calculations or assumptions because vibration parameters in working conditions are hard to measure. In this paper, a novel model and measurement method for contact analysis of TWUSM are proposed. The proposed measurement method enables the determination of vibration parameters during motor operation. Our model differs from previous reported models in three aspects: vibration parameters are identified based on measured force and feedback voltage rather than theoretical assumptions; the simultaneous effects of the preload force on the resonance frequency and vibration amplitude were analyzed and validated; some phenomena in working conditions, such as the starting-up voltages and working ranges under different preload forces, can be predicted and analyzed. The feasibility and effectiveness of this model was verified by the good agreement between the measured and calculated results. Our work provides a very useful and convenient way for performance prediction, working range choice and control of TWUSM.
Optimal number and location of Bluetooth sensors considering stochastic travel time prediction
 Determining the optimal number and location of sensors is essential to effectively manage traffic on highways. Optimal solutions dealing with dynamic traffic patterns and relocation of sensors have received little attention. In this study, existing fixed sensors are used to estimate travel time prediction errors at candidate locations where we deploy portable sensors. Potential sampling error of each candidate location is also counted in selecting optimal locations. A two-stage stochastic formulation considers uncertainty of traffic conditions based on scenarios generated by principal component analysis and clustering analysis to uncover the underlying spatial correlations and temporal patterns. The first stage decision, determining the optimal number of sensors, is made before the deployment. The second stage, evaluating the expected travel time prediction errors, specifies sensor arrangements in each scenario. A dynamic model has predefined rearrangement stages. At each stage, sensor locations are modified as the pattern of travel time error changes over time, considering sensor acquisition and relocation expenses. The deterministic and stochastic solutions serve as a lower bound and an upper bound for the dynamic solution. Higher relocation expense leads to more sensors being used, while higher sensor costs leads to fewer sensors being used with more frequent relocations.
A two-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator with loudspeakers as alternators
 This paper presents the design, construction and tests of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator. A two-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine converts thermal energy to acoustic power. Two low-impedance linear alternators (i.e., audio loudspeakers) were installed to extract and convert the engine’s acoustic power to electricity. The coupling mechanism between the thermoacoustic engine and alternators has been systematically studied numerically and experimentally, hence the optimal locations for installing the linear alternators were identified to maximize the electric power output and/or the thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. A ball valve was used in the loop to partly correct the acoustic field that was altered by manufacturing errors. A prototype was built based on this new concept, which used pressurized helium at 1.8 MPa as the working gas and operated at a frequency of about 171 Hz. In the experiment, a maximum electric power of 204 W when the hot end temperature of the two regenerators reaches 512 °C and 452 °C, respectively. A maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 3.43% was achieved when the hot end temperature of the two regenerators reaches 597 °C and 511 °C, respectively. The research results presented in this paper demonstrate that multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator has a great potential for developing inexpensive electric generators.
A general fault location method in complex power grid based on wide-area traveling wave data acquisition
 With the development of wide-area measurement technology, it is possible to obtain the fault-originated traveling wave synchronously in a complex power grid. Based on the specialized deployment of the monitoring points and arrival time of initial traveling wave-front acquired by phase-mode transformation and wavelet transformation, this paper proposes a general method for fault-location in complex power grid. Manhattan distance is adopted to find out the accurate measuring combinations, by which the preliminary fault location is calculated. Then the accuracy and robustness of the results can be improved by the fault-occurrence time which is calculated by the information of monitoring points and grid topology relationship. All simulations are carried out in PSCAD and the IEEE 30-bus system is built in order to obtain the synchronization fault signals. The simulation result proves that the proposed method has high accuracy. The uncertainty of the measurement errors is also included in the simulation and shows that the algorithm has high robustness.
Dual transduction on a single sensor for gas identification
 Poor selectivity is one important limitation of gas sensors based on chemisorption or physisorption. This poor selectivity is usually tackled through the use of a gas sensor array, whose individual elements have diverse selectivity. Gas identification can be achieved by analyzing the unique response patterns of the sensor array. However, such an approach is costly due to its complexity. In this paper, we investigate an alternative solution enabling single sensor gas identification through the integration of two transduction mechanisms in one sensor. We demonstrate this approach through the design of a novel dual transduction gas sensor capable of simultaneously detecting gas-induced variations in the mass and resistance of the sensing material. The relative independence of acquired gravimetric and resistive responses is shown to enable subsequent gas identification. In addition, the proposed approach can also improve the overall limit of detection (LOD) to different gases by exploiting the individual responses with the best LODs. The proposed dual transduction gas sensor was implemented by integrating a film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR) together with interdigitated electrodes. A configurable dual-mode oscillator circuit is also proposed to simultaneously read-out both responses from the sensor.
Demonstration for a two-axis interferometric tilt sensor in KAGRA
 Recently, a folded Mach–Zehnder interferometer with homodyne in- and quadrature-phase detection was proposed as a high-precision, wide-dynamic range tilt sensor. By way of a practical application and to validate actual performance, two-axis tilt sensors were developed and installed for one mirror of the input mode cleaner cavity in KAGRA, the large-scale cryogenic gravitational-wave telescope in Kamioka, Gifu, Japan. Building on previous work, we have demonstrated that the two-axis tilt sensor has properly sensed the tilt angle changes of the mirror motion with high precision and without calibration. Compared with our initial angular sensor, an optical lever, which is calibrated by using the interferometer tilt sensor, we found that both sensors showed actual tilt motions of the mirror at low frequencies, and the two-axis interferometer sensor has a better sensitivity at higher frequencies.
Traveling Waves in Visual Cortex
 Electrode recordings and imaging studies have revealed that localized visual stimuli elicit waves of activity that travel across primary visual cortex. Traveling waves are present also during spontaneous activity, but they can be greatly reduced by widespread and intensive visual stimulation. In this Review, we summarize the evidence in favor of these traveling waves. We suggest that their substrate may lie in long-range horizontal connections and that their functional role may involve the integration of information over large regions of space.
Atmospheric gravity wave ray tracing: Ordinary and extraordinary waves
 Calculation of internal gravity-wave ray paths in the atmosphere using a general three-dimensional ray tracing computer program is discussed. To initialize a ray-path calculation, it is necessary to specify the initial values for the components of the wave vector at the source so that the dispersion relation is satisfied. For acoustic waves, or for gravity waves in the absence of wind, there is no ambiguity in determining the magnitude of the wave vector once the frequency and direction of propagation (wave-normal direction) have been specified. For gravity waves with wind, however, it is necessary to solve a quartic equation to specify the magnitude of the wavenumber. Two of the roots of the quartic reduce to the usual solutions in the absence of wind, and we designate these roots as ‘ordinary waves.’ The two new roots (whose values approach infinity as the wind speed approaches zero), we designate as ‘extraordinary waves.’ A section contrasts the properties of the different gravity wave types. Comparison with some previously published examples of ray-path calculations of gravity waves shows that those previous examples were actually extraordinary waves, but their significance was not recognized at that time. In the absence of wind, gravity waves are restricted to a fan of propagation directions centered about horizontal propagation, but asymptotic gravity waves (in the Bousinesq approximation) have a fixed propagation direction for a given frequency. In the presence of a horizontal wind, however, the wave-normal direction is restricted to a fan of directions in the upwind direction, but not in the downwind direction. The ray direction for upwind propagation has no restrictions. A short review of gravity wave theory and the gravity wave dispersion relation is included.
In-pipe fibre optic pressure sensor array for hydraulic transient measurement with application to leak detection
 Controlled hydraulic transient pressure waves can be used to actively assess the condition of pressurised pipelines (e.g. leak detection). One practical challenge to the application of the technique to buried water pipelines is in the pressure measurement – fast-response pressure transducers are costly and the deployment is limited to one sensor per access point (e.g. at air valves or fire hydrants). The measurement from a single sensor is always the superposition of the waves travelling upstream and downstream along a pipe. It is often difficult to determine the direction of the propagating waves, unless there are suitable locations nearby where additional measurements can be made. The research reported here develops a fibre optic pressure sensor array for in-pipe transient pressure measurement. The sensor array consists of five Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs), each formed into a custom designed pressure transducer. The cable containing the array has a diameter of approximately 4 mm, making it easy to insert into a pipeline through a single access point for distributed transient pressure measurement. The usefulness of the fibre optic pressure sensors for transient-based pipeline leak detection is validated through laboratory experiments. The measurement from each individual fibre optic sensor is generally consistent with conventional piezo-resistive pressure transducers over a wide frequency range. The sensor array configuration enables the determination of the directional information of waves, therefore enhancing the ability of pipeline defect detection and localisation.
Experimental and numerical investigation of transversal traveling surface waves for drag reduction
 The active drag reduction impact of spanwise transversal surface waves on a turbulent boundary layer is investigated experimentally and numerically. The actuated surface in the experimental setup is an insert in a flat aluminum plate being excited by an electromagnetic actuator system. Particle-image velocimetry and μ-particle-tracking velocimetry measurements are conducted to determine the local drag reduction downstream of the actuated surface. Furthermore, large-eddy simulations are performed to corroborate that the overall friction decrease can be determined by the local skin friction measurements downstream of the actuated surface. The Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness located directly downstream of the actuated surface is Reθ=1300. The spanwise traveling wave has an amplitude of A+=9, a wave length of λ+=3862, and a period of T+=115. The experimental and numerical results of the velocity distributions show an excellent agreement upstream and downstream of the actuated surface. The low amplitude which is caused by the actuation constraints due to the technically relevant material aluminum leads to low drag reduction values of 1.27% and 0.89% in the simulation and the measurement. A dominant influence of the transition from the actuated wall to the non-actuated surface is excluded. Thus, a detection of the impact of the wall motion by local skin friction measurements downstream of the actuated surface is feasible.
Characterization of piezoelectric wafer active sensor for acoustic emission sensing
 In this article, a new avenue of using the piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS) for detecting the fatigue crack generated acoustic emission (AE) signals is presented. In-situ AE-fatigue experiments were conducted using PWAS along with two commercially available AE sensors. It has been shown that the PWAS and existing AE sensors successfully captured the AE signals from the fatigue crack growth in a thin aerospace specimen. Two experiments were conducted using the PWAS with each of the commercial AE sensors. For each experiment, two AE analyses were performed: (1) the hit-based analysis, (2) the waveform-based analysis. The fatigue loading was synchronized with the AE measurements. This allowed comparing the AE hits due to a particular AE event captured by PWAS and the other sensors. All the sensors showed a very similar pattern of AE hits as observed from the hit-based analysis. The AE waveform-based analysis was used to compare the waveforms and their frequency spectra captured by the three sensors. The commercial PICO showed ringing in the AE signals and showed a weak response in high-frequency region. The commercial S9225 had better signal-to-noise ratio but it also showed a weak response in high-frequency region. It was found that all sensors captured the low-frequency flexural modes of the guided acoustic waves. However, the high-frequency acoustic wave signals were predominately captured by the PWAS. The AE waveform-based analysis provided more insight of the AE source and guided wave propagation modes.
Investigation on a 1 kW traveling-wave thermoacoustic electrical generator
 Traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engine is a special device capable of converting external heat to acoustic work with high reliability and high potential efficiency. By coupling with a linear alternator, it can be further developed as a new kind of electricity generator called the traveling-wave thermoacoustic electrical generator. In this paper, a prototype of 1 kW traveling-wave thermoacoustic electrical generator was designed and tested. In the preliminary experiments, due to the high clearance seal loss caused by the pistons of the alternator, only 638 W electric power with 16.6% thermal-to-electrical efficiency was obtained, which was far below our expectation. After further investigation, the acoustic impedance coupling relationship between the engine and alternator was first revealed by means of numerical approach. According to this relationship, the working frequency was decreased in the experiments from 74 Hz to 64 Hz by charging 4.5% mole fraction argon gas into the system. And a maximum electric power of 1043 W with a thermal-to-electrical efficiency of 17.7% and a maximum thermal-to-electrical efficiency of 19.8% with an electric power were of 970 W were obtained successfully. Other operating conditions were a mean pressure of 4.0 MPa, a heating temperature of 650 °C and a cooling temperature of 15 °C. So far, the output electric power and efficiency are the highest values for such a thermoacoustic electrical generator. This work presents a new kind of thermal electric power generator, which is believed to be suitable for many applications in the energy area, such as solar energy, industrial waste heat and so on.
On the dispersion equation for linear waves traveling through or over dense arrays of vertical cylinders
 Sloshing tests are performed on a rectangular tank filled with bottom-mounted vertical cylinders. The cylinders, in regular staggered arrangements, are first emergent then shortened to be fully submerged. Different porosities are achieved by varying the number of cylinders. The tank undergoes forced horizontal motion at frequencies around the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode. The free surface elevation and the hydrodynamic loads are measured. When resonance is attained, it means that the wavelength is exactly twice the length of the tank and that this wavelength and the sloshing frequency are related by a specific dispersion equation. From literature several theoretical dispersion equations are proposed in the emergent and submerged cases. New dispersion equations are offered based on the cylinder cluster being considered as an anisotropic porous medium. The latter ones provide the best agreement with the experimental results.
The effect of nonlinear traveling waves on rotating machinery
 The effect of the housing stiffness on nonlinear traveling waves is presented in this work. It was found that the housing controls the synchronization of nonlinear elements and it allows nonlinear waves to travel through the structure. This phenomenon was observed in a gearbox with a soft housing, and the phenomenon was reproduced with a lump-mass dynamic model. The model included a pair of gears, the rolling bearings and the housing. The model considered all the nonlinear effects. Numerical and experimental results were analyzed with a time–frequency method using the Morlet wavelet function. A compound effect was observed when the nonlinear waves travel between the gears and the bearings: the waves increased the dynamic load amplitude and add another periodic load.
Development of a CFD model for simulation of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine using an impedance matching boundary condition
 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have become prevalent tools in the numerical modeling of complex thermoacoustic phenomena. The basic problem concerning a CFD simulation of a complete system is the computational cost. To overcome this problem, a CFD simulation tool using an impedance matching boundary (IMB) condition has been developed to analyze the characterization of the flow field in a looped-tube traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine. The thermodynamic processes were simulated using a two-dimensional numerical solution for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. By imposing an impedance matching boundary condition, flow fields around the regenerator and heat-exchanger plates were simulated. The boundary condition being defined as an acoustic load which was derived from experimental data. From the simulations, features of the flow field such as nonlinear vortex generation around the regenerator and heat-exchanger plates were observed that were not present in the analytical solutions. Furthermore, the temperature oscillations were obtained around regenerator plates, and the operating mechanism of a looped-tube traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine was characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively. The CFD tool was validated by obtaining good agreement when comparing results with those from experimental data and analytical solutions. As a result, it was concluded that CFD simulations with this impedance matching boundary condition are effective in predicting actual flow behaviors in a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine.
A review of some advanced sensors used for health diagnosis of civil engineering structures
 The developments in structural health monitoring techniques have led to the invention of various sensors that can be effective damage indicator. Due to environmental or electromagnetic effects and need for constant energy source, the traditional sensors are unable to provide accurate and continuous measurements. In light of these events, new and improved sensors have been developed, along with wireless technology, to assist the monitoring process. With the need of detecting more than one damage parameters, multiplexed sensors have been the main interest of researchers. This paper deals with the different sensors used for determination of strain, acceleration and corrosion. A brief comparative study has been performed and presented in the following review paper. Multiplexed Fiber optics sensor have proved quite effective for SHM and proved to be a good competitor with other sensors. Optimum Sensor Placement technique developed for low level damage diagnosis is Iterated Improved Reduced System (IIRS) Method.
Debonding detection for rectangular CFST using surface wave measurement: Test and multi-physical fields numerical simulation
 The interfacial debonding detection approach for concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) members using surface-mounted piezoelectric-lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) actuators and sensors is experimentally and numerically investigated. In this study, an interfacial debonding detection approach using surface wave measurement with PZT patches is propoed firstly and experimental investigation on the feasibility of the proposed approach with two CFST specimens with different levels of interface debonding defects is carried out. For comparison, a PZT sensor is also embedded in concrete core to measure the stress wave traveling from the surface-mounted PZT actuator. Experiment results indicate that the voltage amplitude of the embedded PZT sensor representing the wave propagation from the steel plate into the concrete core decreases due to the existence of interfacial debonding defect, but the output signal of the surface-mounted PZT sensor increases accordingly when interface debonding occurs. Moreover, the increment of surface-mounted PZT sensor measurement is related to the dimension of the interface debonding defects. The experimental finding implies that the interface debonding is detectable using surface wave measurement. In order to investigate the mechanism of the proposed approach, numerical study on the wave propagation process in CFSTs is further discussed by using three-dimensional (3D) solid element models and two-dimensional (2D) plane strain models, respectively. Finally, in order to consider the effect of nonhomogeneous meso-scale structure of concrete on the wave propagation, a random aggregate method (RAM) is employed to model the concrete core and multi-physical fields coupling numerical analysis on stress wave propagation of the CFST member with different interface debonding defects is performed. The numerical findings meet well with the experimental observations and the results indicate that the interface debonding of CFST can be detected efficiently using surface wave measurement.
Turbulent drag reduction by spanwise traveling ribbed surface waves
 The combination of passive and active drag reduction techniques is investigated by particle-image velocimetry (PIV) and micro-particle tracking velocimetry (μ-PTV) measurements. To be more precise, the impact of a riblet-structured surface, which represents the passive control technique, undergoing spanwise transversal wave motion, which defines the active flow control method, on the wall-shear stress distribution of a zero-pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer is analyzed. The experimental setup consists of a flat plate equipped with an insert to generate a spanwise traveling wave on a riblet-structured aluminum sheet. The PIV and μ-PTV measurements are conducted downstream of the actuated riblet surface at two momentum thickness based Reynolds numbers Reθ=1200 and 2080. The surface deformation is generated by an electromagnetic actuator system at three amplitudes A=  0.25, 0.30, and 0.375 mm with a wavelength of λ=160  mm and a frequency of f=81  Hz. The nondimensional quantities in inner wall units defined by the friction velocity of the non-actuated flat plate flow at Reθ=1200 are the amplitudes A+=6, 7, and 9, the wavelength λ+=3862, and the frequency T+=110 and the corresponding quantities for Reθ=2800 are A+=11, 14 and 17, λ+=7170, and T+=380. The results are twofold. On the one hand, the combination of the riblet surface with the transversal wave motion increases the local drag reduction (DR). That is, compared to a boundary layer flow over a non-actuated smooth surface a local drag reduction of up to DR =9.4 % is determined at the chosen measurement position whereas the drag reduction due to the riblet surface is DR =4.7%. On the other hand, the dependence of the local drag reducing efficiency of the riblets on their geometric dimensions with respect to the flow field could be decreased. That is, the transversal wave motion extends the positive drag reducing efficiency range of the riblets.
Designing heterogeneous sensor networks for estimating and predicting path travel time dynamics: An information-theoretic modeling approach
 With a particular emphasis on the end-to-end travel time prediction problem, this paper proposes an information-theoretic sensor location model that aims to minimize total travel time uncertainties from a set of point, point-to-point and probe sensors in a traffic network. Based on a Kalman filtering structure, the proposed measurement and uncertainty quantification models explicitly take into account several important sources of errors in the travel time estimation/prediction process, such as the uncertainty associated with prior travel time estimates, measurement errors and sampling errors. By considering only critical paths and limited time intervals, this paper selects a path travel time uncertainty criterion to construct a joint sensor location and travel time estimation/prediction framework with a unified modeling of both recurring and non-recurring traffic conditions. An analytical determinant maximization model and heuristic beam-search algorithm are used to find an effective lower bound and solve the combinatorial sensor selection problem. A number of illustrative examples and one case study are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
Continuous cell from cell separation by traveling wave dielectrophoresis
 In this contribution we present a label-free continuous separation device for suspended-grown biological cells based on traveling wave dielectrophoresis (twDEP). Suspended-grown cells could otherwise only be separated by flow-cytometry which requires elaborate labeling steps. The chip consists of a structured PDMS layer on glass in which the channels have been defined. Parallel electrodes positioned along the microfluidic channel were used to expose selected cells to a twDEP force perpendicular to a pressure driven flow. With this device we have successfully separated viable Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Jurkat (T-cell leukemia) cells from a mix also containing cell culture debris, non-viable cells, and Lactobacillus casei bacteria.
Optical sensors
 The majority of optical displacement sensors are based on variable reflection or transmission. Optical force sensors are derived from displacement sensors by adding one or more spring elements. Since light is a wave, one can also make use of travel time (or ToF), phase shift and interference. First we discuss in this chapter the major optical variables and parameters. Next we review the properties of some commonly used electro-optical and optoelectric components as measurement tool. The subsequent section deals with methods on how to build up sensing systems for the measurement of position and displacement, using such components. Special attention is given to the position sensitive diode (PSD), optical triangulation, and interferometry. This section also includes a discussion on optical encoders (e.g., linear and angular, absolute, and incremental). The next section deals with some basic electronic interface circuits. Finally the last section is devoted to applications of optical sensing systems for linear and angular displacement, object shape and tracking, navigation, force, torque, and strain sensing.
Wave modelling in coastal and inner seas

After a short introduction, Chapter 2 deals with the basic processes at work and their modelling aspects. Chapter 3 highlights the interaction with wind and currents. Chapter 4 stresses the need for a more complete, spectral, approach in data assimilation. Chapter 5 summarizes the situation with a discussion on the present status in wave modelling and a look at what we can expect in the future.
Guided Wave Propagation and Damage Detection in Composite Pipes Using Piezoelectric Sensors
 Composite materials have many attractive properties, e.g. light-weight combined with high mechanical strength, and are recognized as an enabling technology for deep-water high pressure high temperature (HPHT) and corrosive environment applications. However, composite still has a barrier to entry in relation to steel due to limited field experience and lack of systematic failure prediction and assurance of in-service performance. Advances in such areas would enable the use of composites in a wider range of applications. Evaluation of in-service prototypes offers a partial solution but is costly. Thus a method that allows constant health monitoring of the composite in real-time and in-situ would be extremely useful. Ultrasonic guided wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) technology is one of the most prominent options in non-destructive evaluation and testing (NDE/NDT) techniques. To investigate the feasibility of guided wave-based SHM for composite pipes, propagation characteristics of guided waves in an epoxy hybrid carbon/glass fibres pipe are systematically studied using finite element (FE) simulation and experiments. Both axisymmetric modes of propagation, the longitudinal L(0,n) and torsional T(0,n) modes are considered in the simulation process, however only the longitudinal modes can be captured by the piezoelectric sensors. Additionally, the tuning curves experimentally plotted are used to obtain the frequency with the maximum amplitude of each guided mode. Finally, guided waves in the composite pipe are tested with artificial defects (gel coupled coins) to understand the behaviour of guided waves after interaction with the defects. The different condition of artificial defects, e.g., the defect size and defect location are studied to find out the proper condition and limitation of using guided waves to monitor and inspect composite pipes.
Design and experimental investigations on a small scale traveling wave thermoacoustic engine
 A small scale traveling wave or Stirling thermoacoustic engine with a resonator of only 1 m length was designed, constructed and tested by using nitrogen as working gas. The small heat engine achieved a steady working frequency of 45 Hz. The pressure ratio reached 1.189, with an average charge pressure of 0.53 MPa and a heating power of 1.14 kW. The temperature and the pressure characteristics during the onset and damping processes were also observed and discussed. The experimental results demonstrated that the small engine possessed the potential to drive a Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler.
Applying mobile phone data to travel behaviour research: A literature review
 Travel behaviour has been studied for decades to guide transportation development and management, with the support of traditional data collected by travel surveys. Recently, with the development of information and communication technologies (ICT), we have entered an era of big data, and many sources of novel data, including mobile phone data, have emerged and been applied to travel behaviour research. Compared with traditional travel data, mobile phone data have many unique features and advantages, which attract scholars in various fields to apply them to travel behaviour research, and a certain amount of progress has been made to date. However, this is only the beginning, and mobile phone data still have great potential that needs to be exploited to further advance human mobility studies. This paper provides a review of existing travel behaviour studies that have applied mobile phone data, and presents the progress that has been achieved to date, and then discusses the potential of mobile phone data in advancing travel behaviour research and raises some challenges that need to be dealt with in this process.
Active vibration control of finite L-shaped beam with travelling wave approach
 In this paper, the disturbance propagation and active vibration control of a finite L-shaped beam are studied. The dynamic response of the structure is obtained by the travelling wave approach. The active vibration suppression of the finite L-shaped beam is performed based on the structural vibration power flow. In the numerical calculation, the influences of the near field effect of the error sensor and the small error of the control forces on the control results are all considered. The simulation results indicate that the structural vibration response in the medium and high frequency regions can be effectively computed by the travelling wave method. The effect of the active control by controlling the power flow is much better than that by controlling the acceleration in some cases. And the control results by the power flow method are slightly affected by the locations of the error sensor and the small error of the control forces.
The influence of wave groups and wave-swash interactions on sediment transport and bed evolution in the swash zone
 Large scale laboratory measurements of sediment dynamics in the swash zone are presented. Two bichromatic wave group conditions were generated, having the same energy content but different wave group period (Tg=15.0 s and 27.7 s). For the shortest wave group, due to bore focusing, the shoreline fluctuates predominantly at the Tg time scale, showing a large runup and the presence of wave–swash interactions with strong momentum exchange. In contrast, for the longer wave groups, the swash excursion is dominated by the individual waves. The uprush generally promotes onshore sediment advection with consequent erosion at the rundown location but accretion close to the runup. On the contrary, the backwash promotes seaward sediment advection and accretion at the rundown location. The presence of repeated wave–swash interactions modifies these patterns slightly. A wave overrunning a previous uprush promotes a reduction in onshore sediment advection while weak wave–backwash interactions reduce seaward advection. Consequently, the measured sediment dynamics shows stronger intra–swash cross–shore sediment advection for the swash events produced by the short wave groups. Measurements of the sheet flow layer near the shoreline show that for the shortest wave groups the vertical structure of the concentration is influenced by horizontal advection, leading to large sheet-flow layer thickness. However, for the longer wave groups, the local vertical exchange of sediment in the sheet–flow layer is dominant, with the presence of a pick–up and mirroring upper layer similar to oscillatory sheet–flow measurements. These results reaffirm the important effects of the wave group structure and the wave–swash interactions on the swash zone sediment dynamics and beach face evolution.
Effect of leading waves on velocity distribution of undular bore traveling over sloping bottom
 For providing new insights into the effect of the leading waves on the velocity distribution of the generated bore, a case study of the undular bore (or weak bore) with the water depth ratio 1.70 is tested in a flume, using flow visualization technique (FVT) and high-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV). The undular bore, generated right downstream of a suddenly lifted gate, propagates first over a horizontal bottom and then travels over a 1:20 sloping bottom. The wave gauges were used to measure the free surface elevations of the generated bore at different positions. A complete evolution of the free surface elevations of the generated bore accompanied by the dispersive leading waves, measured at different shoreward positions, is elucidated first. Illustrations of variations in wave period and height of each leading wave in the onshore direction are also made. Based on visualized images and velocity fields measured, the following flow features at different stages of the generated bores are explored: (1) The temporal and spatial variations in the flow field of the generated bore with respect to passing of the leading waves; (2) The influence of the leading waves on shifting of the velocity distribution of the generated bore, along with illustrations of flow acceleration or deceleration in the onshore direction; (3) Flow reversal zone and shear layer formation near the sloping bottom; (4) Development of a vortex train (or street) in the shear layer between two opposite currents consisting of the onshore run-up flow and the offshore flow reversal right over the sloping bottom.
A solar-powered traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator
 Traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator is a new external-combustion type device capable of converting heat such as solar energy into electric power. In this paper, a 1 kW solar-powered traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generation system is designed and fabricated. The system consists of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator, a solar dish collector and a heat receiver. In the preliminary tests, using electric cartridge heaters to simulate the solar energy, a maximum electric power of 481 W and a maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 15.0% were achieved with 3.5 MPa pressurized helium and 74 Hz working frequency. Then, after integrating the traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator with the solar dish collector and the heat receiver, the solar-powered experiments were performed. In the experiments, a maximum electric power of about 200 W was obtained. However, due to the solar dish collector problems, the heating temperature of the receiver was much lower than expected. Optimizations of the collector and the heat receiver are under way.
Distributed travel-time seismic tomography in large-scale sensor networks
 Current geophysical techniques for visualizing seismic activity employ image reconstruction methods that rely on a centralized approach for processing the raw data captured by seismic sensors. The data is either gathered manually, or relayed by expensive broadband stations, and then processed at a base station. This approach is time-consuming (weeks to months) and hazardous as the task involves manual data gathering in extreme conditions. Also, raw seismic samples are typically in the range of 16–24 bit, sampled at 50–200 Hz and transferring this high fidelity sample from large number of sensors to a centralized station results in a bottleneck due to bandwidth limitations. To avoid these issues, a new distributed method is required which processes raw seismic samples inside each node and obtains a high-resolution seismic tomography in real time. In this paper, we present a component-averaged distributed multi-resolution evolving tomography algorithm for processing data and inverting volcano tomography in the network while avoiding centralized computation and costly data collection. The algorithm is first evaluated for the correctness using a synthetic model in a CORE emulator. Later, our proposed algorithm runs using the real data obtained from Mt. St. Helens, WA, USA. The results validate that our distributed algorithm is able to obtain a satisfactory image similar to centralized computation under constraints of network resources, while distributing the computational burden to sensor nodes.
Plastic fiber evanescent sensor in measurement of turbidity
 The construction and working principles of a plastic fiber sensor for examining the level of turbidity is studied in this paper. This work focuses on designing an inexpensive turbidity sensor that incorporates a pair of multimode fibers (MMF) that are attached side by side and their beveled tips are mounted vertically. The efficiency of different beveled angles is evaluated by simulation with Tracepro software. The reflected signal is collected by immersing the sensor head into a water mixture and analyzed for various concentration. It was found that there is a linear increment of output intensity when concentration of mixture is increased. The turbidity sensor is tested with real samples that are collected from lake, river and coastal areas to demonstrate its consistency with commercial apparatus in natural compounds. The results showed that the proposed sensor structure is able to produce reliable results in a dynamic range of detection from 0 to 1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) to facilitate practical field measurements.
Interaction of Lamb waves with the edges of a delamination in CFRP composites and a reference-free localization method for delamination
 Delamination is one of the most common types of damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. This paper analyzes the interaction of fundamental symmetric (S0) and anti-symmetric (A0) mode Lamb waves with the start and the end of a delamination using finite element simulations. Propagations of Lamb waves in a 4-layer [0/90]s laminate were compared with propagations obtained in a 1-layer [0] sub-laminate and in a 3-layer [90/90/0] sub-laminate, which are the two sub-laminates separated by the delamination. Results show that the Lamb waves travel at different velocities in the delaminated region and in the healthy region. Comparing the signals obtained in the delaminated region with the excitation, it was found that mode conversions happen at the edges of a delamination for both S0 and A0 waves. The mode conversion of S0 wave at the end of a delamination generates large A0 waves and causes most significant changes to the detection signal. Based on this feature, a reference-free localization method is proposed in this paper. By measuring the difference between the arrival times of two modes, the distance between pick-up sensor and the end of delamination can be estimated. This method was verified by signals obtained in finite element simulation.
Deposition and process development of AlN for MEMS acoustic sensor
 This paper describes a technique for fabrication of AlN based structure for MEMS acoustic sensor and similar applications. The AlN films of 2.1 μm thickness are grown on silicon substrates by reactive sputtering. The deposited films are characterized to determine the crystalline quality and piezoelectricity. Thermal annealing of the deposited films are performed at different temperatures for better piezoelectricity. The investigation showed a c-axis oriented AlN film is obtained at 600 °C temperature. A simple AlN based structure for MEMS acoustic sensor is fabricated on a thin silicon diaphragm. During fabrication of structure, a wet etching technique of AlN was developed. The reliability testing of fabricated structured was performed. The maximum current that can be passed across Al-deposited AlN edge was found to be 3.05 A without any damage. The investigations show a uniform Al step coverage on a 2.1 μm-thick AlN edge using proposed technique. The proposed technique for AlN etching reduces the process complexity and providing better reliability of fabricated structure. The resonance frequency of fabricated AlN based structure was measured and found to be 42.9 kHz.
Voltage travelling wave based smart re-closure for cables and overhead mixed lines
 With the rapid development of cities, more and more cables and overhead mixed lines are applied into electrical power network. It is difficult to define overhead line fault and cable fault, so whether to bring the re-closure into service is an urgent problem for operators to tackle. In order to solve this problem, a novel smart re-close scheme for cables with transmission lines based on voltage travelling wave is developed. Reclosing scheme is determined according to the result of fault location: re-closure signal is locked when cable fault happens, otherwise, be opened. Self-developed PCB sensor is adopted to extract voltage traveling wave and then detected by hardware circuit in the paper. Compared with traditional traveling wave detection, which requires high-speed A/D acquisition, the proposed approach has the advantage of low price, easy to realize and the positioning accuracy is less than 50 meters. In addition, the module of fault location-reclosing can be integrated in the relay protection. EMTP simulation results show that, the novel scheme is an effective and practical re-closure way for cables with transmission Lines.
Heat driven thermoacoustic cooler based on traveling–standing wave
 This paper presents a heat driven thermoacoustic cooler system without any moving part. It consists of a thermoacoustic engine and a thermoacoustic cooler, and the former is the driving source of the latter. Both the engine and the cooler are located in one loop tube coupled with a resonator tube, and the acoustic power produced by the engine is used to drive the cooler directly. Both regenerators of the engine and the cooler are located in the near region of the pressure antinode, and operate in traveling–standing wave phase region. In the engine’s regenerator, both components of the standing wave and the traveling wave realize the conversion from heat to acoustic energy. This improves the efficiency of the engine. In the cooler’s regenerator, both components of the traveling wave and the standing wave pump heat from the cold end. This improves the efficiency of the cooler. At the operating point with a mean pressure of 22 bar, helium as working gas, a frequency of 234 Hz, and a heating power of 300 W, the experimental cooler provides a no-load temperature of −30 °C and a cooling power of 40 W at the cooling temperature of 0 °C. The total length of this cooler system is less than 1 m, which shows a good prospect for the domestic cooler system in room-temperature cooling such as food refrigeration and air-conditioning.
Insights on vortex-induced, traveling waves on long risers
 This paper is based on portions of a keynote presentation, which explored the boundaries of what is understood about the vibration behavior of long cylinders excited by vortex shedding. The source of data is a recent field experiment on a long flexible cylinder, densely instrumented with fiber optic strain gauges. The paper emphasis is on previously unknown or unexplained phenomena and in some cases offers provocative insights as opposed to conclusive proofs. Three particular topics are covered: (i) the occurrence of peak strain and fatigue damage rates at unexpected locations, (ii) the dominance of traveling wave rather than standing wave response, and (iii) the appearance of stable cylinder trajectories, such as figure eights and crescents in pure traveling wave regions. Potential explanations are offered and areas for promising additional research are proposed.
Structural Health Monitoring system based on a concept of Lamb wave focusing by the piezoelectric array
 Piezoelectric transducer arrays are utilized in Structural Health Monitoring systems as a means for excitation and sensing of elastic waves. Anomalies of propagating waves have enabled to develop damage detection algorithms. Depending on actuation-sensing strategies these algorithms can be classified as pitch-catch and pulse-echo. Despite many signal processing methods such as delay-sum, time-reversal, probability-based diagnostic imaging, etc. the spatial damage information provided by the actuator-sensor paths to reconstruct the damage image is limited. A novel strategy based on Lamb wave focusing is proposed in order to increase damage imaging resolution. In the proposed method all actuators are used at the same time exciting specially designed waveforms so that inspect one specific point of the structure. Damage map is created by applying appropriate signal processing. It uses dispersion curve of selected Lamb wave mode for dispersion compensation. The dispersion curve is acquired by using laser scanning Doppler vibrometer. The damage indicator is calculated based on the energy of compensated signals registered by sensors. It is shown that apart from high energy level at excitation point, energy is concentrated exactly in the damaged region. An example of crack detection and visualization in an aluminum plate is shown confirming the accuracy of the proposed method. Also the proposed method is compared to well-established delay-and-sum algorithm.
Sensing comfort in bicycling in addition to travel data
 Bicycling is a key component of sustainable mobility. This paper gives an insight into the importance of bicycle-friendliness, also known as “bikeability” and its qualitative components like perception and emotions of the riders. The research applies a multi-methodical framework on bicycling aiming to identify stressful events on a bicycle ride. The goal was to test new bio-physiological sensors (like EDA device, eye tracker etc.) to develop a methodology on how sensor technologies can be integrated in the data collection processes and to discuss their practicability. The experiences in this field can help to foster a long-term integration of sensor technology into travel survey methodologies and further into transportation planning.
An experimental study on gravity waves through a floating viscoelastic cover
 We report the results of a laboratory study conducted to investigate the dispersion relation and attenuation of surface waves under viscoelastic floating covers. The study uses oil-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different viscoelastic properties quantified in-situ using a rheometer. An additional test is made with a floating PVC film to estimate possible attenuation in the boundary layer under the cover. Within the frequency range tested, the wavelength deviates from open water case negligibly under the PVC film. But for the PDMS covers, depending on the material property, cover thickness and incident wave period, both wave lengthening and shortening are observed. With thin PDMS covers, the measured wavelength matches well with three theoretical predictions based on different viscoelastic rheological models, while the thick cover shows some discrepancy especially for shorter wave periods. In terms of wave attenuation, however, large discrepancies are observed between the measured data and theoretically predicted results for all PDMS covers. Various mechanisms that could contribute to the discrepancies are considered. The most important mechanism is the boundary layer effect, as demonstrated by the measured wave attenuation from the PVC film. The overall results indicate that the attenuation due to the oscillatory boundary layer underneath the floating cover, which has not been included in the viscoelastic theories, contributes significantly to the discrepancies. Direct measurement of the fluid flow under a periodically flexing cover and the related attenuation rate is a challenging but highly important future study.
Surface acoustic wave-based gas sensors
 A brief review of the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)-based gas sensors and their physical operation background in a dual-delay line oscillator system is presented together with some own achievements dealing with SAW layered sensor structures.
Flow transition and hydrothermal wave instability of thermocapillary-driven flow in a free rectangular liquid film
 Thermocapillary-driven flow in a free liquid film, which has two gas-liquid interfaces, is experimentally investigated. Silicone oil of 5 cSt is employed as the test fluid. Two-dimensional basic flow known as ‘double-layered flow’ after Ueno and Torii (2010) is realized under small-enough Marangoni number Ma, the non-dimensional number to describe the intensity of thermocapillary effect, under the geometry considered in the present study. The flow exhibits a transition from the two-dimensional steady flow state to the three-dimensional oscillatory state when the intensity of the imposed thermocapillary effect along the free surfaces exceeds the threshold. In this oscillatory regime, two types of hydrothermal wave instabilities are observed: the traveling-wave flow and the standing-wave flow. We especially focus on the traveling-wave instability and compare it with a hydrothermal wave in a liquid layer with a single free surface investigated by other researchers.
High frequency surface acoustic wave resonator-based sensor for particulate matter detection
 This paper describes the characterization of high frequency Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator based (SAWR) sensors, for the detection of micron and sub-micron sized particles. The sensor comprises two 262 MHz ST-cut quartz based Rayleigh wave SAWRs where one is used for particle detection and the other as reference. Electro-acoustic detection of different sized particles shows a strong relationship between mass sensitivity (Δf/Δm) and particle diameter (Dp). This enables frequency-dependent SAWR sensitivity to be tailored to the size of particles, thus making these types of sensors good candidates for PM10, PM2.5 and ultrafine particle (UFP) sensing. Our initial characterisation demonstrated a typical SAWR frequency shift of 60 Hz in response to a deposition of ca. 0.21 ng of 0.75 μm-sized gold particles (∼50 particles) on the sensor surface. Sensor responses to different sized particles, such as ∼30 μm diameter silicon, gold (diameters of ∼0.75 μm and ∼20 μm), ∼8 μm fine sugar, PTFE (∼1 μm and ∼15 μm), ∼4 μm talcum powder, and ∼2 μm molybdenum powder were evaluated, and an average mass sensitivity of 275 Hz/ng was obtained. Based on the results obtained in this study we believe that acoustic wave technology has great potential for application in airborne particle detection. Moreover, acoustic resonator devices can be integrated with CMOS interface circuitry to obtain sensitive, robust, low-power and low-cost particle detectors for a variety of applications including outdoor environmental monitoring.
A surface-acoustic-wave-based cantilever bio-sensor
 A scalable surface-acoustic-wave- (SAW-) based cantilevered device for portable bio-chemical sensing applications is presented. Even in the current, proof-of-principle implementation this architecture is shown to outperform commercial quartz–crystal microbalances in terms of sensitivity. Adhesion of analytes on a functionalized surface of the cantilever shifts the resonant frequency of a SAW-generating transducer due to the stress-induced variation of the speed of surface acoustic modes. We discuss the relevance of this approach for diagnostics applications based on miniaturized devices.
Interaction of ultrasonic waves with partially-closed cracks in concrete structures
 Interaction of ultrasonic waves with partially-closed surface-breaking cracks in concrete structures has been studied. Measurements have been conducted on a reinforced concrete beam containing various mechanical-load-induced cracks and compared with the baseline measurements at those locations. Influence of crack width, incident angle of waves with cracks, and distance from the cracks on travel time and amplitude of the waves have been investigated when the beam was unloaded. It has been observed that a measurable part of the waves propagate through the cracks due to the acoustic coupling between the crack faces, although attenuation can be relatively high. The travel time has shown a nearly independent behavior from remaining crack opening in the measured range of 0.05 mm to 3 mm. Measurements in directions orthogonal and parallel to the crack suggest that there is substantial anisotropy in the cracking zone. Furthermore, an effective width of the micro-cracking area around the cracks has been estimated from the measurements.
Intracochlear pressure measurements during acoustic shock wave exposure
 Injuries to the peripheral auditory system are among the most common results of high intensity impulsive acoustic exposure. Prior studies of high intensity sound transmission by the ossicular chain have relied upon measurements in animal models, measurements at more moderate sound levels (i.e. < 130 dB SPL), and/or measured responses to steady-state noise. Here, we directly measure intracochlear pressure in human cadaveric temporal bones, with fiber optic pressure sensors placed in scala vestibuli (SV) and tympani (ST), during exposure to shock waves with peak positive pressures between ∼7 and 83 kPa. Eight full-cephalic human cadaver heads were exposed, face-on, to acoustic shock waves in a 45 cm diameter shock tube. Specimens were exposed to impulses with nominal peak overpressures of 7, 28, 55, & 83 kPa (171, 183, 189, & 192 dB pSPL), measured in the free field adjacent to the forehead. Specimens were prepared bilaterally by mastoidectomy and extended facial recess to expose the ossicular chain. Ear canal (EAC), middle ear, and intracochlear sound pressure levels were measured with fiber-optic pressure sensors. Surface-mounted sensors measured SPL and skull strain near the opening of each EAC and at the forehead. Measurements on the forehead showed incident peak pressures approximately twice that measured by adjacent free-field and EAC entrance sensors, as expected based on the sensor orientation (normal vs tangential to the shock wave propagation). At 7 kPa, EAC pressure showed gain, calculated from the frequency spectra, consistent with the ear canal resonance, and gain in the intracochlear pressures (normalized to the EAC pressure) were consistent with (though somewhat lower than) previously reported middle ear transfer functions. Responses to higher intensity impulses tended to show lower intracochlear gain relative to EAC, suggesting sound transmission efficiency along the ossicular chain is reduced at high intensities. Tympanic membrane (TM) rupture was observed following nearly every exposure 55 kPa or higher. Intracochlear pressures reveal lower middle-ear transfer function magnitudes (i.e. reduced gain relative to the ear canal) for high sound pressure levels, thus revealing lower than expected cochlear exposure based on extrapolation from cochlear pressures measured at more moderate sound levels. These results are consistent with lowered transmissivity of the ossicular chain at high intensities, and are consistent with our prior report measuring middle ear transfer functions in human cadaveric temporal bones with high intensity tone pips.
ZnO/ST-Quartz SAW resonator: An efficient NO2 gas sensor
 A Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator operating at a frequency of 99.50 MHz using piezoelectric ST-cut quartz has been fabricated. The resonator device has been successfully integrated with ZnO sensing layer for detection of NO2 gas. The fabricated sensor device is found to be detecting trace level concentration of NO2 gas (400 ppb to 16 ppm) efficiently and selectively. The ZnO/Quartz SAW sensor is useful for wireless detection of NO2 gas.
On the use of linear theory to estimate bottom pressure distribution under nonlinear surface waves
 The bottom pressure distribution beneath large amplitude waves is studied within linear theory in time and space domain, weakly dispersive Serre–Green–Naghdi system and fully nonlinear potential equations. These approaches are used to compare pressure fields induced by solitary waves, but also by transient wave groups. It is shown that linear analysis in time domain is in good agreement with Serre–Green–Naghdi predictions for solitary waves with highest amplitude A=0.7h, h being water depth. In the meantime, when comparing results to fully nonlinear potential equations, neither linear theory in time domain, nor in space domain, provide a good description of the pressure peak. The linear theory in time domain underestimates the peak by an amount similar to the overestimation by linear theory in space domain. For transient wave groups (up to A=0.52h), linear analysis in time domain provides results very similar to those based on the Serre–Green–Naghdi system. In the meantime, linear theory in space domain provides a surprisingly good comparison with prediction of fully nonlinear theory. In all cases, it has to be emphasized that a discrepancy between linear theory in space domain and in time domain was always found, and presented an averaged value of 20%. Since linear theory is often used by coastal engineers to reconstruct water elevation from bottom mounted sensors, the so-called inverse problem, an important result of this work is that special caution should be given when doing so. The method might surprisingly work with strongly nonlinear waves, but is highly sensitive to the imbalance between nonlinearity and dispersion. In most cases, linear theory, in both time and space domain, will lead to important errors when solving this inverse problem.
Observation of surf zone wave transformation using LiDAR
 The use of LiDAR as an alternative to an array of in-situ instruments for water elevation measurement, specifically in the surf zone, is covered in detail. This paper outlines the advances in remote sensing of the coastal environment and provide both laboratory and field observations obtained through the application of LIDAR scanning devices. The results of this paper show a good correlation between LiDAR and pressure transducer measurements of water elevation in both a wave flume and within the surf zone (mean coefficient of determination of 0.76 and 0.89 respectively). The water surface reflectivity of the study area needs to be maximised in order for the LiDAR to provide suitable measurements, therefore a method of seeding in the wave flume is described. Points to consider for the setup of the LiDAR instrument in both the laboratory and the field are discussed, as well as the influence that wave parameters such as wave height and wave period have on the quality of results. Free surface elevation data across the spatial and temporal domain can be obtained with LiDAR and used for a wide range of wave analyses.
Storm waves focusing and steepening in the Agulhas current: Satellite observations and modeling
 Strong ocean currents can modify the height and shape of ocean waves, possibly causing extreme sea states in particular conditions. The risk of extreme waves is a known hazard in the shipping routes crossing some of the main current systems. Modeling surface current interactions in standard wave numerical models is an active area of research that benefits from the increased availability and accuracy of satellite observations. We report a typical case of a swell system propagating in the Agulhas current, using wind and sea state measurements from several satellites, jointly with state of the art analytical and numerical modeling of wave-current interactions. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar and altimeter measurements are used to show the evolution of the swell train and resulting local extreme waves. A ray tracing analysis shows that the significant wave height variability at scales <~100 km is well associated with the current vorticity patterns. Predictions of the WAVEWATCH III numerical model in a version that accounts for wave-current interactions are consistent with observations, although their effects are still under-predicted in the present configuration. From altimeter measurements, very large significant wave height gradients are shown to be well captured, and also associated with the current vorticity patterns at global scale.
A method to recover water-wave profiles from pressure measurements
 An operational formulation is proposed for reconstructing a time series of water surface displacement from waves using measurements of pressure. The approach is based on the fully nonlinear formulation for pressure below traveling-wave solutions of Euler’s equations developed by Oliveras, Vasan, Deconinck and Henderson. Its validity is tested using experiments in which both the pressure and the surface displacement are measured. The experiments include a wave system that is Galilean invariant – cnoidal waves, and wave systems that are not – reflected cnoidal waves and wave groups. We find that since the proposed formulation is nonlinear, it reproduces the amplitude spectrum of the measured surface displacements better than the hydrostatic model and better than the linear model that takes into account the pressure response factor due to small amplitude waves (the transfer function). Both the proposed formula and the transfer function reconstruct the surface reasonably well, with the proposed formula’s being about 5% more accurate.
A modal sensor integrated circular cylindrical wedge wave ultrasonic motor
 This study investigates a new circular cylindrical wedge wave ultrasonic motor (WW-USM) integrated with modal sensors. The presented motor is driven by continuous wedge waves of the fundamental modes with an integer circumferential number. In this design, the constructive interference of two equal-intensity standing waves actuated by two comb transducers generates a traveling wedge wave. Dual-phase electrodes were parallel to the axis placed on a piezoelectric (PZT) tube at a distance of 1/4 wavelength. Two orthogonal sinusoidal signals at the resonant frequency of designated flexural mode exerting on the electrodes have the WW-USM operate in bidirectional rotation. The base height of the stator was appropriately tuned to achieve an excellent modal separation from other vibration modes. A modal sensor on the border of the PZT tube was designed to detect the dynamic characteristics of the WW-USM and to improve the performance. The wedge wave motor has a flexible mechanical performance between the angular speed and output torque. Varying the contact position of the rotor on the inclined surface of the stator may exchange the angular speed for torque output. No further modification of the entire motor structure is needed. The prototype WW-USM driven by the flexural mode F(1, 4) under 1 N static preload was operated by an AC voltage of 400 Vpp at the frequency of 36.605 kHz. The maximum values of angular speed, output torque, and electromechanical transduction efficiency are 225 rpm, 15.736 mN m, and 16.22%, respectively.
Experimental study of a thermoacoustically-driven traveling wave thermoacoustic refrigerator
 New configurations of traveling wave thermoacoustic refrigerators driven by a traveling wave thermoacoustic engine were introduced and tested in this paper. First, the performance of the refrigerator with different-diameter inertance tubes was investigated experimentally. Then, investigation of substituting a flexible membrane attached to inertial mass for inertance tube was tested. The experimental results show that the substitution could improve the efficiency of the system and lead to a larger cooling power. So far, using helium gas as the working gas, the system could provide 340 W cooling power at the temperature of −20 °C with working frequency of 57 Hz and average pressure of 3.0 MPa. The total COP, i.e., cooling power divided by heating power, is 0.16.
Experimental study of quasi-periodic on-off phenomena in a small-scale traveling wave thermoacoustic heat engine
 Periodic and spontaneous on-off oscillation belongs to the onset and damping behaviors of thermoacoustic engines, and investigations on this phenomenon lead to better operation of the thermoacoustic engines with stable performances. In this paper, the quasi- periodic on-off oscillation in a small-scale traveling wave thermoacoustic heat engine with a resonator length of only 1 m was experimentally investigated. The type of working media, mean pressure and the input heating power are the main operating parameters, which significantly affect the formation of the periodic on-off oscillation. The experimental results demonstrated there was a critical charge pressure over which the periodic on-off oscillation could happen. For the small- scale engine with helium gas as the working media, the mean pressure threshold value was about 1.4 MPa and the on-off oscillation occurred with a single frequency. Using nitrogen and argon gas as the working media, the on-off oscillation was not observed. The reason was qualitatively analyzed as well.
Canalization without flux sensors: a traveling-wave hypothesis
 In 1969, Tsvi Sachs published his seminal hypothesis of vascular development in plants: the canalization hypothesis. A positive feedback loop between the flux of the phytohormone auxin and the cells’ auxin transport capacity would canalize auxin progressively into discrete channels, which would then differentiate into vascular tissues. Recent experimental studies confirm the central role of polar auxin flux in plant vasculogenesis, but it is unclear if and by which mechanism plant cells could respond to auxin flux. In this Opinion article, we review auxin perception mechanisms and argue that these respond more likely to auxin concentrations than to auxin flux. We propose an alternative mechanism for polar auxin channeling, which is more consistent with recent molecular observations.
High-speed imaging of wave modes in an RDC
 Various operating modes have been observed in the rotating detonation combustor (RDC) studied here, as well as by others. These modes can be generally categorized into two groups: one or more co-rotating waves and counter-rotating waves. The combustor is able to stabilize both types of operation, however the stabilization mechanism remains unclear. In order to better understand these cases, these operational modes are investigated with high-speed pressure transducers installed in the combustor annulus combined with simultaneous high-speed video imaging of the natural luminosity of the detonation wave from the aft end of the RDC. These results confirm the operation in both the steady single wave mode as well as the counter-rotating waves mode. The presence of this mode further demonstrates the complex dynamics inherent in the stabilization of the detonation wave. As each wave propagates, they initially begin to weaken followed by re-strengthening after collision which serves to stabilize the mode. Differences in the velocities of the waves was also observed to result in a beating phenomenon expressed as an amplitude modulation of the pressure traces. High-speed video imaging of the high-temperature emission from H2O in the RDC annulus was used in conjunction with the pressure traces for a range of flow rates and equivalence ratios. Processing of the images into the wave frame of reference allowed for the identification of the average luminosity profile, characterized by a steep increase in natural luminosity near the wave front, followed by a trailing tail extending approximately half the annulus perimeter.
Model updating of periodic structures based on free wave characteristics
 Many civil engineering structures have a repetitive or quasi-periodic geometry. Such structures have clustered modes with closely spaced natural frequencies corresponding to mode shapes with similar wavelengths. Such modes may be difficult to distinguish in modal tests and lead to difficulties when pairing calculated and experimentally determined modal characteristics in vibration-based model updating. For repetitive structures, the free wave characteristics, i.e. propagation constants and free waves, can be used alternatively to characterize their dynamic behaviour. The free wave characteristics can therefore be used instead of modal characteristics as data features in model updating of repetitive structures. This paper investigates the feasibility of model updating of repetitive structures based on free wave characteristics. First, the identification of the free wave characteristics from the measured vibration responses of a periodic structure is investigated. A stabilization diagram is constructed to pick up the stable free waves. Second, model updating of repetitive structures is performed through a match of the calculated and experimentally identified free wave characteristics. A least-squares cost function is formulated and minimized using a gradient-based optimization algorithm. This algorithm requires the sensitivity of the free wave characteristics to the model parameters that need to be updated. The analytical expressions for the free wave sensitivities are therefore derived. The proposed model updating procedure is demonstrated and validated by a numerical case study involving a repetitive frame structure and by an experiment on a four-storey steel frame structure. The results confirm the feasibility of model updating based on free wave characteristics for repetitive structures.
Selected optoelectronic sensors in medical applications
 Optoelectronic technology plays an important role in medical diagnosis. In the paper a review of some optoelectronic sensors for invasive and non-invasive human health test is presented. The main attention is paid on their basic operation principle and medical usefulness. The paper presents also own research related to developing of tools for human breath analysis. Breath sample unit and three gaseous biomarkers analyzer employing laser absorption spectroscopy designed for clinical diagnostics were described. The analyzer is equipped with sensors for CO, CH4 and NO detection. The sensors operate using multi-pass spectroscopy with wavelength modulation method (MUPASS-WMS) and cavity enhanced spectroscopy (CEAS).
Hydrodynamic modeling of cochlea and numerical simulation for cochlear traveling wave with consideration of fluid-structure interaction
 The cochlea is an important structure in the hearing system of humanity. Its unique structure enables the sensibility to the sound waves of varied frequencies. The widely accepted model of the cochlea is expressed as a long tube longitudinally divided by a membrane named the Basilar Membrane (BM), into two fluid-filled channels. Based on various assumptions for the cochlear fluid and structure, simplified mathematical and mechanical cochlear models were developed to help to understand the mechanism of the complex coupled system in the past decades. This paper proposes a hydrodynamic numerical cochlear model with consideration of the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI). In this model, the cochlear lymph is considered as in a Newtonian viscous fluid, and the basilar membrane is modeled as a composite structure. The traveling wave is simulated. Also focusing on the pressure in the fluid field, the results are compared with studies of Peterson and Bogert, where it was assumed that the slow compressive waves are traveling along the BM. Furthermore, the transmitting time of the cochlear traveling wave is also discussed.
Travelling wave and non-stationary response in nonlinear vibrations of water-filled circular cylindrical shells: Experiments and simulations
 The nonlinear vibrations of a water-filled circular cylindrical shell subjected to radial harmonic excitation in the spectral neighbourhood of the lowest resonances are investigated experimentally and numerically by using a seamless aluminium sample. The experimental boundary conditions are close to simply supported edges. The presence of exact one-to-one internal resonance, giving rise to a travelling wave response around the shell circumference and non-stationary vibrations, is experimentally observed and the nonlinear response is numerically reproduced. The travelling wave is measured by means of state-of-the-art laser Doppler vibrometers applied to multiple points on the structure simultaneously. Chaos is detected in the frequency region where the travelling wave response is present. The reduced-order model is based on the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory retaining in-plane inertia and the nonlinear equations of motion are numerically studied (i) by using a code based on arclength continuation method that allows bifurcation analysis in case of stationary vibrations, (ii) by a continuation code based on direct integration and Poincaré maps that evaluates also the maximum Lyapunov exponent in case of non-stationary vibrations. The comparison of experimental and numerical results is particularly satisfactory.
Recent development in nanocarbon materials for gas sensor applications
 Gas sensors have been widely used to monitor leakages and control the concentrations of various gases, during the production and fabrication processes of industrials. Conventional gas sensors were based on semiconducting oxides, such as SnO2, ZnO, Fe2O3 and In2O3. Recent development revealed that nanocarbons, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanosheets of graphene nanosheets, carbon nanofibers and carbon black, exhibit strong high performance gas sensing behaviors. Furthermore, gas sensing performances the nanocarbon materials can be enhanced by forming hybrids with nanoparticles of noble metals and semiconducting oxides. This review paper was aimed to provide an overview on recent progress in the development and characterization of gas sensors based these nanocarbon materials and their hybrids.
Detection of 3-D objects with a 2-D laser scanning sensor for greenhouse spray applications
 Precise measurement of plant dimensions can provide essential information for variable-rate spray application technologies to discharge the amounts of chemicals actually needed by the plants. The accuracy of a 270° radial laser scanning sensor combined with a specially-designed plant surface mapping algorithm was evaluated in detection of complex-shaped object surfaces and sizes. Data acquisition and three-dimensional (3-D) image construction were supported with the specially-designed algorithm. The objects in the test were toy balls with a pink smooth surface, light brown rectangular cardboard boxes, black and red texture surfaced basketballs, white smooth cylinders, and two different sized artificial plants. Test variables included four different detection heights (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 m) above each object, five sensor travel speeds (1.6, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0 and 4.8 km h−1), and 8–15 horizontal distances to the sensor ranging from 0 to 3.5 m. Horizontal distances of the objects to the laser sensor influenced the accuracy significantly, and the influence became weaker when the objects were closer to each other. The color and finish of object surfaces did not apparently affect the sensor detection accuracy. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation (CV) in the laser sensor travel direction and object height direction varied slightly with detection heights, travel speeds, and object positions. The highest RMSE and CV were 83 mm and 50.9% in the horizontal direction, 41 mm and 15.2% in the travel direction, and 16 mm and 14.0% in the height direction, respectively. These tests demonstrated the potential adaptation of the laser scanning sensor and the specially-designed algorithm to measure complex-shaped targets for future development of automatic spray systems to achieve variable-rate functions in greenhouse applications.
An acoustically matched traveling-wave thermoacoustic generator achieving 750 W electric power
 TWTEG (traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator) is promising in efficiently converting the heat of fuel combustion, solar energy, industrial waste heat, etc. into electricity with a very scalable power output. Based on the decoupling method and theoretical analysis, the acoustic impedance requirements of the TWTE (traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine) and LAs (linear alternators) to reach an efficient and powerful operation state were studied quantitatively. A 1 kW level traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator was then built for experimental study. Good matching conditions of acoustic impedances were then experimentally demonstrated by modulating the working frequency, load resistance, and electric reactance of the thermoacoustic electric generator, which agreed well with the theoretical analysis. A maximum electric power output of 750.4 W and a highest thermal-to-electric efficiency of 0.163 have been achieved by the acoustically matched thermoacoustic electric generator with helium of 3.16 MPa as the working gas. This work would be instructive for the acoustic matching and designs of high-performance thermoacoustic electric generation systems.
Alongshore variability in wave energy transfer to coastal cliffs
 The alongshore distribution of wave energy is believed to be an important control on the spatial variability of coastal erosion. There is, however, a lack of field data quantifying the alongshore variability in wave energy on rock coasts, whereby the relative control of coastline geometry versus foreshore characteristics on wave energy delivery remains unclear. A number of studies have identified high-frequency cliff-top ground shaking to be generated by wave impacts at the cliff toe during high tides (HT). To capture the variability of wave-cliff impact energy along-coast, we installed an array of cliff-top seismometers along a 1 km stretch of coastline in North Yorkshire, UK. Our aim is to constrain how wave energy transfer to the cliff toe varies, and to examine the relative energy transfer around typical coastline features, including a bay and headlands. Whilst the greatest HT ground motion energy is recorded at a headland and the lowest at the centre of the bay (5% of that observed at the headland), we identify no systematic alongshore variation in the HT ground motion energy that can be related to coastline morphology. We also note considerable variation between features of similar form: the total HT ground motion energy at one headland is only 49% of the next headland 1 km alongshore. Between neighbouring sites within the bay, separated by only 100 m, we observe up to an order of magnitude difference in ground motion energy transfer. Our results demonstrate the importance of the foreshore in driving the variations in energy delivery that we observe. Local alterations in water depth and foreshore topography control the alongshore distribution of wave energy available to generate cliff HT ground motions. Importantly, this apparently local effect overrides the influence of macroscale coastal planform morphology, which has previously been assumed to be the dominant control. The results show that foreshore characteristics that hold influence over wave energy transfer vary significantly over short (~100 m) distances, and so we expect erosion controlled by wave impacts to vary over similar scales.
Millimeter-wave antenna of a travelling-wave long sinusoidal slot in the broad face of a rectangular waveguide
 A travelling-wave long sinusoidal slot in the broad face of a millimeter-wave (Ka-Band) rectangular waveguide is investigated. Similarities and differences with a same-shaped slot, but in the narrow face of the waveguide, which was investigated in a former study [1], are also discussed. It is observed that the most important difference between two antenna structures is the applied analytical model. It is found in measurements that the antenna with a broad face can only be described by an electric current model unlike the antenna with a narrow face where the magnetic current model agrees with measurements. In experimental study, some antenna parameters of the structure are demonstrated. The sinusoidal slot antenna investigated in this study has also a cross-polarized beam like the one in the narrow face of rectangular waveguide and a similar metallic grid polarizer is used like in the previous study to suppress this cross polarized beam. A suppression level up to 12 dB is reached. Antenna efficiency is calculated using S-parameters measurement and a remarkable increment is obtained after the polarizer is applied.
Traveling waves and trial averaging: The nature of single-trial and averaged brain responses in large-scale cortical signals
 Analyzing single trial brain activity remains a challenging problem in the neurosciences. We gain purchase on this problem by focusing on globally synchronous fields in within-trial evoked brain activity, rather than on localized peaks in the trial-averaged evoked response (ER). We analyzed data from three measurement modalities, each with different spatial resolutions: magnetoencephalogram (MEG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG). We first characterized the ER in terms of summation of phase and amplitude components over trials. Both contributed to the ER, as expected, but the ER topography was dominated by the phase component. This means the observed topography of cross-trial phase will not necessarily reflect the phase topography within trials. To assess the organization of within-trial phase, traveling wave (TW) components were quantified by computing the phase gradient. TWs were intermittent but ubiquitous in the within-trial evoked brain activity. At most task-relevant times and frequencies, the within-trial phase topography was described better by a TW than by the trial-average of phase. The trial-average of the TW components also reproduced the topography of the ER; we suggest that the ER topography arises, in large part, as an average over TW behaviors. These findings were consistent across the three measurement modalities. We conclude that, while phase is critical to understanding the topography of event-related activity, the preliminary step of collating cortical signals across trials can obscure the TW components in brain activity and lead to an underestimation of the coherent motion of cortical fields.
Experimental Study on a 500 W Traveling-wave Thermoacoustic Electric Generator
 Traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator is promising in solar power generation and energy recovering due to its high efficiency, high reliability, and capability of utilizing low-grade heat. A traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator composed of a thermoacoustic engine and two linear alternators is designed and constructed. Output electric power and thermal-to-electric efficiency of the system are studied under different working conditions. Experimental results show that the load resistance should be optimized to achieve a good performance. A maximum electric power of 473.6 W and a maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 14.5% are achieved by optimizing the load resistances, respectively. Further improvements are expected by increasing the working pressure and optimizing the acoustic coupling between the linear alternators and the thermoacoustic engine.
A cubic spline layerwise time domain spectral FE for guided wave simulation in laminated composite plate structures with physically modeled active piezoelectric sensors
 A novel theoretical framework is presented enabling enhanced simulation of guided waves generated by piezoelectric actuators in laminated composite plates. A new multi-field multi-physics layerwise theory is formulated for laminated plates with piezoelectric actuators and sensors which captures symmetric and anti-symmetric stress waves. Third-order Hermite splines are employed in the approximation of displacements and electric potential through the thickness. The piezoelectric actuators and sensors are physically modeled though coupled electromechanical governing equations. An explicit time-domain spectral finite element is formulated entailing displacement and electric degrees of freedom at the nodes which are further collocated with Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre integration points. The stiffness, consistent semi-diagonal mass, piezoelectric and electric permittivity matrices are calculated. Furthermore, an explicit time integration scheme is presented for the calculation of the coupled transient electromechanical response including the free sensor response. Numerical guided wave predictions of the developed multi-node time domain spectral finite elements are correlated with well established numerical tools and with experiments conducted on laminated carbon/epoxy plates with active piezoceramic sensor networks. Important effects introduced by the physical presence of the active actuator/sensor system on guided wave propagation, such as wave reflections, mode conversions and sensor signal attenuation, are successfully captured by the developed finite element and correlated and evaluated with numerical and experimental results.
Sparse representation for Lamb-wave-based damage detection using a dictionary algorithm
 Lamb waves are being investigated extensively for structural health monitoring (SHM) because of their characteristics of traveling long distances with little attenuation and sensitivity to minor local damage in structures. However, Lamb waves are dispersive, which results in the complex overlap of waveforms in the damage detection applications of the SHM community. This paper proposes a sparse representation strategy based on an l1-norm optimization algorithm for guided-Lamb-wave-based inspections. A comprehensive dictionary is designed containing various waveforms under diverse conditions so that the received waveform can be decomposed into a spatial domain for the identification of damage location. Furthermore, the l1-norm optimization algorithm is employed to pursue the sparse solution related to the physical damage location. The functionality of the created dictionary is validated by both metal beam and composite wind turbine experiments. The results indicate a great potential for the proposed sparse representation using a dictionary algorithm, which provides an effective alternative approach for damage detection.
Ultrasonic tactile sensor integrated with TFT array for force feedback and shape recognition
 In this study, we propose an ultrasonic tactile sensor for real time contact force measurements and high-resolution shape recognition to enable safe and reliable robotic grasping of objects that may vary in compliance or texture. The sensing mechanism utilizes piezoelectric transduction where pulsed alternating voltage signals are applied to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thin film, which generates pulses of ultrasound waves that travel upwards through the sensor components to the object contact interface. These waves are reflected back onto a receiver PVDF thin film that produces a localized voltage output, which is detected by the TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) array layer and converted into a two-dimensional grayscale image after signal processing. The ability of the tactile sensor to detect contact forces can be attributed to the sensor surface having a thin compliant polymer layer with a microstructure array. When the sensor contacts objects, the microstructures act as force concentrators, resulting in the localized deformation of the polymer layer that can be observed by the proposed ultrasonic imaging technique with an observed linear response to normal static forces in the range of 1–6 N. Furthermore, the shape sensing resolution and force detection range of the tactile sensor can be tuned by varying the number of microstructures in the array and the utilization of polymers with varying hardness, respectively.
Traveling waves in response to a diffusing quorum sensing signal in spatially-extended bacterial colonies
 In the behavior known as quorum sensing (QS), bacteria release diffusible signal molecules known as autoinducers, which by accumulating in the environment induce population-wide changes in gene expression. Although QS has been extensively studied in well-mixed systems, the ability of diffusing QS signals to synchronize gene expression in spatially extended colonies is not well understood. Here we investigate the one-dimensional spatial propagation of QS-circuit activation in a simple, analytically tractable reaction-diffusion model for the LuxR–LuxI circuit, which regulates bioluminescence of the marine bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri. The quorum activation loop is modeled by a Hill function with a cooperativity exponent (m=2.2). The model is parameterized from laboratory data and captures the major empirical properties of the LuxR–LuxI system and its QS regulation of A. fischeri bioluminescence. Our simulations of the model show propagating waves of activation or deactivation of the QS circuit in a spatially extended colony. We further prove analytically that the model equations possess a traveling wave solution. This mathematical proof yields the rate of autoinducer degradation that is compatible with a traveling wave of gene expression as well as the critical degradation rate at which the nature of the wave switches from activation to deactivation. Our results can be used to predict the direction and activating or deactivating nature of a wave of gene expression in experimentally controlled bacterial populations subject to a diffusing autoinducer signal.
Water-wave profiles from pressure measurements: Extensions
 In this letter, we present a method to reconstruct the surface elevation of an inviscid traveling gravity wave in two dimensions using the pressure measured at any depth. In order to achieve this reconstruction, we derive a map from the pressure at an arbitrary depth p(x,z0) to the horizontal velocity at the bottom of the fluid domain. Once this map is established, we use the result presented in Oliveras et al. (2012) to find the free-surface η. In addition to the fully nonlinear relationship, we present a “heuristic” asymptotic formula that does not involve the wave speed c.
Measurement of speed of sound, density compressibility and viscosity in liquid methyl laurate and ethyl laurate up to 200 MPa by using acoustic wave sensors
 This paper presents measurements of speed of sound, density, viscosity and compressibility in liquid ethyl laurate and methyl laurate along isotherms ranging from (293.15 to 353.15) K at pressures that cover the pressure range of common rail direct fuel injection systems (up to 200 MPa). Measurements have been carried out by two different acoustic wave sensors assembled within a single device. The former works in the longitudinal mode to determine speed of sound whereas the latter acts in the thickness shear mode in order to measure the density viscosity product. The measurement principle of sound speed is based on pulse-echo technique whereas density is evaluated by integration of speed of sound measurement using Newton Laplace equation. Viscosity is determined from measurement of the resonance behavior of the thickness shear wave sensor. Finally both isothermal and isentropic compressibilities are obtained from density and speed of sound data.
An analytical model of final average droplet size prediction of wave spray cloud
 This study introduces an analytical model to predict the final average droplet size within a spray cloud that is formed due to wave interactions with marine objects. The process of spray cloud formation from wave impact involves several complicated processes, and each of these phenomena should be taken into account when considering an analytical approach. Following this process-based approach, the model first considers the wave characteristics and relates wave properties to the maximum impact pressure also considering the effect of air entrapment occurrence. Secondly, the maximum impact pressure is correlated empirically to the maximum wave run-up velocity. Finally, wave run-up velocity is linked with water sheet breakup models, which leads to the prediction of the final average diameter of ligaments and droplets. The prediction model is compared with experimental measurements from experiments conducted in a tow tank to form a spray cloud due to wave impact with two lab-scale models. Several measuring techniques such as image processing, bubble image velocimetry (BIV), and digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) methods were implemented to measure the physical quantity of each phenomenon during the event of wave interaction. The effects of initial wave characteristics, the geometrical parameters of the impact condition and water sheet thickness at the moment of impact, on the final average droplet diameter were investigated. A sensitivity analysis of most of the principal parameters was performed to show the high veracity of the prediction model.
Monitoring the hardening process of ultra high performance concrete using decomposed modes of guided waves
 In this study, the hardening process of ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) was monitored non-destructively using a single embedded sensor system and the characteristics of guided waves, especially the Lamb wave. Lamb wave propagation depends on the material properties of the medium and boundary conditions. Since the boundary conditions of the embedded sensor system continuously change during the hardening process of concrete materials, the measured characteristics of the propagating waves also vary. To understand the variations in wave propagation, the Lamb modes were decomposed using the polarization characteristics of piezoelectric sensors, which were used to measure wave responses. Additionally, a traditional penetration resistance method was adopted to estimate the time for phase transition of UHPC. The decomposed Lamb modes were compared to measurements of penetration resistance. The strength development of UHPC, with and without short-fiber reinforcement, was estimated using the variation of patterns of the decomposed Lamb modes after the phase transition. Based on the proposed methodology, which measures the propagation and variation of the Lamb waves, it is possible to estimate the time of phase transition and the strength development of UHPC.
Mechanical Transducers
 Mechanical sensors form a class of sensors that are sensitive to changes in mechanical properties; popular mechanical sensors such as cantilevers and acoustic sensors play an important role in molecular detection. We describe mechanical cantilever-based molecular sensors and discuss analytical characterization of a simple cantilever. Next, we discuss designs, implementation, and applications of cantilever-based molecular sensors. Micromachined cantilevers are fabricated using photolithography techniques. The two main methods of molecular detection are discussed: the deflection-based method and the resonance frequency-based method, Then, techniques for readout are introduced: laser reflection, interferometry, piezoresistive, and capacitive methods. Applications of cantilever sensors for molecular sensing are introduced and are followed by discussions on the limitations of cantilever sensors and techniques needed to progress microcantilever technology past the current state. Recent advances in the development of nanomaterial-based resonators are described. We describe acoustic wave based biosensors; these are sensors that utilize acoustic waves to derive information about their environment. The acoustic waveform can be altered by environmental properties, which translates into a measurable electrical signal. The electrical transduction is based on the piezoelectric effect, a phenomenon by which a material produces a charge in response to an applied force and vice versa. We also describe mechanical resonators based on quartz tuning forks, the working principle of which also relies on the piezoelectric effect. Finally, we introduce several types of thermal sensors related to molecular sensing or biomedical applications. Thermal sensing measures the activities of molecules in chemical or biological systems, based on mechanical transduction and combinations of electrical and optical techniques.
Relaminarization of turbulent channel flow using traveling wave-like wall deformation
 Effect of traveling wave-like wall deformation (i.e. peristalsis) in a fully developed turbulent channel flow is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. We not only demonstrate that the friction drag is reduced by wave-like wall deformation traveling toward the downstream direction, but also show that the turbulence is completely suppressed (viz. the flow is relaminarized) under some sets of parameters. It is also found that at higher amplitude of actuation the relaminarized flow is unstable and exhibits a periodic cycle between high and low drag. The drag reduction is caused by suppression of random Reynolds shear stress component due to stabilization. The quadrant analysis reveals that traveling wave-like wall deformation makes strongly negative random Reynolds shear stress in the converging region.
The propagation of horizontally polarized shear waves in plates bordered with viscous liquid
 Requirements for ultrasonic horizontally polarized shear waves based viscosity sensors and their applicability for continuous in-line measurement are presented and discussed. The results reveal, that sensors using non-piezoelectric plates as well as wave guides and sensing surface have application-oriented advantages in corrosive and hot liquids. For such non-piezoelectric plate sensors, the dispersion relations are found and the linking equation among propagation velocity as well as attenuation coefficient and Newtonian liquid parameters are obtained. The findings show that in presence of viscous liquids the propagation parameters of horizontally polarized shear waves (HPSW) in non-piezoelectric plate change and a viscosity depending attenuation occurs. It is shown that the measurement sensitivity, in physical terms, of the investigated device highly depends on plate thickness, shear wave impedance of the plate material, and the shear wave impedance of the ambient liquid. Further, reasonable geometrical optimizations and suited plate materials are discussed.

Sensor fusion, sensitivity analysis and calibration in shooter localization systems
 This paper analyses the principles and the underlying mathematical model for acoustic based shooter detection systems. These systems use the muzzle blast and acoustic shock waves to compute the shooter's location. Our detection system works on a distributed sensor network where microphone arrays are used as sensors. Detection algorithms run concurrently at each node. After determining the wave directions, the information is passed to the central node. The central node fuses data coming from each sensor with our optimization algorithm. For correct georeferenced fusion, GPS, accelerometer and magnetometer data are used. A mathematical framework of the problem with possible node outputs has been developed in this study. Our framework supports all possible combinations of muzzle blast and shockwave measurements at each sensor node. The simulation for various scenarios has been performed and analyzed. Imperfections in the placements of microphones within the arrays, uncertainty of sensor locations and time uncertainty in time of arrival estimations are investigated as regards to their effect on system performance. In order to analyze the effect of these imperfections on the calculated shooter position, shooter’s relative direction and bullet direction, a detailed sensitivity analysis has been done. A system calibration method has been developed in this study to reduce imperfections and enhance the shooter localization performance. In addition, acoustic-based shooter localization hardware has been designed within the study. The study involves not only the simulation but also the results of real tests.
Effects of soil deformation and saturation on elastic wave velocities in relation to prediction of rain-induced landslides
 The present means of physical landslide early warning systems make use of moisture sensors or slope deformations sensors. All such sensors are point sensors and are sensitive to variation of physical parameters in the vicinity of sensors only. A large number of sensors are therefore required to cover a wide potential landslide area. An idea to observe soil moisture changes and deformations in slope surface by means of elastic wave propagation in soil is proposed in this paper. Two series of triaxial experiments were conducted as part of this study. The first series of experiments explored the behavior of elastic wave propagation with varying soil moisture. In another series of experiments, soil specimens were subjected to the field stress path experienced by soil elements during rain-induced landslides. The response of elastic wave velocities during rain-induced landslides was envisaged in this test series. It was discovered that both shear, and compression wave velocities decrease by nearly half when soil saturation was increased from 20% to ~ 80%. From the field stress path tests, two distinct phases of rain-induced slope failures were identified. Large change in moisture content of soil was observed in the first phase of failure with the soil deformations being very small. Whereas in the second phase of failure large deformations occurred, with very small increase in moisture content of soil. Both shear, and compression wave velocities decreased gradually in the initial phase, whereas a rapid decrease was observed in the second phase of failure. By observing the change in wave velocities, time of failure initiation and post-failure strain rate could distinctly be identified. Such distinct variation of wave velocities during rain-induced slope failures can be helpful in designing a robust landslide prediction system.
French household travel survey: The next generation
 The French household travel survey (HTS) methodology “Cerema standard” is currently the standard data source for local mobility knowledge in France. However, the major changes in the context led Cerema to begin in 2015 a review of the current methodology and of new data sources which could replace or complete it. This article describes the evaluating process of new survey techniques (Web, GPS) and data sources (mobile phone, smartphone) and its results. For next generation of HTS in the French context, Cerema proposes a modular mechanism with a core and standardized options as a new framework for observing local mobility.
Fibre optic sensors for coal mine hazard detection
 A number of health and safety hazards present in underground coal mines, which include methane gas explosion, coal combustion, rock roof collapse, and flooding etc. Methane gas and coal combustion have been two major hazards, which resulted in most of the heavy casualties and economic losses. Conventional catalytic methane gas sensors suffer from poor accuracy and cumbersome maintenance, which is the bottleneck of methane hazard prevention. Coal mine combustion monitoring has been relying on gas tubing bundles system, which suffers from long time delay and poor reliability. Semiconductor laser diode methane gas sensors have been developed which has low power consumption, 0–100% full detection range and high accuracy, and no need of recalibration. Fibre optic Raman distributed sensors have been deployed in coal mine goaf and successfully detected combustion hazard in early phase. The FOS-based mine hazard detection system offers unique advantages of intrinsic safety, multi-location and multi-parameter monitoring. The application of FOS on monitoring of methane, coal combustion, micro-seismic and equipment condition are described, future trend of research in this area is also discussed.
Temperature measurement of stored biomass using low-frequency acoustic waves and correlation signal processing techniques
 As a substitute of traditional fossil fuels, biomass is widely used to generate electricity and heat. The temperature of stored biomass needs to be monitored continuously to prevent the biomass from self-ignition. This paper proposes a non-intrusive method for the temperature measurement of stored biomass based on acoustic sensing techniques. A characteristic factor is introduced to obtain the sound speed in free space from the measured time of flight of acoustic waves in stored biomass. After analysing the relationship between the defined characteristic factor and air temperature, an updating procedure on the characteristic factor is proposed to reduce the influence of air temperature. By measuring the sound speed in free space, air temperature is determined which is the same as biomass temperature. The proposed methodology is examined using a single path acoustic system which consists of a source and two sensors. A linear chirp signal with a duration of 0.1 s and frequencies of 200–500 Hz is generated and transmitted through stored biomass pellets. The time of flight of sound waves between the two acoustic sensors is measured through correlation signal processing. The relative error of measurement results using the proposed method is no more than 4.5% over the temperature range from 22 °C to 48.9 °C. Factors that affect the temperature measurement are investigated and quantified. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique is effective for the temperature measurement of stored biomass with a maximum error of 1.5 °C under all test conditions.
Real time implementation of H-infinity and RST motion control of rotary traveling wave ultrasonic motor
 This paper deals with design, performances comparison and experimental validation of H-infinity (H∞) and discrete time RST position controllers for a Traveling Wave Ultrasonic Motor (TWUM) which is dedicated to robotic applications. The proposed positioning system shows high precision levels of piezoelectric motor without additional hysteresis and dead zone compensation systems. Moreover, the perturbation rejection capability and the robustness to motor parameters variation are guaranteed. The synthesis procedure of robust H∞ and RST position controllers is detailed. The performances of the proposed controllers are validated by simulation and experimental results.
High efficient driving circuit for traveling wave dielectrophoretic pump
 The micro-fluidic systems based on the dielectrophoresis (DEP) phenomenon have become one of the hottest topics recently. By combining sensor and actuator into a system, a miniature traveling wave dielectrophoretic (TWDEP) pump can be widely used in biomedical applications. As often powered by lower voltage, the actuator of such a system must be minimized yet with adequate capability to drive the DEP pump to the required speed. The driving circuit for the actuator described in this study is designed and tested to attain the purpose of driving a TWDEP pump for whole blood samples. For improving the driving capability, four-phase AC fields were designed and the output levels were increased to double the supply voltage. Quantitative comparison between the driving circuit and function generator by velocity measurement was made. The driving circuit works properly for the steady state operation of the pump.
Impact localization in dispersive waveguides based on energy-attenuation of waves with the traveled distance
 An algorithm is introduced to solve the general multilateration (source localization) problem in a dispersive waveguide. The algorithm is designed with the intention of localizing impact forces in a dispersive floor, and can potentially be used to localize and track occupants in a building using vibration sensors connected to the lower surface of the walking floor. The lower the wave frequencies generated by the impact force, the more accurate the localization is expected to be. An impact force acting on a floor, generates a seismic wave that gets distorted as it travels away from the source. This distortion is noticeable even over relatively short traveled distances, and is mainly caused by the dispersion phenomenon among other reasons, therefore using conventional localization/multilateration methods will produce localization error values that are highly variable and occasionally large. The proposed localization approach is based on the fact that the wave’s energy, calculated over some time window, decays exponentially as the wave travels away from the source. Although localization methods that assume exponential decay exist in the literature (in the field of wireless communications), these methods have only been considered for wave propagation in non-dispersive media, in addition to the limiting assumption required by these methods that the source must not coincide with a sensor location. As a result, these methods cannot be applied to the indoor localization problem in their current form. We show how our proposed method is different from the other methods, and that it overcomes the source-sensor location coincidence limitation. Theoretical analysis and experimental data will be used to motivate and justify the pursuit of the proposed approach for localization in a dispersive medium. Additionally, hammer impacts on an instrumented floor section inside an operational building, as well as finite element model simulations, are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm produces promising results providing a foundation for further future development and optimization.
Highly sensitive biochemical sensor based on nanostructured plasmonic interferometer
 We propose a novel plasmonic interferometric sensor with a slit and surrounding rectangular grooves array on an optically thick gold film for biochemical sensing. We did finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation for design optimization and analytical calculation for characterization of sensitivity in the proposed sensor. Our interferometer is functional for visible to near infrared region with maximum sensitivity of 500 nm/RIU and figure of merit 1933 at 741 nm wavelength. The peak intensity and wavelength change in different refractive indices. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study indicate the potential of the proposed plasmonic interferometer as a low cost, compact, and label-free high-throughput device.
Turbulent drag reduction by traveling wave of flexible wall
 A direct numerical simulation of channel turbulent flow and its control by spanwise traveling waves of flexible wall shows that such an on-wall open-loop vorticity creation control can effectively reduce the friction drag for any incompressible Newtonian fluid. The control effect is similar to that of existing transverse-wave controls by spanwise near-wall oscillating flow/wall oscillation and traveling body-force wave. The main physical mechanism is the change of boundary vorticity flux due to wall acceleration, which forces the streamwise vorticity generated at the wall to be confined in a thin generalized Stokes layer and hence alleviates the low-speed streaks, suppresses the streamwise vortices and hairpin vortices in viscous sublayer, associated with a regularized wall skin-friction pattern. A new potential is revealed toward reducing the power input in open-loop control by waves, which is worth further exploring: the optimization of imposed wave pattern.
Digital communication across orthotropic composite components using guided waves
 Elastic guided waves constitute a promising approach for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications involving composite structures. Guided-wave SHM systems are composed of a network of ultrasonic sensors, which are permanently attached to a structural component. Besides monitoring, the supplementary capability of the network nodes to exchange information across this mechanical wave-guide itself, represents an innovative feature for future intelligent SHM systems. In this research, the wireless transmission of encoded data across a glass-fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plate is demonstrated. Digital communication is based on Lamb waves, which are excited and recorded by piezoceramic transducers. Two distinct processing schemes are explored, namely amplitude modulation (AM) as well as frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), which allows the simultaneous sending from different actuators. The experimental investigation on a transversely isotropic planar wave-guide is accompanied by finite-element (FE) analysis. We have achieved: (i) reliable recovery of sent data, despite the dispersive multi-modal nature of Lamb waves and their multipath propagation, (ii) perfect message reconstruction at bitrates up to approximately 100 kbps, (iii) possibility for parallel communication by means of FDM.
Generating and detecting torsional guided waves using magnetostrictive sensors of crossed coils
 In this work, we propose a crossed-coil magnetostrictive sensor consisting of a solenoid coil, a toroidal coil, and a ferromagnetic patch for generating and detecting torsional waves for pipe inspection. We show that the direction of the magnetic field of the ferromagnetic patch can be controlled by adjusting the input current to the toroidal coil. In addition, it is found that the amplitudes of the signals reflected from the pipe end using a crossed-coil sensor are much larger than those using pre-magnetization techniques, and excitation energies are used to generate the torsional waves only. From results on pipes with multiple circumferential notches, any defects larger in diameter than three times the pipe thickness were detected using the crossed-coil magnetostrictive sensor.
Band structure and Wannier-Stark ladders in the spin wave spectrum
 Two models of Hamiltonians are proposed to describe the propagation of magnetic disturbances within materials whose form is of long and narrow film strips. Both models are defined in terms of special Heisenberg Hamiltonians where it is assumed that the interaction of the spins of the electrons with the structure of the material can be replaced in first approximation by a Hamiltonian of that type. The first one is a one-dimensional periodic Heisenberg Hamiltonian applicable to describe the transport of spin waves in magnonic crystals and it is shown that the associated Schrodinger equation supports analytical solutions and closed expressions are obtained for the dispersion relation and the density of states. This Hamiltonian of course leads to a structure of bands in the spectrum of energies. However, several essential differences are found with respect to the band structure of the well-known Kronig-Penney model. The second model is a Hamiltonian, in principle periodic, but to which a gradient has been added that alters the interaction between the spins. This Hamiltonian only supports numerical solution. This model is applicable to the transport of spin waves in magnetic crystals in the presence of some external agent. For example a temperature gradient, exposure to some non-uniform luminous signal, a non-uniform chemical attack, etc., which modifies the constant interactions from spin to spin. It is shown that in this case the original band structure is completely destroyed and under certain circumstances it appears a series of resonances which are similar to the Wannier-Stark ladder resonances.
Absolute stress field measurement in structural steel members using the Lcr wave method
 The absolute stress in structural steel members is an important indicator of the performance of steel structures. Among the existing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, ultrasonic methods have received the most research attention. The existing ultrasonic methods can evaluate the average stress in a fixed acoustic path but cannot easily measure the stress field within the tested objects. We present a non-destructive method to evaluate the absolute stress field in a structural steel member using longitudinal critically refracted (Lcr) waves. Specifically, a theoretical expression is derived for absolute stress measurement. A measurement system is developed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. A sensor group, which contains one transmitter and two receiver transducers connected by a Vernier calliper, is designed to transmit and receive Lcr waves. The proposed method is applied to two steel members with variable cross-sections. The traditional strain gauge method is used for verification. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently evaluate the stress distribution and stress extremum in structural steel members.
A cylindrical traveling wave ultrasonic motor using longitudinal and bending composite transducer
 A cylindrical type traveling wave ultrasonic motor using longitudinal and bening composite transducer was proposed in this paper. A composite transducer is attached to the cylinder on its outer surface to excite two degenerate flexural vibration modes spatially and temporally orthogonal to each other in the cylinder. In this new design, a single transducer can excite a flexural traveling wave in the cylinder. Two cone type rotors are pressed in contact to the borders of the inner surface of teeth by means of a spring and nut system. The working principle of the motor was analyzed. The resonance frequencies of the two vibration modes of stator were tuned to be close to one another using finite element method. A prototype motor was fabricated and tested. Typical output of the prototype is no-load speed of 281 rpm and maximum torque of 1.2 N m at an exciting voltage of 200 Vrms.
A sensor enabled secure vehicular communication for emergency message dissemination using cloud services
 A Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) entails smart vehicles on the road to provide communication services among nearby vehicles. It is ideated with the intention to develop applications that are versatile and efficient. Due to its dynamic nature, achieving a secure and reliable communication via VANET is a crucial challenge. Hence, varied security mechanisms are developed conventionally. But there were limitations such as increased delay, bandwidth usage, limited security, and reduced communication efficiency. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a protocol namely, Sensor Enabled Secure Vehicular Communication (SSVC) to enable a secure and reliable communication in VANET. The objectives of this paper are to reduce the latency, and to improve the communication efficiency of the network. At first, a network is formed with n number of vehicles and neighbor discovery is performed via Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) protocol. Further, the sensors attached with the vehicle machinery are used to obtain information such as, air pressure, temperature, and speed of the vehicle. These information are stored in a gateway and the vehicles of the network are registered in a gateway by generating a unique ID and password to each vehicle. A cloud connection is enabled to broadcast the emerging messages to all the vehicles. Also, blowfish technique is implemented to store the location information of the vehicle in the cloud in a secure manner. This improves the security level of the vehicular communication. Different performance measures are used to evaluate the results of the proposed system via simulations. Then the results are compared with the existing mechanism to prove the efficiency of the proposed SSVC mechanism.
Tidally-generated internal waves in Southeast Hudson Bay
 The location of the amphidromic point of the M2 tide in Hudson Bay roughly coincides with Belcher Islands, a region where the surface mixed layer stays relatively fresh throughout summer and winter due to significant ice melt and river discharge. High-resolution satellite radar imagery for the ice-free season revealed that the coastal region in the south-east Belcher Islands is a hot spot for short-period internal wave activity. For a first investigation of tidal dynamics in the region, we took advantage of the sea ice platform to deploy an ice-tethered mooring consisting of nine conductivity and temperature sensors and an acoustic Doppler current profiler. The mooring was deployed at 65 m depth in January–March 2014 in a narrow channel between Broomfield and O′Leary islands located in the south-east tip of the Belcher Islands group in Hudson Bay (56°20′N, 79°30′W), northeast Canada. The surface mixed layer under the land-fast ice in this area stays relatively fresh through winter presumably because of significant winter river discharge in nearby James Bay. The mooring recorded oscillations of temperature and salinity throughout the whole water column, which were attributed to vertical displacement caused by internal tidal waves. The tidal harmonic analysis performed for the M2 tidal constituent showed the dominance of the baroclinic tide with maximum velocity amplitudes at the surface and decreasing with depth. Vertical displacements of water parcels derived from both temperature and salinity were statistically similar and displayed the maximum values of 11.9 m at 35 m (instrument depth). The combination of winter hydrographic data and summer satellite observations confirmed that the observed internal waves were generated by the interaction of strong tides, typical for Hudson Bay, with highly variable bottom topography south-east of the Belcher Islands archipelago.
A New Fluid Bearing Utilizing Traveling Waves
 A new non-contact fluid bearing, which utilizes traveling waves, is proposed in the present research. The moving part is supported with a thin fluid film compressed by the waves traveling radially on the bearing surface. Conventional hydrostatic bearings utilize externally compressed fluid, which requires plumbing and compressors. On the other hand, the proposed bearing realizes non-contact smooth motion without such a large apparatus, and furthermore it has a capability to electrically control the bearing force or clearance. A prototype air bearing is developed on the basis of the proposed principle by utilizing piezo-electric actuators, and its non-contact smooth motion is confirmed.
Optimization of SAW and EIS sensors suitable for environmental particulate monitoring
 Aerosol particulate matter (PM) is a known risk factor for lung and liver cancer. In particular, PM under 1 μm in diameter (PM1) is very dangerous for health, affecting the respiratory system with several heavy outcomes and reaching other human districts like liver, where foreign substances are processed. Today PM1 is still difficult to be detected on-field with standard techniques and this paper reports a comparison between two sensing approaches for environmental particulate monitoring, which are suitable for miniaturization and integration into portable and low-cost devices. Specifically, transducers based on surface acoustic waves (SAW) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were comparatively investigated as alternatives to more common but also expensive optical methods. Moreover, their performances were evaluated for the detection of nanoparticles of different dimensions (1 μm, 200 nm and 40 nm) to mimic different compositions of PM1 and reach a size scale which is an order of magnitude below present literature. Notably, both transduction methods were able to detect the presence of PM1 particulate. The SAW-based approach showed better performances in terms of sensitivity and detection of nanoscale particles, although the EIS strategy has a competitive sensitivity considering also its even lower cost.
Experimental Investigation on a Linear-compressor Driven Travelling-wave Thermoacoustic Heat Pump
 Heat pump system, offering economical alternatives in recovering waste heat from different sources for using in various industrial, commercial and residential applications, is considered to be a very environmentally-friendly heat and power transfer system. In this paper, to solve the problems of traditional vapour compression heat pump working in unconventional conditions, a novel TWTAHP (travelling-wave thermoacoustic heat pump) is presented to meet the requirement of working in ultra-low temperature. Base on the theoretical simulation and structure optimization, an experimental apparatus for preliminary test has been built, which is only one single independent unit from the whole loop of the TWTAHP system. The results show that the simulation and the testing results were agreeable as expected. Under the -20°C environment temperature and the 50°C heating temperature, we could obtain a maximal COPh (heating COP) of 2.1 and 260W heating capacity for one unit by consuming acoustic power less than 200W. Furthermore, a COPh above 3.0 could be achieved when the ambient temperature was raised to 0°C.
Applications of a nanocomposite-inspired in-situ broadband ultrasonic sensor to acousto-ultrasonics-based passive and active structural health monitoring
 A novel nanocomposite-inspired in-situ broadband ultrasonic sensor previously developed, with carbon black as the nanofiller and polyvinylidene fluoride as the matrix, was networked for acousto-ultrasonic wave-based passive and active structural health monitoring (SHM). Being lightweight and small, this kind of sensor was proven to be capable of perceiving strain perturbation in virtue of the tunneling effect in the formed nanofiller conductive network when acousto-ultrasonic waves traverse the sensor. Proof-of-concept validation was implemented, to examine the sensor performance in responding to acousto-ultrasonic waves in a broad frequency regime: from acoustic emission (AE) of lower frequencies to guided ultrasonic waves (GUWs) of higher frequencies. Results have demonstrated the high fidelity, ultrafast response and high sensitivity of the sensor to acousto-ultrasonic waves up to 400 kHz yet with an ultra-low magnitude (of the order of micro-strain). The sensor is proven to possess sensitivity and accuracy comparable with commercial piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, whereas with greater flexibility in accommodating curved structural surfaces. Application paradigms of using the sensor for damage evaluation have spotlighted the capability of the sensor in compromising “sensing cost” with “sensing effectiveness” for passive AE- or active GUW-based SHM.
Low-cost wave characterization modules for oil spill response
 Marine oil spills can be remediated by mechanical skimmers in calm waters, but performance degrades with increased wave height. We have developed and demonstrated a system that quantifies local wave characteristics with an uncertainty of four inches of heave. Our system is intended for the measurement of wave characteristics during oil spill recovery. It conveys this information to coordinators and responders in real time via WiFi and remote reporting through a satellite network. This information will allow for enhanced situational awareness during an oil spill response, assisting stakeholders and optimizing mechanical skimming operations. Our wave characterization module (WCM) uses accelerometer outputs from a very small inertial measurement unit (IMU) to generate wave statistics and calculate wave characteristics. It is configured such that a WCM can either be attached to a skimmer float or incorporated into a microbuoy. Wave height and period are transmitted via WiFi and/or a satellite-enabled mesh-grid network to a cloud-hosted geographic information system (GIS). Here, we discuss the bare-bones sensors-plus-algorithm approach we developed by using spring-mass systems to approximate the wave height and period regime of interest. We then describe open water tests carried out using that development system both mounted to a weir skimmer mockup and packaged in a microbuoy. Finally, we present controlled tests in the wave tank at Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility in New Jersey, with the WCMs communicating the wave characteristics via WiFi to tankside laptops and via satellite to the cloud-based GIS. Snapshot determinations of wave height calculated using the scalar magnitude of the three-axis accelerometer in the IMU were within four inches of the benchmark wave measurement system at Ohmsett.
The seismic wave motion camouflage of large carnivorous dinosaurs
 Living elephants produce seismic waves during vocalizations and locomotion that are potentially detectable at large distances. In the Mesozoic world, seismic waves were probably a very relevant source of information about the behavior of large dinosaurs. In this work, we study the relationship between foot shape and the directivity pattern of seismic waves generated during locomotion. For enlarged foot morphologies (based on a morphological index) of theropod dinosaurs, there is a marked effect of seismic wave directivity at 20 m. This effect is not important in the foot morphologies of other dinosaurs, including the foot shapes of herbivores and theropods such as therizinosaurids. This directivity produces a lower intensity in the forward direction that would slightly reduce the probability of detection of an ambush predator. Even more relevant is the fact that during the approach of a predator, the intensity of seismic waves detected by potential prey remains constant in the mentioned distance range. This effect hides the predator's approach, and we call this “seismic wave camouflage”. We also discuss the potential relationship of this effect with enlarged fossil footprints assigned to metatarsal support.
Recent development of fiber-optic chemical sensors and biosensors: Mechanisms, materials, micro/nano-fabrications and applications
 The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade and will significantly reshape human life from every aspect, e.g., defense, environmental monitoring, energy, food safety, knowledge dissemination, healthcare and so on. Fiber-optic sensors, with both communication and sensing functions, have become a bridge to connect people and the whole world, so they are essential parts for accelerating the development of the IoT. Fiber-optic sensors possess the capability of translating a change of target analyte into optical signals and subsequently transmit an optical signal with target analyte information to people, machines or systems in real-time, even from a long distance. Therefore, exploration of high-performance fiber-optic chemical sensors and biosensors could significantly promote the development of the IoT. This review paper presents the foundations of fiber-optic chemical sensing or biosensing, including the sensing mechanisms of various fiber-optic sensors, sensing materials and the novel techniques for sensing materials deposition. Furthermore, recent developments on fiber-optic chemical sensors and biosensors are summarized, analyzed and discussed. Finally, the strategies and guidelines to further promote the development of fiber-optic sensors are also discussed.
Signal processing in SPR fiber sensors: Some remarks and a new method
 The importance of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based devices in the field of chemical and biological sensing and the expectations created in terms of sensitivity and resolution impose the necessity of developing an adequate methodology for the processing of the signals obtained and for the evaluation of the performance of the sensing systems. We discuss in depth and clarify the problem of the analysis of data acquiring and processing in SPR fiber sensors, show how in many cases this analysis could and must be improved and propose a new method of SPR curve shaping, apt for sensors encapsulated or inaccesible. We illustrate the use of the method with real experimental examples.
Enhancement of refrigeration performance by energy transfer of shock wave
 The objective of this paper is to enhance the refrigeration performance by energy transfer of shock wave. The matching of shock compression and expansion refrigeration is the key to research. Firstly, the efficiency of shock wave transfer energy is discussed. Then, a two dimensional numerical model of wave rotor refrigeration is established. And wave diagram is drawn by numerical calculation, which reveals the principle of refrigeration and the relationship between pressurization and refrigeration. Finally, an experimental platform was established and experiment work is carried out to obtain performance parameters. The results show that shock wave compression is close to isentropic compression. Using the shock wave, the expansion work of refrigeration can be efficiently recovered. Under the design condition, about 50% of pressure energy could be restored. There are three main shock waves in the channels. Only shock wave S1 can be exploited to enhance refrigeration and other shock waves should be avoided. There is an optimum value for the pressure of high temperature port, which observably affects the temperature drop of the novel refrigerator. Under the experimental condition, the performance curves of the refrigerator and temperature distribution in refrigerator are obtained.
Numerical investigation of spatial and temporal structure of annular flow with disturbance waves
 Droplet entrainment is a crucial process for annular flow in terms of heat and mass transfer. Disturbance wave is believed to be a fundamental phenomenon which is closely related to entrainment. A 3D numerical simulation on disturbance waves and entrainment is carried out by using volume of fluid (VOF) method where no periodic boundary condition is used. Since VOF tracks the interface implicitly, a systematic method is developed for post-processing, with which disturbance waves, ripples, base film, and entrainment process are clearly visualized, and the stochastic and chaotic nature of two-phase flow is confirmed. Surfacewise distributions are generated for main wave parameters, and the streamwise developments of such quantities are shown to be consistent with experimental observations. Predictions for main wave parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experiment and empirical correlations. Current work shows the capability and promising application of investigating disturbance waves and entrainment with VOF method.
Analytical and experimental investigation of the interaction of Lamb waves in a stiffened aluminum plate with a horizontal crack at the root of the stiffener
 This paper addresses an analytical and experimental analysis based on the physics of the Lamb wave propagation and interaction with the discontinuity. An analytical method called “complex modes expansion with vector projection (CMEP)” is used to calculate the scattering coefficients (amplitude of the out-of-plane velocity) of Lamb wave modes from geometric discontinuities. Two cases are considered in this research: (a) a plate with a pristine stiffener and (b) a plate with a cracked stiffener. Complex-valued scattering coefficients are calculated from 50 kHz to 350 kHz for A0 incident waves. Scatter coefficients are compared for both cases to identify a suitable frequency range to excite Lamb waves using a piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS) to detect the crack. The frequency-dependent complex-valued scatter coefficients are then inserted into the global analytical model. The global analytical solution predicts time domain scattered signal from the discontinuity. The crack can be detected by comparing the waveforms for pristine stiffener and cracked stiffener. An experiment was conducted for both pristine stiffener and cracked stiffener to compare with the analytical results. A long PWAS was placed parallel to the waveform to create straight crested Lamb wave modes in the plate. Antisymmetric Lamb wave modes were selectively excited by using two PWAS transducers placed on opposite sides of the plate and energized by out-of-phase signals. A single-point laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) was used to measure the out-of-plane velocity of scattered Lamb waves on the plate. The obtained experimental results agree well with the analytical predictions.
Numerical simulation on onset characteristics of traveling-wave thermoacoustic engines based on a time-domain network model
 Onset characteristics of thermoacoustic engines are of great importance for understanding the internal working mechanisms of thermoacoustic conversion. A one-dimensional time-domain network model for predicting the onset characteristics of traveling-wave thermoacoustic engines with helium as working gas is built. The acoustic resistance, inertance, compliance, and thermal-relaxation effects of all the acoustic components are included. The viscous and heat transfer terms in the time-domain governing equations of the acoustic tubes and the heat exchangers are deduced from the frequency-domain linear thermoacoustic theory. Combining the time-domain governing equations of the regenerator, numerical simulations of the whole onset process are then conducted in a wide operating condition range. The complete dynamic pressure wave evolution processes are simulated successfully. It is shown that a steady standing-wave acoustic field forms in almost all parts of the traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine except for the regenerator area. Onset temperature, operating frequency, and quality factor are calculated with a relatively high accuracy. The thermal relaxation effects in the regenerator are found to have a remarkable impact on the onset characteristics, especially at high mean pressures. It is also shown that the experimental damping temperature is closer to the calculated onset temperature than the experimental onset temperature. Furthermore, the reasonable distributions of the pressure and volume flow rate and the phase relationship between them in the whole system are obtained and analyzed.

The current and possible future applications will then be reviewed. The requirements which commercial SMOX based sensors must meet will be discussed. In total the chapter offers a comprehensive overview of the development and application of SMOX sensors.
Effect of wood anisotropy in ultrasonic wave propagation: A ray-tracing approach
 Ultrasonic nondestructive imaging methods allow analyzing the inner structures of trees, without altering their condition. In this study, we are interested in evaluating the influence of anisotropy condition in the wood on the ultrasonic waves time-of-flight (TOF) estimation, by means of a raytracing approach. This technique is used particularly in the field of exploration seismography to simulate wavefronts in elastic media. Wood sections from two species were tested. Defects in the wood were simulated by drilling holes. Defects were tested in two positions, centric and eccentric, and three different defect diameters were used for each position. First, experiments with healthy wood showed that the orthotropic behavior resulted in curved rays from the transmitter to every receiver, compared to the straight-line paths for the isotropic case, considering that the radial direction presents a higher wave velocity. Defects inside the wood resulted in low velocity propagation areas, that modified the trajectories compared to the healthy case. Centric defects resulted in larger TOF variations than eccentric defects. A combination of centric position and bigger size corresponded to a higher probability of decay detection using a tomographic image. To increase the tomographic image quality, curved rays should be considered when performing the image reconstruction.
Investigating the use of multi-point coupling for single-sensor bearing estimation in one direction
 Bearing estimation of radially propagating symmetric waves in solid structures typically requires a minimum of two sensors. As a test specimen, this research investigates the use of multi-point coupling to provide directional inference using a single-sensor. By this provision, the number of sensors required for localization can be reduced. A finite-element model of a beam is constructed with a symmetrically placed bipod that has asymmetric joint-stiffness properties. Impulse loading is applied at different points along the beam, and measurements are taken from the apex of the bipod. A technique is developed to determine the direction-of-arrival of the propagating wave. The accuracy when using the bipod with the developed technique is compared against results gathered without the bipod and measuring from an asymmetric location along the beam. The results show 92% accuracy when the bipod is used, compared to 75% when measuring without the bipod from an asymmetric location. A geometry investigation finds the best accuracy results when one leg of the bipod has a low stiffness and a large diameter relative to the other leg.
Integrated thin-film piezoelectric traveling wave ultrasonic motors
 An integrated approach to the fabrication of thin-film piezoelectric traveling wave ultrasonic motors at the mm-scale is being developed for low power, high torque motors for small scale robotics, biomedical, and sensing applications. This paper describes the realization of ultrasonic motor stators ranging in diameter from 1 to 3 mm using wafer scale MEMS fabrication techniques with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. Using laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), controlled traveling waves were demonstrated in the bulk silicon elastic medium of the stator and the standing wave behavior was characterized for control purposes. Furthermore, the resonant modes of the fabricated stators were modeled using finite element models, and experimental results agree well with this analysis.
Traveling-load calibration of grid-array transient contact stress sensors
 Thin, pliant transducers with grid arrays of sensing elements (sensels) have been widely used for transient measurements of intra-articular contact stresses. Conventional calibration procedures for this class of sensors are based upon spatially uniform scaling of sensel output values so as to recover two known fiducial loads, physically applied with the sensor either compressed between platens or mounted in situ. Because of the nonlinearities involved, it is desirable to have the highest of those two calibration loadings be such that all individual sensels are engaged at/near the peak of their expected functional range. However, for many situations of practical interest, impracticably large total calibration forces would be required. We report development of a novel pneumatically actuated wringer-like calibration device, and companion iterative post-processing software, that bypasses this longstanding difficulty. Sensors passed through the rollers of this device experience constant-distribution traveling fiducial loads propagating across their surface, thus allowing efficient calibration of all sensels individually to contact stress levels that would be impracticably high to simultaneously apply to all sensels. Sensel-specific calibration curves are rapidly and easily generated using this new approach and compare favorably to those obtained with less expeditious conventional platen-based protocols.
High-sensitive ultrasonic sensor using fiber-tip PVC diaphragm Fabry-Perot interferometer and its imaging application
 A polyvinyl chloride (PVC) diaphragm based on fiber-tip Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) is proposed and demonstrated experimentally for ultrasonic wave (UW) three-dimensional imaging. The sensor probe is created by coating the PVC diaphragm to the end facet of a well-cut single mode fiber (SMF) using a plastic welder. The probe performs with an ultra-high UW sensitivity due to high pressure sensitivity of the PVC, and thus is capable of detecting gradient seismic physical models with different angles. By scanning the model using the proposed sensor in water and three-dimensional signals reconstruction, the imaging of the spherical model is achieved.
On the exploitation of mode localization in surface acoustic wave MEMS
 Mode localization sensing has been recently introduced as an alternative resonant sensing protocol. It has been shown to exhibit several advantages over other resonant methods, in particular a potential for higher sensitivity and rejection of common mode noise. This paper expounds the principles of utilising surface acoustic waves (SAW) to create a mode localization sensor. A generalised geometry consisting of a pair of coupled resonant cavities is introduced and an analytical solution found for the displacement fields within the cavities. The solution is achieved by coupling the internal cavity solutions using a ray tracing method. The results of the analytical solution are compared to a numerical solution found using commercial finite element method (FEM) software; exact agreement is found between the two solutions. The insight gained from the analytical model enables the determination of critical design parameters. A brief analysis is presented showing analogous operation to previous examples of mode localization sensors. The sensitivity of the device is shown to depend nonlinearly on the number of periods in the array coupling the two cavities.
Multi-physical field guided wave simulation for circular concrete-filled steel tubes coupled with piezoelectric patches considering debonding defects
 The active interface debonding detection for concrete-filled steel tubes (CFSTs) using Piezoelectric Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) patches has been proposed and experimentally studied in recent years. In order to further investigate the guided wave propagation and the response of embedded PZT sensor, transient dynamic analysis on multi-physical field coupling models composed of surface-mounted PZT actuator, embedded PZT sensor and a circular CFST specimen considering the coupling effect between the PZT patches and CFST member and the influence of interface debonding defects is carried out numerically. The guided wave propagation within the CFST-PZT coupling system without and with interfacial debonding defects under single period impulse signal is simulated and compared. The voltage response time history of the embedded PZT sensor in coupling models under both sinusoidal and sweep frequency sinusoidal excitations are simulated as an alternative solver. Numerical results demonstrate that interface debonding leads to changes in guided wave propagation path, traveling time and the PZT sensor response. The sensitivity of a quantitative evaluation index called as the normalized wavelet packet energy of the output voltage of embedded PZT sensor to the initiation of interface debonding defect and its length and depth is illustrated.
A novel capacitive absolute positioning sensor based on time grating with nanometer resolution
 The present work proposes a novel capacitive absolute positioning sensor based on time grating. The sensor includes a fine incremental-displacement measurement component combined with a coarse absolute-position measurement component to obtain high-resolution absolute positioning measurements. A single row type sensor was proposed to achieve fine displacement measurement, which combines the two electrode rows of a previously proposed double-row type capacitive displacement sensor based on time grating into a single row. To achieve absolute positioning measurement, the coarse measurement component is designed as a single-row type displacement sensor employing a single spatial period over the entire measurement range. In addition, this component employs a rectangular induction electrode and four groups of orthogonal discrete excitation electrodes with half-sinusoidal envelope shapes, which were formed by alternately extending the rectangular electrodes of the fine measurement component. The fine and coarse measurement components are tightly integrated to form a compact absolute positioning sensor. A prototype sensor was manufactured using printed circuit board technology for testing and optimization of the design in conjunction with simulations. Experimental results show that the prototype sensor achieves a ±300 nm measurement accuracy with a 1 nm resolution over a displacement range of 200 mm when employing error compensation. The proposed sensor is an excellent alternative to presently available long-range absolute nanometrology sensors owing to its low cost, simple structure, and ease of manufacturing.
Acoustically generated flows in microchannel flexural plate wave sensors: Effects of compressibility
 Acoustically generated flowfields in flexural plate wave sensors filled with a Newtonian liquid (water) are considered. A computational model based on compressible flow is developed for the sensor with a moving wall for pumping and mixing applications in microchannels. For the compressible flow formulation, an isothermal equation of state for water is employed. The velocity and pressure profiles for different parameters including flexural wall frequency, channel height, amplitude of the wave and wave length are investigated for four microchannel height/length geometries. It is found that the flowfield becomes pseudo-steady after sufficient number of flexural cycles. Both instantaneous and time averaged results show that an evanescent wave is generated in the microchannel. The predicted flows generated by the FPWs are compared with results available in the literature. The proposed device can be exploited to integrate micropumps with complex microfluidic chips improving the portability of micro-total-analysis systems.
A utilizing efficiency estimation method for wave-driven unmanned surface vehicle
 A wave-driven unmanned surface vehicle (WUSV) can sail on the sea simply by utilizing wave energy as its driving power. Recently, many studies have been performed on practical applications of oceanic scientific exploration by a WUSV, where the estimation criterion of the navigation performance of the WUSV is always its sailing velocity, although this method is very intuitive but not effective in analyzing the shortcomings in the design of the WUSV. On this basis, a new estimation method, which focuses on the efficiency of utilizing wave energy by the WUSV, is proposed in this paper. The theoretical contribution of this paper is that a generalized solution function for the efficiency of utilizing wave energy is obtained and is expressed in the form of the product of several non-dimensional parameters. In detail, algorithms to calculate input power, i.e., wave energy harvested by the surface float, and usable power, i.e., the product of sailing velocity and thrust force, have been developed. The other development presented in this paper is the proposal of some effective ways to improve the ability of the WUSV to utilize wave energy. Then, numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed method, and corresponding experiments are employed to investigate the performance of the method. The results show that the four major factors to impact the ability of the WUSV utilize wave energy are the thrust force of the propulsor, the sailing velocity of the WUSV, the principal dimensions of structures and the wave environment parameters. Summarizing the analysis in numerical validations and experimental studies, the WUSV can generally achieve higher efficiency in utilizing wave energy when it sails in a specific wave environment with certain parameters. Meanwhile, the utilization efficiency of the WUSV is not always much higher, and the reasons for this phenomenon mainly include two aspects: (1) most of the wave energy harvested by the surface float is used to work against the calm water resistance of the propulsor and the umbilical cable; and (2) based on the current design, the motions of the surface float cannot fully respond to the waves. Therefore, an integrated optimizing design for the propulsive and resistance performance of the propulsor, as well as the motion response and resistance performance of the float, will be an effective way to improve the ability of the WUSV to utilize wave energy. In addition, the differences in the sailing velocity and heaving amplitude of foils cause different curve trends for the utilizing efficiency between numerical simulations and experiments.
GaN/SiC based surface acoustic wave structures for hydrogen sensors with enhanced sensitivity
 In this article, we present an application of GaN/SiC heterostructures for Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) hydrogen sensors with enhanced sensitivity. We demonstrate that the mass-loading sensitivity of such sensors can be increased by using shorter acoustic wavelengths and by confining the acoustic wave energy in an epitaxial waveguide. The effect of different Rayleigh-like modes on the mass-loading sensitivity is also discussed. The SAW wavelength-dependent phase and group velocity and electromechanical coupling constants were determined from electrical measurements. The outcome was used to design a microwave SAW delay-line oscillator. Its sensing characteristics are presented. The oscillator frequency shift was larger than 60 kHz after exposure to 1000 ppm H2/N2. The sensor reaction time was about 12 s for the same sensing conditions at room temperature.
Acoustic tomography based on hybrid wave propagation model for tree decay detection
 Acoustic wave technologies have been used in wood defect detection for many years. Various tomographic imaging algorithms have been proposed to construct two dimensional acoustic velocity maps that serve as the scientific evidence of tree’s internal condition. Many previously proposed algorithms were based on the assumption that acoustic waves propagate along straight rays in the cross sections of trees. To simulate the acoustic wave propagation more realistically, this paper proposed a tomographic imaging method based on a hybrid wave propagation model (HWPM) that includes two velocity inversion phases: straight-ray inversion and curved-ray inversion. The straight-ray inversion was first applied to obtain the preliminary velocity distribution, followed by the curved-ray inversion to refine the velocity distribution. A velocity correction factor was determined for each grid cell following each inversion iteration, and then was used to derive a new velocity value for each corresponding cell. The maximum and minimum velocity constraints were imposed on the newly-computed velocities, and some velocity constraints of grid cells were also imposed to address the nonuniqueness problem commonly existed in velocity inversion and generate a more accurate tomographic image. To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid inversion method, we conducted multipath acoustic wave testing on three short log sections (one sound and two with artificial defect) in the laboratory and four live trees in Yangzhou Slender West Lake Park, Jiangsu Province, China. Time-of-flight data was collected by PiCUS Tomograph tool and used to generate tomographic images with both Simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and the proposed hybrid inversion method to make a comparison. Micro-drilling tests were conducted on the live trees to determine the internal condition and served as the basis for evaluating the tomographic images. Our results indicate that the hybrid wave propagation model is effective in constructing acoustic tomographic images that are reasonably accurate in detecting the internal defects of urban trees.
A wave-by-wave analysis for the evaluation of the breaking-wave celerity
 The paper gives an overall description of the breaking-wave celerity on the basis of a wave-by-wave analysis that has been performed by using field data collected during the ECORS Project (Truc Vert Beach, France, 2008). Data coming from two pressure sensors have been analyzed with the aim to correlate, after a zero-crossing analysis, each wave of both signals. The method is based on a first correlation between 10′ time windows of both signals and, then, on the individuation of the correct time lag for each wave. Such data, which reveals a quasi-gaussian behavior of the breaking wave celerity, have also been used to relate the wave celerity with suitable wave characteristics, and comparisons are made with the most common formulas that can be found in the literature. The wave-by-wave method, validated by means of suitable laboratory test data, gives good results in the evaluation of the celerity, especially when it is made to depend on both a velocity scale and the wave non-linearity parameter. Further, a comparison with literature models used for the prediction of breaking wave celerity suggests good performances of both solitary-wave (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.79) and shock-wave (R2 = 0.71) theories, that give results well matched to the field data.
Infragravity waves: From driving mechanisms to impacts
 Infragravity (hereafter IG) waves are surface ocean waves with frequencies below those of wind-generated “short waves” (typically below 0.04 Hz). Here we focus on the most common type of IG waves, those induced by the presence of groups in incident short waves. Three related mechanisms explain their generation: (1) the development, shoaling and release of waves bound to the short-wave group envelopes (2) the modulation by these envelopes of the location where short waves break, and (3) the merging of bores (breaking wave front, resembling to a hydraulic jump) inside the surfzone. When reaching shallow water (O(1–10 m)), IG waves can transfer part of their energy back to higher frequencies, a process which is highly dependent on beach slope. On gently sloping beaches, IG waves can dissipate a substantial amount of energy through depth-limited breaking. When the bottom is very rough, such as in coral reef environments, a substantial amount of energy can be dissipated through bottom friction. IG wave energy that is not dissipated is reflected seaward, predominantly for the lowest IG frequencies and on steep bottom slopes. This reflection of the lowest IG frequencies can result in the development of standing (also known as stationary) waves. Reflected IG waves can be refractively trapped so that quasi-periodic along-shore patterns, also referred to as edge waves, can develop. IG waves have a large range of implications in the hydro-sedimentary dynamics of coastal zones. For example, they can modulate current velocities in rip channels and strongly influence cross-shore and longshore mixing. On sandy beaches, IG waves can strongly impact the water table and associated groundwater flows. On gently sloping beaches and especially under storm conditions, IG waves can dominate cross-shore sediment transport, generally promoting offshore transport inside the surfzone. Under storm conditions, IG waves can also induce overwash and eventually promote dune erosion and barrier breaching. In tidal inlets, IG waves can propagate into the back-barrier lagoon during the flood phase and induce large modulations of currents and sediment transport. Their effect appears to be smaller during the ebb phase, due to blocking by countercurrents, particularly in shallow systems. On coral and rocky reefs, IG waves can dominate over short-waves and control the hydro-sedimentary dynamics over the reef flat and in the lagoon. In harbors and semi-enclosed basins, free IG waves can be amplified by resonance and induce large seiches (resonant oscillations). Lastly, free IG waves that are generated in the nearshore can cross oceans and they can also explain the development of the Earth's “hum” (background free oscillations of the solid earth).
Comparison of disturbance wave parameters with flow orientation in vertical annular gas-liquid flows in a small pipe
 The interfacial wave structure of the liquid film in both upward and downward annular gas-liquid flows in an 11.7 mm pipe were investigated using the Brightness Based Laser Induced Fluorescence technique (BBLIF). Film thickness measurements were carried out with high spatial and temporal resolution between 330 and 430 mm from the inlet, where the properties of disturbance waves are almost stabilised. Using a tracking algorithm to detect disturbance waves, a full characterisation in terms of their velocity, frequency, longitudinal size and spacing was carried out. Direct comparison between both flow orientations while testing the same flow conditions shows that although the flow orientation does not affect the velocity of disturbance waves, the fraction of film surface occupied by the disturbance waves is smaller in upwards flow. Thus, more liquid travels in the base film in upwards flow, which is consistent with the base film thickness measurements. These observations, together with qualitatively different behaviour of ripple wave velocity in upwards and downwards flows, studied using 2D Fourier analysis, indicate that the role of gravity is much more important on the base film than on disturbance waves. This supposedly occurs due to a local decrease in the interfacial shear stress on the base film surface because of the resistance of the disturbance waves to the gas stream in upward flow.
Wear properties of brass and PTFE–matrix composite in traveling wave ultrasonic motors
 The wear of a traveling wave ultrasonic motor has certain particularities due to its special drive mechanism. In this investigation, the progression of wear of a brass stator against a PTFE–matrix composite friction material is reported. During 200 h of operation, the performances of an ultrasonic motor and the properties of its friction surfaces were examined. Different wear stages were observed. Surface topography and debris characteristics were analyzed to assess the wear mechanisms that operate in different wear stages. Under the imposed operating conditions the running-in wear stage requires 80 h. In early period of running-in wear stage, adhesive wear is the main wear mechanism of the friction material. The debris forms a multi-layered, agglomerate sheet. In the second part of the running-in period, the main wear mechanisms change to delamination wear and adhesive wear. The debris piles up as small particles. In the steady wear stage, the main wear mechanism is delamination wear result from fatigue. The debris forms small flake-like sheet but they are rare. Abrasive wear exist in all stages of wear. By contrast, the main wear mechanism of the brass stator is abrasive wear.
Dominance of debonding defect of CFST on PZT sensor response considering the meso-scale structure of concrete with multi-scale simulation
 Piezoelectric-lead-zirconate-titanate(PZT)-based interface debonding defects detection for concrete filled steel tubulars (CFSTs) has been proposed and validated through experiments, and numerical study on its mechanism has been carried out recently by assuming that concrete material is homogenous. However, concrete is composed of coarse and fine aggregates, mortar and interface transition zones (ITZs) and even initial defects and is a typical nonhomogeneous material and its mesoscale structure might affect the wave propagation in the concrete core of CFST members. Therefore, it is significantly important to further investigate the influence of mesoscale structure of concrete on the stress wave propagation and the response of embedded PZT sensor for the interface debonding detection. In this study, multi-physical numerical simulation on the wave propagation and embedded PZT sensor response of rectangular CFST members with numerical concrete core considering the randomness in circular aggregate distribution, and coupled with surface-mounted PZT actuator and embedded PZT sensor is carried out. The effect of randomness in the circular aggregates distribution and the existence of ITZs are discussed. Both a local stress wave propagation behavior including transmission, reflection, and diffraction at the interface between concrete core and steel tube under a pulse signal excitation and a global wave field in the cross-section of the rectangular CFST models without and with interface debonding defects under sweep frequency excitation are simulated. The sensitivity of an evaluation index based on wavelet packet analysis on the embedded PZT sensor response on the variation of mesoscale parameters of concrete core without and with different interface debonding defects under sweep frequency voltage signal is investigated in details. The results show that the effect of the interface debondings on the embedded PZT measurement is dominant when compared to the meso-scale structures of concrete core. This study verified the feasibility of the PZT based debonding detection for rectangular CFST members even the meso-scale structure of concrete core is considered.
Passive wireless surface acoustic wave CO2 sensor with carbon nanotube nanocomposite as an interface layer
 A passive wireless CO2 sensing system based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) device and carbon nanotube nanocomposite thin film was studied. The electrical resistance change of the carbon nanotube nanocomposite thin film was examined first, and about 10% resistance increase was observed when the thin film is exposed to pure CO2. The frequency change for SAW sensor coated with nanocomposites film was around 0.03% when the device is exposed to pure CO2. However, the performance of the CO2 SAW sensor is severely influenced by environmental humidity. With additional ultrathin parylene film packaging, the SAW sensor frequency change from relative humidity of 0–100% at room temperature decreased from over 0.1% to less than 0.01%. It was found that the lowest detection limit of the CO2 SAW sensor is 1% CO2 concentration, with 0.0036% frequency change. Wireless module was tested and showed promising transmission distance at preferred parallel orientation.
Fabrication and characteristics of a PECVD SiC evanescent wave optical sensor
 This work presents a simple evanescent wave-sensing system based on plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) silicon carbide (SiC) waveguides. Thin SiC films were deposited on Si substrates with a SiO2 film acting as a cladding layer around the carbide core. In the sensor, the evanescent tale of the light travelling in a waveguide senses an absorbant medium placed above the waveguide. By using a 1 × 2 power splitter, the sensor is calibrated using one arm as a reference. This shows that the sensitivity of such a sensor is improved by choosing SiC as waveguide material compared to silicon nitride (SiN) films.
Excitation and sensing of multiple vibrating traveling waves in one-dimensional structures
 Lightly damped vibrating structures normally exhibit vibration patterns that are a combination of standing waves, i.e. mode shapes. Traveling waves, on the other hand, occur only under special circumstances. In this work, the theoretical conditions under which traveling waves prevail in finite structure are investigated. These conditions are highly sensitive to the geometrical and material parameters of the structure and in particular the vibration pattern is sensitive to the boundary conditions. There are several combinations under which traveling waves cannot be formed and these ill-posed cases are analyzed in some detail. To overcome the unavoidable uncertainties in a model, a tuning process based on identification and optimization of the excitation is suggested. The identification process uses a parametric algorithm to estimate the wavenumbers of the measured vibrations. Then, the waves are decomposed into traveling and standing parts and the external excitation is tuned until a pure traveling wave is formed.
Double warning thresholds for preemptive charging scheduling in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks
 Wireless power transfer technique provides new alternatives for solving the limited power capacity problem for ubiquitous mobile wireless devices, and makes wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) promising. However, mainly due to the underestimate of unbalanced influences of spatial and temporal constraints posed by charging requests, traditional scheduling strategies achieve rather low charging request throughput and success rate, posing as a major bottleneck for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a Double Warning thresholds with Double Preemption (DWDP) charging scheme, in which double warning thresholds are used when residual energy levels of sensor nodes fall below certain thresholds. By introducing specific comparison rules, warning thresholds can be used to adjust charging priorities of different sensors, warn the upcoming recharge deadlines, as well as support preemptive scheduling. Then DWDP is extended to where multiple Wireless Charging Vehicles (WCVs) are employed, and a Collaborative Charging DWDP, namely CCDWDP is proposed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to manifest the advantages of DWDP as well as CCDWDP. Simulation results reveal that DWDP can achieve better performance in guaranteeing the successful scheduling of the high-priority task and improving stability of the system. CCDWDP outperforms in terms of high charging throughput and short charging delay.
Guided wave propagation and scattering for structural health monitoring of stiffened composites
 Impact induced damages in stiffened composite structures are usually settled with constrained design criteria and recurring maintenance tasks, that affect weight savings potentialities of composite materials as well as operative costs. To overcome those penalties due to hidden damages, this paper deals with detection, localization and size assessment of stringers disbondings with monitoring techniques by permanently attached piezoelectric transducers (PZT) capable to excite and sense guided ultrasonic waves. A composite stiffened plate typically designed for wingbox structures is investigated to test a novel detection technique capable to predict arrival time of guided waves scattered from stringers detecting, as a consequence, any possible change in a specific scattering area. Theoretical aspects are investigated to correctly exploit the technique leading to a geometrical reduction which returns the optimal configuration of sensors. Several measurements are carried out to validate the hypothesis and the approach effectiveness. A promising result in agreement with state-of-the-art ultrasonic nondestructive testing is thus obtained and discussed. Furthermore it is shown that processing Lamb wave reflections signals is possible to improve the localization accuracy respect to a general purpose reconstruction algorithm while making use of fewer number of sensors possible.
The effects of oblique waves and currents on the loadings and performance of tidal turbines
 Tidal energy exploitation is at an early deployment stage and costs need to be reduced to improve the long term economic viability of the sector. High costs of tidal turbines are, in part, the result of load uncertainties, which lead to the use of high factors of safety in the design to ensure survival. One of the most important causes of uncertainty is hydrodynamic loadings. To date, most of the scaled model experiments with horizontal axis turbines investigating this issue have been carried out with collinear wave and current directions. To the authors' knowledge, the work presented herein is the first experimental investigation of a horizontal axis turbine model subjected to combined oblique waves and current. Turbine performance and loading are measured for a 1:15 scale model tested in the FloWave circular, combined wave and current basin at the University of Edinburgh (UK). Three different flow directions were tested and each of them were also combined with regular waves in three different directions non-collinear with the flow. Fifteen physical quantities were measured including flow velocity, rotor and foundation loads and turbine speed. Characterisation of loads and turbine performance in those oblique current and wave conditions are presented. Waves affect means and standard deviation of rotor power and thrust, but off-axis waves are associated with lower thrust loads than head-on waves. Compared to current only, rotor torque and thrust standard deviations are higher in the presence of waves and almost twice as high when the wave crest is parallel to the rotor plan.

Transverse magnetic mode slab waveguide optical sensor in the presence of conducting interfaces
 In this paper, three –layer slab waveguide is considered for the p-polarization whose free charge layer with a surface conductivity is assumed to exist at the two interfaces. The structure is then enhanced for sensing process by considering the different refractive index analytes in its proposed cladding structures. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor is investigated in details. Positive as well as negative surface conductivities are considered. It is found that utilizing negative surface conductivity at the interfaces can significantly enhance the sensitivity.
An angle displacement sensor using a simple gear
 This paper presents an angle displacement sensor that consisting of a specified gear, permanent magnets, pairs of tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) magnetic sensors, and a shaft. The shaft and the gear fixed on it move together with the object under measurement. TMR magnetic sensors with the permanent magnet behind it are placed beside the gear. The gear is made up with high magnetic permeability, which constitutes the magnetic circuit with the permanent magnet. With the rotation of the gear, an alternating magnetic field with displacement information is generated. Pairs of TMR sensors separated by 90° electrically angle and applied with sine and cosine voltages respectively are used to perceive the changing magnetic field. So, the angle displacement detection can be realized by analyzing the output signals of TMR sensors. That is, the phase shift of the signals is proportional to the displacement and the phase detection can be realized by serve high frequency time pulses as standard. Thus, the displacement is measured by counting the time pulses. Finite element stimulation and experiment are performed using a prototype of the angular sensor. The proposed scheme is proven to be feasible. The proposed angle displacement sensor can reach up to ±5″ stability with 0.1° resolution.
Fiber sensor for non-contact estimation of vital bio-signs
 Continuous noninvasive measurement of vital bio-signs, such as cardiopulmonary parameters, is an important tool in evaluation of the patient's physiological condition and health monitoring. On the demand of new enabling technologies, some works have been done in arterial pulse monitoring using optical fiber sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel device based on single mode in-fibers Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to detect heartbeat, respiration and pulse wave velocity (PWV). The introduced interferometer is based on a new implanted scheme. It replaces the conventional MZI realized by inserting of discontinuities in the fiber to break the total internal reflection and scatter/collect light. The proposed fiber sensor was successfully incorporated into shirt to produce smart clothing. The measurements obtained from the smart clothing could be obtained in comfortable manner and there is no need to have an initial calibration or a direct contact between the sensor and the skin of the tested individual.
Continuous separation of viable cells by travelling wave dielectrophoresis
 In this contribution we present a label-free continuous separation device for suspended-grown biological cells based on travelling wave dielectrophoresis (twDEP). Suspended-grown cells could otherwise only be separated by flow-cytometry which requires elaborate labelling steps. The biochip consists of a structured PDMS layer on glass in which the channels have been defined. Parallel electrodes positioned along the microfluidic channel were used to expose selected cells to a twDEP force perpendicular to a pressure driven flow. With this device we have successfully separated suspended-grown viable Jurkat (T-cell leukaemia) cells from a mix also containing non-viable cells and L. casei bacteria.
Detection of high-order Lamb waves using an end-face injection of ultrasonic pulses
 In this work, we report the time-of-flight detection of high-order Lamb waves by using an end-face injection of ultrasonic pulses in plates. We used two piezoelectric transducers attached to the opposite edges of a rectangular plate. We applied the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to determine the time-of-flight. We compare the contours of the STFT on the time-frequency spectrogram with the theoretical time-of-flight. This technique defines a broadband map for multiple Lamb waves on the same experimental run. We have found clear evidence not only of the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric modes (S0 and A0) but also of higher order modes (S1,A1, and S2).
Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene Oxide Applications in Optochemical Sensors
 Simple and sensitive ethanol sensors based on uncladded plastic optical fiber (UCPOF) and tapered silica fiber coated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene oxide (GO) thin films have been developed for detecting different ethanol concentrations at room temperature. Simple and low-cost techniques were used for the fabrication of the proposed optical fiber sensors. The developed probes were coated with CNT and GO using drop-casting and dip-coating techniques. Experiments demonstrated that the CNT-based UCPOF and GO-based tapered fiber tip sensors show significant sensitivity to aqueous ethanol with superior selectivity to ethanol among different organic compounds. CNT-based UCPOF sensor shows better sensing performance compared with the GO-based tapered fiber because of the absorbance sensing mechanism. The excellent sensing performance of the developed modified optical fiber sensors toward ethanol indicates their high efficiency to be used in practical applications for ensuring safety necessities in the industrial fields.
A real time forecasting tool for dynamic travel time from clustered time series
 This paper addresses the problem of dynamic travel time (DTT) forecasting within highway traffic networks using speed measurements. Definitions, computational details and properties in the construction of DTT are provided. DTT is dynamically clustered using a K-means algorithm and then information on the level and the trend of the centroid of the clusters is used to devise a predictor computationally simple to be implemented. To take into account the lack of information in the cluster assignment for the new predicted values, a weighted average fusion based on a similarity measurement is proposed to combine the predictions of each model. The algorithm is deployed in a real time application and the performance is evaluated using real traffic data from the South Ring of the Grenoble city in France.
Wave focalization in a wave tank by using time reversal technique
 Offshore structures design and validation currently involves complex numerical simulations and experimental verifications using reduced models. These experiments are usually conducted in ocean wave tanks. The wave focalization using time reversal is a well-known technique in the field of acoustics. It was proved using several physical waves, but was not experimentally tested in ocean wave in the scale of a wave tank. For this purpose, the tank of the University of São Paulo was used for these experiments. The tank has 148 flaps equipped with wave probes for control feedback of active wave absorption. Hence, the waves can be recorded and re-emitted by the flaps. The time reversal technique is here experimentally evaluated in order to generate focused waves in water tests. First, a small object dropping into the tank water acts as a source of impulsive wave for time reversal experiments. In a second experiment, a reflective wall is introduced into the tank, in order to distort the wave propagation and generate wave reverberations. The results show the ability of the time reversal technique to focalize impulsive waves back at the origin, even in the case of obstacles to the wave propagation.
Continuous high-performance drive of rotary traveling-wave ultrasonic motor with water cooling
 It is known that rotary traveling-wave ultrasonic motors (RTUSMs) have several inherent advantages over conventional electromagnetic motors. However, the practical applications of RTUSMs are limited in the field of transitory servo drive. The underlying reason is that the temperature rise caused by internal losses has a significant influence on the motor characteristics, which gives rise to substantial performance degradation and poor operational reliability. To explore the feasibility of RTUSMs in the applications of continuous motion drive, we propose to maintain the output performance by directly suppressing the working temperature rise. Based on convective heat transfer, a water-cooling motor base was designed to remove heat from the stator. The motor base was fabricated by embedding a simple pipeline structure and connected to a commercial PC water-cooling radiator. The experimental results show that the RTUSM60 motor maintains an output power of 3.3 W and a temperature rise of 22 °C during 48-h continuous operation with water cooling. Due to the effective suppression of temperature rise, the motor can work with a stable output power of 2.35 W even under the load torque of 0.9 N m.
A scalable design of experiments framework for optimal sensor placement
 We present a scalable design of an experiments framework for sensor placement in systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we aim to compute optimal sensor locations by minimizing the uncertainty of parameters estimated from Bayesian inverse problems. The resulting problem is a computationally intractable mixed-integer nonlinear program constrained by PDEs. We approach this problem with two heuristics used in compressed sensing and optimal control literature: a sparsity-inducing approach and a sum-up rounding approach. We also investigate metrics to guide the design of experiments (the total flow variance and the A-optimal design criterion) and analyze the effect of different noise structures (white and colored). Using an application in natural gas pipelines, we conclude that the sum-up rounding approach gives the best results and produces shrinking gaps with increasing mesh resolution. We also observe that convergence for the white noise measurement error case is slower than for the colored noise case. For A-optimal design, the solution is close to a uniform distribution of sensors along the pipeline while for the flow variance design the distribution is unstructured.
Surface acoustic wave based H2S gas sensors incorporating sensitive layers of single wall carbon nanotubes decorated with Cu nanoparticles
 This paper presents a surface acoustic wave (SAW) based H2S gas sensor with excellent selectivity and recovery/response time developed using single wall carbon nanotube decorated with copper nanoparticles (Cu NP-SWCNT). A thin film of Cu NP-SWCNT was deposited onto a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) piezoelectric substrate via a drop-casting technique. Sensing of H2S gas was carried out by measuring acoustoelectric perturbation of SAWs traveling along the LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate and Cu NP-SWCNT sensing layer. H2S gas of concentrations as small as 5 ppm could be readily measured. The effect of temperature on the SAW sensor response was also investigated for a range of temperatures from 70 to 200 °C. The optimum operating temperature was 175 °C, in which, a relatively rapid response (7 s) and recovery time (9 s) was recorded. The selectivity of the proposed Cu NP-SWCNT gas sensor was examined by assessing the sensor response upon exposure to hydrogen, acetone, ethanol, and H2S gas species in air background and a large selectivity toward H2S gas was observed.
The role of internal waves in the late Quaternary evolution of the Israeli continental slope
 Internal waves are widely present in world's oceans propagating in stratified ocean layers such as the seasonal pycnocline. At continental shelves and slopes, breaking of internal waves may create turbulence of sufficient energy to erode and transport sediments. In this study, we investigate the late Pleistocene to Recent impact of internal waves on the morphology of the Israeli Mediterranean continental slope. Based on mooring data, we show that the internal wave spectrum on the upper slope contains significant energy at near-inertial and semidiurnal tidal frequencies. Sediment subbottom profiler data show two fields of nearly contour parallel sediment waves located in water depths of 80 m–130 m and 190 m–350 m, respectively. A zone of flat seafloor morphology and remarkably constant slope inclination of 1.0°–1.2° separates both sediment wave fields. The entire stretch of seafloor between 80 m and 350 m corresponds to depths of major ocean density stratification, supporting the propagation of internal waves. In addition, this area is critically inclined with respect to semidiurnal internal tides and supercritically inclined with respect to near-inertial waves, two scenarios previously related to internal wave breaking. We propose that breaking internal waves control the inclination of the Israeli continental slope and contribute to sediment starvation within the zone of flat seafloor morphology. The formation of sediment waves is attributed to high-frequency trailing internal waves of similar wavelengths as sediment waves, observed within a seismic image of the water column. We correlate subbottom profiler data to a radiocarbon dated sediment core. No sediment waves formed from 16 cal ka–8 cal ka, indicating that the seafloor impact of internal waves ceased during a time of rapid sea level rise and fresh water input in the Eastern Mediterranean realm. The end of this period coincides with the formation of sapropel S1.
A finite volume method and experimental study of a stator of a piezoelectric traveling wave rotary ultrasonic motor
 Piezoelectric traveling wave rotary ultrasonic motors are motors that generate torque by using the friction force between a piezoelectric composite ring (or disk-shaped stator) and a metallic ring (or disk-shaped rotor) when a traveling wave is excited in the stator. The motor speed is proportional to the amplitude of the traveling wave and, in order to obtain large amplitudes, the stator is excited at frequencies close to its resonance frequency. This paper presents a non-empirical partial differential equations model for the stator, which is discretized using the finite volume method. The fundamental frequency of the discretized model is computed and compared to the experimentally-measured operating frequency of the stator of Shinsei USR60 piezoelectric motor.
Application of ultrasonic waves towards the inspection of similar and dissimilar friction stir welded joints
 Crack detection in welded structures of dissimilar material using guided waves is not well developed. This paper scrutinizes the effect of material discontinuity in plate structures and the excessive plastic deformation, within friction stir welded (FSW) joints, on the propagation behavior of guided waves toward their application in weld assessment. Quantifying the scattering, attenuation and group velocities of the guided waves when they propagate across different media, as well as determining the elastic properties of the material within the weld will provide rich information about the behavior of ultrasonic waves. Three pristine defect free friction stir welded plates were used in this study. The first specimen was a weld of dissimilar materials aluminum/magnesium alloy (AA6061-T6/AZ31B), the second was of dissimilar aluminum alloy grades (AA6060/AA7020-T651), and the third was of the same aluminum grade (AA7020-T651/AA7020-T651). The elastic properties across all the welds were extrapolated using nano-indentation technique. Ultrasonic guided waves were excited and measured using piezoelectric wafers and laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Additionally, a sensor network design was implemented on the three specimens using piezoelectric transducers. Wave reflections, based on the LDV results and the information collected from the sensor network, were observed at the weld zone of the AA6061-T6/AZ31B FSW plate, while no reflections were detected at the weld zones in the AA7020-T651/AA7020-T651 and AA6060/AA7020-T651 plates. The results were correlated with the measurements obtained from the nano-indentation experiment, where a sharp change in the elastic properties of the base metals in the AA6061-T6/AZ31B welded joint were detected, unlike the other two plates that showed constant elastic properties across the weld zones. The results showed that the amount of scattering at the joints is a function of the wave propagation direction. It was noticed that the average wave reflection generated when the wave crossed from the AZ31B to the AA6061-T6 base metal was around 35% of the incident signal, but it reduced to 25% when the wave propagation direction was reversed. Characterizing ultrasonic waves in FSWs and the behavior of the incident and reflected waves in the welded zones will further improve on the technology used for inspection and monitoring of solid state welded joints.
Investigation of the response of high-bandwidth MOX sensors to gas plumes for application on a mobile robot in hazardous environments
 A custom sensor module has been developed comprising high-bandwidth metal oxide (MOX), low-cost non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) and miniature solidly mounted resonator (SMR) acoustic sensors for use on a mobile exploration robot. The module has been tested in a wind tunnel in order to evaluate the performance of three MOX sensors (with coatings of PdPt SnO2, WO3 and NiO) to plumes of 2-propanol (concentration < 2.5 ppm). The formation of the VOC (volatile organic compound) plumes was verified through mapping of sensor responses across a grid of 9 positions in the wind tunnel. Fluctuating sensor responses were observed (±5%), demonstrating variation of VOC concentration within the gas plumes. Higher sensor responses were demonstrated with the n-type SnO2 and WO3 based devices (80% and 40% change relative to baseline, respectively) compared to the p-type NiO device (10%). Short plumes of VOC demonstrated the effect of gas pulse broadening, where longer duration responses (10% greater) were observed at locations further from the VOC source (∼0.4 m distance variation tested). Finally, the module was tested in a real-world environment, where plumes of VOC were observed using the MOX sensors and verified using a commercial Photoionization Detector (PID).
Wave resource characterization through in-situ measurement followed by artificial neural networks' modeling
 This research presents a mathematical model that uses artificial neural networks for the assessment of the wave energy potential of sites, based on data recorded by wave monitoring instrumentation. The model was implemented and validated in two different sites. The first one had a dataset from an upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler that recorded a hindcast during 2½ years. The second consisted in data from a buoy using motion sensors that recorded continuously during 23 years. For this second site, the performance of the neural network model was compared to that of the Nearshore Wave Prediction System (NWPS), which combines SWAN, Wavewatch III and other numerical models. For the 2½ years' hindcast, the error of the neural network was significant which suggests a better use for filling missing gaps within datasets than for resource assessment. Meanwhile the performance of the neural network trained with the 23 years' hindcast was satisfactory; better than the NWPS in terms of relative bias but worse in terms of scatter index. Therefore it is concluded that neural networks can make an optimal use of the data produced by wave monitoring instrumentation and are useful to characterize the wave energy resource of a coastal site.
Propagation of p-polarized light in photonic crystal for sensor application
 In this work, a comprehensive analytical study is presented on two-layer one- dimensional photonic crystal in which the first layer is considered to be an analyte layer and the second layer is assumed be left-handed material (LHM), dielectric or metal. The dispersion relation is derived for p- polarized wave (TM). The sensitivity of the effective index to any change in the analyte index is derived, plotted and analyzed. Our optimization shows that it is possible for photonic crystal sensor to achieve a sensitivity improvement of 714% compared to conventional waveguide sensor.
Experimental investigation on the surface wave characteristics of conical liquid film
 The disintegration of the liquid sheet is due to the growth of the unstable surface wave. Research on the surface wave characteristics mainly uses the linear stability analysis, and the surface wave characteristics, for example the frequency and wave length of the surface wave, have not been analyzed well experimentally. In the present study, the proper orthogonal decomposition is adopted to analyze the instantaneous spray images and the extracted surface waves on the interface of the gas and liquid. The wavelength and frequency of the surface wave are obtained, and the influence of the injector mass flow rate is investigated. The results show that the spray pattern moves from onion stage to tulip stage and fully developed wavy cone stage with the increase of liquid mass flow rate. In the tulip stage, the wave frequency decreases slightly and then increases with the increase of liquid mass flow rate. On the contrary, the wavelength increases gradually with the increase of liquid mass flow rate and then decreases slightly. This variation trend is caused by the competition effect of the film thickness and the axial film velocity. The decrease of film thickness decreases the wave frequency and increases the wavelength, while the increase of the axial film velocity increases the wave frequency and decreases the wavelength. In the fully developed wavy cone stage, the wave frequency increases gradually with the increase of liquid mass flow rate. And the bandwidth of the surface wave frequency increases gradually, which means that the leading role of the dominant surface wave is weakened and the conical film is dominated by surface waves with multiple frequencies. The wavelength decreases with the increase of liquid mass flow rate because of the significant increased axial film velocity.
Whispering-gallery modes in a triple-layer-coated microsphere resonator for refractive index sensors
 In this study, a highly sensitive refractive index (RI) sensor is designed by functionally coating three layers of high, low, and high RI from inside to outside on the external surface of an optical microsphere resonator. The properties of whispering-gallery modes, confined in normal microspheres, as well as triple-layer-coated microspheres are presented theoretically and numerically through electromagnetic analyses. The whispering-gallery modes in such a triple-layer-coated microsphere resonator are found to be efficiently excited when optimizing the gap between the microsphere and waveguide. Two cladding modes, referred to as the inner mode (IM) and outer mode (OM), are exhibited in two high-RI layers. Potential RI-sensing applications stemming from the coupling for the IM and OM are investigated thereafter using the perturbation theory and the finite difference time domain method. It is found that the sensing properties of the OM can exceed single-layer-coated microspheres in terms of sensitivity. Specifically, an increased sensitivity of 49.5 nm/RIU (Refractive Index Unit) can be achieved by tailoring the film thickness of the middle low-RI layer. When applying a thick coating in the middle layer, there is a mode bonding in the sensitivity for the IM and OM. The detection limit, or quality factor, is also investigated by using an approximate theory. Results demonstrate that it is possible to reach a detection limit with a variation of ∼10−6. The study’s theoretical and numerical predictions provide guidelines for the improved design and fabrication of microsphere RI sensors.
Synthesis, growth and characterization of ZnO microtubes using a traveling-wave mode microwave system
 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) investigation reveals that zinc oxide (ZnO) microtubes have been successfully synthesized via a traveling-wave mode microwave system. These products are hexagonal tubular crystals with an average diameter of 60 μm and 250 μm in length, having a well faceted end and side surfaces. The wall thickness of the ZnO tubes is about 3–5 μm. The influence of reaction temperature on the formation of crystalline ZnO hexagonal tubes is studied. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra have also been examined to explore the optical property which exhibits strong ultraviolet emission at 377.422 nm and a weak and broad green emission band at 587.548 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) show that the product is composed only of ZnO with high crystallinity. The presented synthesis method possesses several advantages, which would be significant to the deeper study and wide applications of ZnO tubes in the future.
Investigation on traveling wave thermoacoustic heat engine with high pressure amplitude
 As the thermoacoustic conversion process occurring in its regenerator is considered reversible, a traveling wave thermoacoustic engine can theoretically produce and transmit acoustic power with high efficiency. A large scale multifunction thermoacoustic engine has been designed, constructed and tested. Compared with the results of standing wave thermoacoustic heat engines, the experimental results show the engine has a lower onset temperature, much higher pressure ratio and higher efficiency. With the filling nitrogen of 0.9 MPa, the maximal pressure ratio reached 1.21, and the operation frequency was steady at 25 Hz. The single stage U type orifice pulse tube cooler driven by the engine reached 153.7 K when the working pressure was 1.5 MPa.
Absorbance Spectroscopy for Chemical Sensors☆
 This article focuses on chemical sensors that are based on absorbance spectroscopy. These sensors exploit the principles of a widely used optical method for chemical analysis, involving the property of a chemical species to absorb light and diminish the intensity of the probing radiation. These sensors integrate the various components of the conventional instrumentation into a miniature system, and simplify the measurement process for a large number of chemical species. The various measurement modes and instrumentation components are presented and discussed, and some examples are described.
Triaxial apparatus equipped with elastic waves and matric suction measurement techniques
 A recently developed technique for elastic wave measurement, a disk transducer method, and a pressure membrane technique for suction measurement were merged into a modified triaxial testing apparatus enabling the procurement of both the elastic waves and the matric suction of a cylindrical specimen. The apparatus was employed to evaluate the variation in suction in sandy soil possessing a low range of suction (less than 100 kPa). Fine sand with two types of fines, namely, non-plastic silt and kaolin clay, was mixed with Toyoura sand in order to prepare sandy soil specimens. Both compressional and shear wave velocities were evaluated in conjunction with the associated matric suction. The matric suction was varied by injecting water into the specimens, and the relevant elastic wave velocities were obtained by a disk transducer. This research has corroborated the applicability of the disk transducer method to unsaturated soil specimens as well as the effects of matric suction on the mechanical behaviour of sandy soils possessing a low range of suction.
Experimental and numerical investigation on wave height and power take–off damping effects on the hydrodynamic performance of an offshore–stationary OWC wave energy converter
 Wave energy is a viable source of ocean renewable energy and research is being conducted worldwide. The Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device is recognised internationally as one of the most promising types of ocean Wave Energy Converters (WECs). To effectively utilize ocean waves for harvesting more energy, offshore OWC devices need to be deployed in deep–water where waves are more energetic. Therefore, the present paper experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a 3D offshore–stationary OWC device subjected to a wide range of regular wave conditions of different periods and heights and nonlinear power take–off (PTO) damping conditions simulated by an orifice. The experimental results were also employed to validate a 3D incompressible Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model based on the RANS–VOF approach. It was found that the device capture width ratio decreased as wave height increased, especially for wave frequencies higher than device resonance frequency. However, for low–frequency waves under small PTO damping, there was a noticeable improvement in the device capture width ratio. More importantly, results of this study revealed that even with the changes in the device capture width ratio as wave height doubled, the OWC device could extract more wave energy throughout the whole frequency range tested by a maximum of about 7.7 times, particularly for long waves under small PTO damping. Furthermore, the numerical results from the 3D CFD model were in good agreement with the experiments, while the 2D model provided misleading (overestimating) results for high–frequency waves.
Acoustic source localization in anisotropic plates with “Z” shaped sensor clusters
 A new sensor cluster orientation is proposed to localize an acoustic source in a plate from the time difference of arrival (TDOA) with the help of only four to eight sensors. This technique requires neither a priori knowledge of the plate material properties nor a dense array of sensors to localize the acoustic source in isotropic as well as anisotropic plates. It is achieved by placing four sensors in a cluster in the shape of letter “Z” over a small region of the plate and a second Z-shaped cluster at another location of the plate. Experimental results show that it is possible to accurately localize the acoustic source with this new configuration. It reduces the number of sensors required for acoustic source localization in an anisotropic plate. Although one cluster in principle is capable of localizing the acoustic source in absence of any experimental error for accurate source localization in presence of experimental error two such Z-shaped clusters are needed. In the currently available technique three L-shaped clusters having a total of 9 sensors are needed to achieve the same level of confidence in the acoustic source localization. Thus, the proposed new technique reduces the number of sensors by 1 (from 9 to 8) for confidently and accurately predicting the acoustic source.
Torsional wave in a circular micro-tube with clogging attached to the inner surface
 In the present paper, we study the torsional wave propagation along a micro-tube with clogging attached to its inner surface. The clogging accumulated on the inner surface of the tube is modeled as an “elastic membrane” which is described by the so-called surface elasticity. A power-series solution is particularly developed for the lowest order of wave propagation. The dispersion diagram of the lowest-order wave is numerically presented with the surface (clogging) effect.
Operating characteristics and performance improvements of a 500 W traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator
 Traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator has drawn increasing attention due to its great prospect in energy conversion. In this work, a traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator capable of generating about 500 W electric power is studied numerically and experimentally. The performances and the operating characteristics of the system under different working conditions are tested and analyzed. The maximum electric powers can be obtained with electric load resistance around 100–120 Ω, and the highest thermal-to-electric efficiencies can be achieved at much larger load resistances. The efficiency at low load resistance is relatively small due to the large pressure amplitudes inside the thermoacoustic system, which increases the dissipations. The variation trends of the electric power and the thermal-to-electric efficiency with the load resistance intrinsically result from the changes of the corresponding acoustic impedance of the linear alternators, which determines the output performance of the thermoacoustic engine meanwhile. The distributions of the acoustic power losses are then calculated and firstly illustrated quantitatively. It is shown that the resonator causes most of the acoustic power losses, and the losses in hot heat exchanger, thermal buffer tube, and feedback tube are also significant. The output performance of the system can be improved by increasing the heating temperature and the mean pressure. A maximum electric power of 473.6 W and a highest thermal-to-electric efficiency of 14.5% are achieved experimentally when the mean pressure is 2.48 MPa and the heating temperature is 650 °C. A pair of linear alternators with a larger swept volume and appropriate acoustic impedances is finally designed to couple with the thermoacoustic torus directly. Numerical results show that the maximum electric power can be increased to 718 W and 1005 W when the mean pressures are kept at 2.48 MPa and 3.20 MPa, corresponding to the improvements of 42.6% and 29.4% compared with those of the original system.
Thermoacoustic heat pumping direction alteration by variation of magnitude and phase difference of opposing acoustic waves
 Thermoacoustic refrigeration utilizes the temperature changes that occur due to pressure oscillations within a sound wave to transport heat from one point to another and achieve cooling. As such, it neither requires complicated machinery nor hazardous or environmentally harmful refrigerants. By altering the acoustic field, it is possible to also alter the direction of heat pumping allowing a single device to be capable of functioning as a heater or cooler without addition of complicated machinery. We have constructed a thermoacoustic heat pump employing dual opposing acoustic drivers or speakers connected by a resonator tube and a regenerator formed by layers of steel mesh positioned at the centre of the resonator to investigate the alteration of the acoustic field due to the interaction of opposing travelling waves. The acoustic field was manipulated by changing the phase difference and magnitude difference between the waves generated by the acoustic drivers. Experimental results show that the acoustic power flow on both sides of the regenerator was altered thus resulting in a change in heat pumping direction along the regenerator. In addition, it was also observed that the heat pumping was also influenced by the changes in the standing wave component (SWC) and the travelling wave component (TWC).
Peregrine breathers as design waves for wave-structure interaction
 This paper introduces the Peregrine breather solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger-type equation as an innovative design wave. The major benefits are the potential to generate abnormal waves of certain frequency up to physically possible wave heights, the symmetrical abnormal wave shape and the availability of an analytical solution. The characteristics of Peregrine breathers as well as their impact on marine structures were investigated. To evaluate the applicability of the Peregrine breather solution as design wave, wave-structure investigations with a LNG carrier were performed in a set of Peregrine breathers at certain frequencies. The investigations comprised model tests as well as numerical simulations. For the purpose of comparison, a real-world abnormal wave reproduction was additionally investigated allowing the evaluation of breather-type abnormal waves regarding the applicability as design wave. Therefore, the famous ‘New Year Wave’, an abnormal wave recorded in the North Sea at the Draupner jacket platform on January 1st, 1995, was selected.
TERRAPOWER, LLC TRAVELING WAVE REACTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW
 Energy security is a topic of high importance to many countries throughout the world. Countries with access to vast energy supplies enjoy all of the economic and political benefits that come with controlling a highly sought after commodity. Given the desire to diversify away from fossil fuels due to rising environmental and economic concerns, there are limited technology options available for baseload electricity generation. Further complicating this issue is the desire for energy sources to be sustainable and globally scalable in addition to being economic and environmentally benign. Nuclear energy in its current form meets many but not all of these attributes. In order to address these limitations, TerraPower, LLC has developed the Traveling Wave Reactor (TWR) which is a near-term deployable and truly sustainable energy solution that is globally scalable for the indefinite future. The fast neutron spectrum allows up to a ∼30-fold gain in fuel utilization efficiency when compared to conventional light water reactors utilizing enriched fuel. When compared to other fast reactors, TWRs represent the lowest cost alternative to enjoy the energy security benefits of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle without the associated proliferation concerns of chemical reprocessing. On a country level, this represents a significant savings in the energy generation infrastructure for several reasons 1) no reprocessing plants need to be built, 2) a reduced number of enrichment plants need to be built, 3) reduced waste production results in a lower repository capacity requirement and reduced waste transportation costs and 4) less uranium ore needs to be mined or purchased since natural or depleted uranium can be used directly as fuel. With advanced technological development and added cost, TWRs are also capable of reusing both their own used fuel and used fuel from LWRs, thereby eliminating the need for enrichment in the longer term and reducing the overall societal waste burden. This paper describes the origins and current status of the TWR development program at TerraPower, LLC. Some of the areas covered include the key TWR design challenges and brief descriptions of TWR-Prototype (TWR-P) reactor. Selected information on the TWR-P core designs are also provided in the areas of neutronic, thermal hydraulic and fuel performance. The TWR-P plant design is also described in such areas as; system design descriptions, mechanical design, and safety performance.
Stochastic travel demand estimation: Improving network identifiability using multi-day observation sets
 Stochastic travel demand estimation is essential to support many resilience and reliability based transportation network analyses. The problem of estimating travel demand based on sensor data often results in an ill-posed inverse problem, where solution uniqueness cannot be ensured. To overcome this challenge, effective utilization of more information/data, preferably from reliable sources, becomes critical. Conventional demand estimation methods often sacrifice system structural information during the process of compressing sensor data into its statistics. Loss of structural information, which captures critical relation between observed and estimated parameters, inevitably causes more dependence on unrealistic assumptions and unreliable data. Our model is designed to preserve all structural information contained from different observation sets and allow it to directly contribute to the identification of population parameters of travel demand. The proposed hierarchical framework integrates two traditionally distinctive identification problems, mean demand estimation and trip table reconstruction. Through mathematical analyses and numerical experiments, we show that the proposed framework improves parameter identifiability and leads to better estimation quality compared to conventional methods. The proposed framework is also flexible to accommodate a wide variety of travel behavior assumptions and estimation principles. As an example among many possible alternatives, Wardrop equilibrium based traffic assignment and generalized least square are implemented and tested using a case study based on a moderately large network.
Travelling-wave-sustained discharges
 This review is on discharges maintained by travelling waves: new plasma sources, discovered in 1974 and considered as a prototype of the gas discharges according to their definition as nonlinear systems which unify in a self-consistent manner plasmas and fields. In the presentation here of the fluid-plasma models of the diffusion-controlled regime of the travelling-wave-sustained discharges (TWSDs), the basic features of the discharge maintenance—the discharge self-consistency and the electron heating in the high-frequency field—are stressed. Operation of stationary and pulsed discharges, discharge maintenance without and in external magnetic fields as well as discharge production in different gases (argon, helium, helium–argon gas mixtures and hydrogen) are covered. Modulation instability of diffusion-controlled discharges and discharge filamentation at higher gas pressures are also included in the review. Experimental findings which motivate aspects of the reported modelling are pointed out.
LTL type nanozeolites utilized in surface photonics structures for environmental sensors
 Environmental monitoring has been continuously increasing due to an emerging global emphasis on the importance of sustainable development. Improving water quality monitoring and control is a challenge that calls for innovative solutions. Current methods of water monitoring are costly and analytical techniques suitable for field use are limited. There is a need for accurate, long–term monitoring of environmental contaminants using sensors that can be operated on site. The aim of our research is to theoretically model, fabricate and characterise holographic sensors for water quality monitoring that are simple to operate, capable of sensing copper present in fresh water and have relatively low cost. The sensors are created by holographic recording of surface relief gratings (SRG) in a self-processing photopolymer material. Interrogation of these structures by light allows indirect measurements of ion concentration in real time. The SRG structures are modified by coating with porous LTL-nanoparticles (nanosized zeolites) which selectively adsorb copper ions. The suitability of the sensors for detection of copper (II) present in water at concentration levels 1–4 mM is reported. The current detection limit of the sensor is 63 ppm.
Design and fabrication of a new traveling wave-type ultrasonic linear motor
 This paper describes the development of a new traveling wave-type ultrasonic linear motor. The motor consists of a metallic stator and two piezoelectric ceramic plates bonded to the stator, thereby eliminating the need for external vibrators. The two piezoceramic plates excite two ultrasonic standing waves with a certain phase difference, which convert to a traveling wave when combined together. The operation principle of the motor is presented along with the theoretical equations, and the feasibility is verified using the finite element method. Based on the finite element analyses, detailed dimensions and boundary conditions are determined for the proper generation of a traveling wave. Experimental fabrication and characterization of a sample motor is performed to confirm the numerical results and prove the practical applicability of the new structure. The new linear motor presented in this work offers a relatively simple structure compared to traditional traveling wave-types while maintaining all the characteristic features of an ultrasonic motor.
The dispersion and attenuation of the multi-physical fields coupled waves in a piezoelectric semiconductor
 The dispersion and attenuation features of the multi-physical fields coupled waves propagating in an infinite piezoelectric semiconductor and the reflection problem at a boundary which is mechanically free, electrically insulation and the dielectrically open circuit are studied in this paper. Different from the classic dielectric piezoelectric medium, there are four kinds of coupled elastic waves, i.e. the quasi-longitudinal wave (QP), the quasi-traverse wave (QSV), the electric–acoustic wave (EA) and the electron or hole carriers wave (CP), in a piezoelectric semiconductor. The influences of the steady carrier density and biasing electric field upon the dispersion and attenuation features of these coupled elastic waves and the reflection amplitude ratios are studied numerically. The energy flux of each wave and the interaction energy fluxes among all waves are also calculated, and the energy flux balance is checked. It is found that the piezoelectric semiconductor behaves like the viscoelastic solid to carry a decaying wave. The steady carrier density and biasing electric field have significant influences on the dispersion and attenuation features and can be used to regulate the propagation of the coupled elastic waves.
A Review of advancements (2007–2017) in plasmonics-based optical fiber sensors
 The present review summarizes the progress made in the area of plasmonics-based fiber optic sensors during the last decade (2007–2017). The review is in continuation with the previous review focused on the developments made in the above area during the timeframe of almost 25 years (i.e., 1990–2006). In addition, other important reviews are also discussed in order to widen the scope of the work. This work is focused on review of four types of plasmonics-based optical fiber sensors viz., single mode fiber, multimoded fiber, microstructured fiber, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and use of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, MoS2etc. The structures, performance parameters, and results related to some important works have been discussed. Based on the present state-of-the art, the future scope and related fields have been discussed.
Proposed method of partial discharge allocation with acoustic emission sensors within power transformers
 Employing acoustic emission sensors for detection of partial discharge, PD, introduces many advantages. Besides easy installation and replacement, they are non-invasive and immune to electromagnetic noise and interference and their sensitivity does not vary with object capacitance. For PD allocating utilizing AE sensors, distance calculations are based on the arrival time of acoustic waves to the sensors. Considering structure-borne waves of higher speed, the peaks of some of indirect path AE signals with significant contribution are mistakenly considered as peaks of direct path AE signals. Furthermore, the acoustic signals are propagating through certain parts of the transformer, such as the windings, and this complicates the partial discharge detection and allocation. These would imply an incorrect distance between the source and sensor. A method based on a heuristic algorithm has been proposed which considering all possible indirect paths with the relevant propagation times and all the barriers on the travel path of acoustic signal, calculates the more precise arrival times to sensors. A test chamber has been utilized and artificial PD signals are produced at various points. Output results of algorithm have been compared with results of classic method. It has been shown that proposed method significantly reduces the positioning errors.
Autonomous data driven surveillance and rectification system using in-vehicle sensors for intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
 Road safety through vehicular control is the prime interest of research in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). Diagnostic analysis of In-vehicle sensors is one of the core concerns for vehicular safety. There is a number of safety applications promising the features needed in vehicular safety. Therefore, this paper designed, developed, and implemented a solution for diagnostic analysis of In-vehicle sensors with autonomous recovery procedure. An artificial intelligence-based technique is used for monitoring, reporting and autonomous recovering of vehicle sensors. The algorithm used for diagnostic analysis of sensors not only determines the operational state of the sensors but also executes procedure for sensors autonomous recovery. A graphical display depicts the operational state of sensors for driver’s information. Hexadecimal message format is implemented for transmission and reception of sensors data to the central administration unit using Internet Protocol (IP). The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed solution in term of recovery time of faulty sensor.
Characterization of a CMOS sensor array for small field fluence measurement of a low energy proton beam
 Small fields and sharp dose gradients typically encountered in proton irradiation for preclinical research require high spatial resolution dosimetric measurements, especially below 10 mm beam diameter. This study aims to characterize a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor for fluence measurement of small radiation fields (2 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm diameter) delivered by a 25 MeV proton beam dedicated to preclinical irradiations. The beam fluence was characterized in air with a MIMOSA28 CMOS sensor and EBT3 films and compared to Geant4 simulations. The measured flatness for the 10 mm field was found within ±2.5 % with both the CMOS sensor and EBT3 films. Lateral profiles were in agreement within a distance of 0.1 mm between the two detectors and Geant4 simulations. Also, with a fixed particle rate, the fluence measured by the CMOS sensor was constant at the plateau of the Bragg curve, regardless the field size, while EBT3 showed a 10% increased fluence for the 2 mm collimated beam. The CMOS sensor demonstrated a high spatial resolution and its fluence-response is independent of the radiation field sizes that seems promising for future developments in dosimetry of small field proton beams for precise irradiation platforms dedicated to preclinical research, as well as in nuclear research and laser accelerated particle beam characterization
Fiber Optic Lateral Coupling Force Sensor for Biomedical Applications
 In realization of contact force between catheter tip and the tissue is very critical, there is a need to develop compact and sensitive force sensor. Hence, in this study, a novel miniature force sensor comprised of fiber optics and micro-capillaries, based on fiber optic lateral coupling had been designed, simulated, fabricated and evaluated. In this context, two types viz. micro-capillary fiber optic assembly (CAP) micro-cone – anti-cone assembly (CONE) were proposed. FDTD simulation studies were performed on CONE to estimate the spacing between two fiber optics. It was found that the coupling spacing below 1.5 μm is suitable to couple the light. The fabricated CAP was successfully evaluated up to the required applied force i.e. 32 gF for biomedical applications. The observed travel length of micro-capillary over the fiber core was observed to be 189.873μm for the applied force of 32 gF.
Experimental assessment of the influence of welding process parameters on Lamb wave transmission across ultrasonically welded thermoplastic composite joints
 One of the advantages of thermoplastic composites relative to their thermoset counterparts is the possibility of assembling components through welding. Ultrasonic welding in particular is very promising for industrialization. However, uncertainty in the fatigue and fracture behaviour of composites is still an obstacle to the full utilisation of these materials. Health monitoring is then of vital importance, and Lamb wave techniques have been widely recognised as some of the most promising approaches for that end. This paper presents the first experimental study about the influence of welding travel on the transmission of Lamb waves across ultrasonically welded thermoplastic composite joints in single-lap configuration. The main aim of this research is to start to understand how guided waves interact with the internal structure of ultrasonic welds, so that benign, manufacturing-related structural features can be distinguished from damaging ones in signal interpretation. The power transmission coefficient and the correlation coefficient proved to be suitable for analysing the wave propagation phenomena, allowing quantitative identification of small variations of weld-line thickness and intermolecular diffusion at the weld interface. The conclusions are used to develop a tentative damage detection criterion which can later on assist the design of a Lamb wave based structural health monitoring system for thermoplastic composite structures. The Lamb wave test results are backed up by phased-array inspections, which also provide some extra insight on the internal structure of ultrasonic welds.
Reverse time migration of acoustic waves for imaging based defects detection for concrete and CFST structures
 Ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) technology has been widely used for defect inspection of concrete structures in civil engineering. However, most of the current data processing methods can only provide qualitative information regarding the existence of concrete inner defects. In this study, an ultrasonic inner defects inspection approach with a high-resolution imaging method which combines travel time tomography (TTT) and reverse time migration (RTM) is proposed for concrete and concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns. TTT estimates a reasonable distribution of ultrasonic velocity over the cross-section of the concrete and CFST columns from the first arrival time of the ultrasonic transmission signal. The velocity distribution is used as an input of the initial model for RTM to image the defects inside the concrete and CFST column cross-sections with a high resolution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the air cavity inside the concrete and CFST columns, and the debonding between the concrete core and the steel tube of the CFST column can be identified clearly, and that the location, size and shape of both defects can be determined accurately. It is concluded that the proposed defect detection approach with a high-resolution imaging method is efficient for the non-destructive inspection of concrete and CFST structures using ultrasonic waves.
Bottom pressure distribution under a solitonic wave reflecting on a vertical wall
 The bottom pressure distribution under solitonic waves, travelling or fully reflected at a wall is analysed here. Results given by two kind of numerical models are compared. One of the models is based on the Green–Naghdi equations, while the other one is based on the fully nonlinear potential equations. The two models differ through the way in which wave dispersion is taken into account. This approach allows us to emphasize the influence of dispersion, in the case of travelling or fully reflected waves. The Green–Naghdi model is found to predict well the bottom pressure distribution, even when the quantitative representation of the runup height is not satisfactorily described.
Guided ultrasonic waves for detection of debonding in bars partially embedded in grout
 This paper deals with theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations of guided wave propagation in multilayered cylindrical bars with pre-existing debonding. The research focuses on a complex description of the nature of the wave phenomena occurring in a debonded specimen with a special emphasis on the influence of the location of damage on the wave conversion and diffraction. Experimental non-destructive and destructive tests are conducted on the laboratory models of ground anchors with a variable debonding length and location. Debonding is simulated by wrapping the bar in the cellophane film with very small thickness, providing indirect contact between steel and grout but reducing grout adhesion to steel. Guided waves are excited and measured at the free end of the bar with the use of piezo actuators. Characteristic reflections are identified in signals registered for anchors with three locations of debonding and five debonding lengths. The obtained results show that despite of such small thickness of debonding (60 µm), guided waves may be used as an effective method for detection of adhesive debonding at an early stage of its development.
Label-free optofluidic sensor based on polymeric microresonator for the detection of cadmium ions in tap water
 In this article, we report on the specific detection of cadmium ions in water using an optofluidic sensor based on a polymeric microresonator functionalized with a cadmium ion specific ligand. A limit of detection down to (0.31 ± 0.07) nM ((33.9 ± 7.8) ng/L) in deionized water and (0.36 ± 0.10) nM ((38.9 ± 10.6) ng/L) in tap water was achieved. When applying a post-measurement digital treatment onto measured signals using a median filter, the sensor limit of detection was reduced to (0.13 ± 0.03) nM ((14.8 ± 0.07) ng/L) in deionized water and to (0.17 ± 0.04) nM ((18.3 ± 4.4) ng/L) in tap water. The chemical sensor could be adapted to build a portable instrument for in situ analysis.
The feasibility of synthetic aperture guided wave imaging to a mobile sensor platform
 A mobile sensor platform that features a non-contact guided wave piezoelectric composite transducer payload for rapid inspection of large plate-like structures is presented. The paper begins with results from an experimental B-scan of an aluminium plate. Since the current guided wave payload uses 30 mm square transducers (9λ wide) the system provides fairly course lateral resolution that in this case is approximately equal to the width of the transducer. The paper goes on to use simulation tools to examine the practical SNR and resolution limits of this approach. When using narrow aperture transducers that provide a wide field of view it is important to apply the synthetic aperture focusing technique to maximise image resolution. It is shown that resolution is a function of both transducer aperture and robot positional uncertainty since the effectiveness of synthetic aperture techniques is directly dependent on positional accuracy. It is also shown that since systems utilising larger aperture transducers with a narrow field of view are not as dependent on synthetic array reconstruction, they can outperform systems with narrower transducers in cases where there is relatively large positional uncertainty. Lastly the resolution and relative SNR are modelled as functions of transducer aperture for the cases of B-scan and synthetic array processing.
Artificial cochlea and acoustic black hole travelling waves observation: Model and experimental results
 An inhomogeneous fluid structure waveguide reproducing passive behaviour of the inner ear is modelled with the help of the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin method. A physical setup is designed and built. Experimental results are compared with a good correlation to theoretical ones. The experimental setup is a varying width plate immersed in fluid and terminated with an acoustic black hole. The varying width plate provides a spatial repartition of the vibration depending on the excitation frequency. The acoustic black hole is made by decreasing the plate׳s thickness with a quadratic profile and by covering this region with a thin film of viscoelastic material. Such a termination attenuates the flexural wave reflection at the end of the waveguide, turning standing waves into travelling waves.
Inductive and magnetic sensors
 Inductive and magnetic sensors employ variables and parameters like magnetic induction, magnetic flux, self-inductance, mutual inductance, or magnetic resistance. By a particular construction of the device, these quantities are made dependent on an applied displacement or force. First we review various magnetic quantities and their relations. Next the operation and the specifications of the major types of magnetic and inductive sensors are analyzed, including Hall sensors, fluxgate sensors, eddy current sensors, and magnetostrictive sensors. Special attention is given to transformer-type sensors (e.g., linear variable differential transformer and resolvers). How inductive and magnetic sensors can be interfaced to electronic processing systems is explained in the next section. This chapter concludes with a section on applications, in which inductive and magnetic sensors are used to solve particular measurement problems.
Intelligent multichannel sensors for pulse wave analysis
 Aortic pulse wave velocity is an independent predictive indicator for all cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Unfortunately it is only invasively accessible and thus the A. carotis–A. femoralis pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) is recommended as a non-invasive substitute. This work presents a model based analysis method for the beat-to-beat online determination of an arbitrary, peripheral pulse transit time (PTT). The method is based on the recording of a three lead electrocardiography (ECG) and of pulse waves (PW) at a peripheral site such as the A. carotis by means of a multiple sensor array. The two modules for the signal acquisition work autonomously but time-wise simultaneously and transmit the data via a radio unit to the central processing unit. There the algorithms for the pulse transit time determination exploit these signals. In doing so the main focus is on an efficient implementation to assure real-time usability. The evaluation of the developed modules and algorithms was done in two separate trials. First the algorithms were tested offline against manual signal annotation using invasive data previously recorded to proof their accuracy. The resulting mean differences in PTT for pulse waves assessed at the aortic root and the aortic bifurcation are 2.86 ms (4.72 ms SD) and 2.00 ms (2.28 ms SD). To evaluate the whole system integrity in a second step online measurements on probands were carried out and compared to data from literature. The trials resulted in a mean PTT of 174.6 ms (17.7 ms SD) for the A. radialis and of 81.9 ms (13.2 ms SD) for the A. carotis. The results suggest that the method may be useful and deployable at general practitioners (GP) and in ambulatory care of (chronic) cardiovascular diseases.
Ex situ thermo-catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors using a traveling wave microwave reactor
 Microwave heating offers a number of advantages over conventional heating methods, such as, rapid and volumetric heating, precise temperature control, energy efficiency and lower temperature gradient. In this article we demonstrate the use of 2450 MHz microwave traveling wave reactor to heat the catalyst bed for thermo-catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors. HZSM-5 catalyst was tested at three different temperatures (290°, 330° and 370 °C) at a catalyst to biomass ratio of 2. Results were compared with conventional heating and induction heating method of catalyst bed. The yields of aromatic compounds and coke deposition were dependent on temperature and method of heating. Microwave heating yielded higher aromatic compounds and lower coke deposition. Microwave heating was also energy efficient compared to conventional reactors. The rate of catalyst deterioration was lower for catalyst heated in microwave system.
A traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator with a variable electric R-C load
 A traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator, which is composed of a traveling wave thermoacoustic engine and linear alternators, is promising in solar power generation and energy recovery due to its high efficiency, high reliability, and capability of utilizing low-grade heat. An equivalent acoustic circuit of a linear alternator is first built and analyzed using electro–mechano-acoustical analogy. It is found that the acoustic coupling of the linear alternators to the traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine is crucial to the performance of the system. A traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator with a variable electric R-C load is then constructed and experimentally studied. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results show the importance of mechanical and electrical resonances to the overall performance of the system. Furthermore, the thermal-to-electric efficiency and the electric power are found to be proportional to the pressure amplitude and the square of it in front of the piston of the linear alternator, respectively. By optimizing the load impedance, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator has achieved a maximum electric power of 345.3 W with a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 9.34% and a maximum efficiency of 12.33% with an electric power of 321.8 W at around 65 Hz when helium of 3.0 MPa is used as the working gas.
New soliton solution to the longitudinal wave equation in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod
 This paper examines the effectiveness of an integration scheme which called the extended trial equation method (ETEM) in exactly solving a well-known nonlinear equation of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this respect, the longitudinal wave equation (LWE) that arises in mathematical physics with dispersion caused by the transverse Poisson’s effect in a magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) circular rod, which a series of exact traveling wave solutions for the aforementioned equation is formally extracted. Explicit new exact solutions are derived in different form such as dark solitons, bright solitons, solitary wave, periodic solitary wave, rational function, and elliptic function solutions of the longitudinal wave equation. The movements of obtained solutions are shown graphically, which helps to understand the physical phenomena of this longitudinal wave equation. Many other such types of nonlinear equations arising in non-destructive evaluation of structures made of the advanced MEE material can also be solved by this method.
Real time queue length estimation for signalized intersections using travel times from mobile sensors
 We study how to estimate real time queue lengths at signalized intersections using intersection travel times collected from mobile traffic sensors. The estimation is based on the observation that critical pattern changes of intersection travel times or delays, such as the discontinuities (i.e., sudden and dramatic increases in travel times) and non-smoothness (i.e., changes of slopes of travel times), indicate signal timing or queue length changes. By detecting these critical points in intersection travel times or delays, the real time queue length can be re-constructed. We first introduce the concept of Queue Rear No-delay Arrival Time which is related to the non-smoothness of queuing delay patterns and queue length changes. We then show how measured intersection travel times from mobile sensors can be processed to generate sample vehicle queuing delays. Under the uniform arrival assumption, the queuing delays reduce linearly within a cycle. The delay pattern can be estimated by a linear fitting method using sample queuing delays. Queue Rear No-delay Arrival Time can then be obtained from the delay pattern, and be used to estimate the maximum and minimum queue lengths of a cycle, based on which the real-time queue length curve can also be constructed. The model and algorithm are tested in a field experiment and in simulation.
Toward robust prediction of crossflow-wave instability in hypersonic boundary layers
 Traveling and stationary crossflow-wave instabilities in a laminar Mach 6 boundary layer are investigated on a 38.1% scale model of the Fifth Hypersonic International Flight Research Experiment (HIFiRE-5) elliptic cone at zero angle of attack and yaw. The Langley Stability and Transition Analysis Code (LASTRAC) was used to analyze the crossflow dominated boundary layer in the mid-span region near the downstream end of the model. Disturbance growth rates, wave angles, and phase speeds are computed with LASTRAC using quasi-parallel Linear Stability Theory (LST), Linear Parabolized StabilityEquations (LPSE), and two-plane or surface marching LPSE (2pLPSE). The predicted wave angles and phase speeds are validated using experimental data, and are found to be in better agreement than previous computations. Further numerical analysis is conducted using the Spatial BiGlobal technique (SBG), which simultaneously accounts for wall-normal and spanwise gradients in the mean boundary layer at a particular axial station. For the first time in the literature, a comparison is made between crossflow wave growth rates computed using LST, LPSE, and 2pLPSE and those computed using SBG, accounting for curvature and geometric divergence of the elliptic cone. The agreement between LST, LPSE, and SBG is fair at best, but excellent agreement is realized between 2pLPSE and SBG. This result constitutes a co-verification of the LASTRAC and SBG stability codes, and provides evidence that 2pLPSE accurately models the physics of the traveling-crossflow instability.
Towards an Understanding of the Travel Behavior Impact of Autonomous Vehicles
 This study gathered empirical evidence on adoption patterns of self-driving vehicles, people's likely use of them, and how that might influence amount of travel, mode choice, auto ownership, and other travel behaviour decisions. Because self-driving vehicles are not yet on the market, a car technology acceptance model was applied to understand adoption and use. Researchers implemented a two-stage data collection effort. An online survey was conducted with 556 residents of metropolitan Austin to determine intent to use. Based on results, four “intent to use” categories were determined: (1) extremely unlikely = Rejecters (18%); (2) somewhat unlikely = Conservatives (32%); (3) somewhat likely = Pragmatists (36%); (4) extremely likely = Enthusiasts (14%). Individuals with a higher level of intent to use have any physical conditions that prohibit them from driving; use technology – smartphone, text messaging, Facebook, transportation apps – and are not concerned with data privacy about using online technology; think using self-driving vehicles would be fun, decrease accident risk, and easy to become skilful at using; and believe people whose opinions are valued would like using them. Among those who indicated intent to use, qualitative interviews were conducted to ascertain the impact on their travel behaviour. Most respondents would rather own self-driving vehicles (59%) than just use one (41%), like a Car2Go or Uber taxi. Additionally, respondents reported that using one would have no change on where people would choose to live in Austin (80%), no change to their annual VMT (66%), and no change to the number of vehicles owned (61%).
Thermoacoustic cooler to meet medical storage needs of rural communities in developing countries – High pressure system
 Development of a thermoacoustic cooler driven by a thermoacoustic engine is presented. The engine is of standing wave type and is coupled to a coaxial travelling wave cooler. This is to test the principles of building a linear thermoacoustic engine-cooler coupling that would be easy to make and thus lend itself to the deployment in rural communities of developing countries. These often lack electrical grid connection but require refrigeration capabilities for storing vital medical supplies. Such function could be provided by using waste heat from everyday cooking (biomass combustion) to drive the proposed device. In the presented laboratory demonstrator, the heat input is mimicked by resistive heating (varied from 1.75 to 2.5 kW), the acoustic resonator is made from 6-in. diameter stainless steel pipe with the total device length of about 3.7 m, and the working gas is air at the mean pressure of 10 bar. The system is modelled using DeltaEC and its performance verified experimentally. The lowest temperature, obtained at zero cooling load, is −19.7 °C, while the cooling load of 120 W can be applied at the cooling temperature of +8 °C, which is one of the criteria for storing medical supplies. The maximum COPR is 5.94%.
Separation of waves governed by the one-dimensional wave equation—a stochastic systems approach
 In various applications it is of interest to extract the wave traveling in a certain direction of a medium. As waves that propagate in different directions generally overlap, it is not possible to directly measure the desired wave. This paper presents techniques for separation of waves governed by the one-dimensional wave equation in the presence of measurement noise. The derived estimators are based on stochastic modeling of the waves and measurement noise, state space representations and optimal state estimation. The treatment of measurement noise is of crucial importance since it fundamentally limits the performance of wave separation. The derived estimators are compared and evaluated through analytical results and computer simulations. The efficiency of the wave estimation does not only depend on the magnitudes of the waves and the noise, but also on the structure of the estimator, the number of sensors and the spacing between sensors. It is shown that the wave traveling in a certain direction can be estimated with high accuracy without amplification of the measurement noise.
Surface acoustic wave sensors in the bioanalytical field: Recent trends and challenges
 This is a comparison of the latest developments in the emerging field of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. Progress has been made particularly with regard to (sub-) microstructure technology and material sciences. Improvements are displayed based on the impact on a new generation of SAW sensors working efficiently in liquid media, from modeling to the fabrication steps of the individual components. It is explained, which obstacles have to be overcome for applications to the bioanalytical field. SAW sensors are shown to be extremely useful for the analysis of both small and large molecules as well as whole cells interacting with an immobilized binding partner. The output signal gives information about the pure mass loading, intrinsic properties of bound materials, or viscoelastic effects like structural rearrangements. Different setups are shown that minimize the influence of physical bulk effects on the sensor signal, e.g. salt content and viscosity. The choice of materials which can be used for sensible surfaces are presented, enabling the development of completely new coupling chemistries. Finally, the advantages compared to other biosensor technologies are pointed out.
Nonlinear Lamb waves for fatigue damage identification in FRP-reinforced steel plates
 A nonlinear Lamb-wave-based method for fatigue crack detection in steel plates with and without carbon fibre reinforcement polymer (CFRP) reinforcement is presented in this study. Both numerical simulation and experimental evaluation were performed for Lamb wave propagation and its interaction with a fatigue crack on these two steel plate types. With the generation of the second harmonic, the damage-induced wave nonlinearities were identified by surface-bonded piezoelectric sensors. Numerical simulation revealed that the damage-induced wave component at the second harmonic was slightly affected by the existence of CFRP laminate, although the total wave energy was decreased because of wave leakage into the CFRP laminate. Due to unavoidable nonlinearity from the experimental environments, it was impractical to directly extract the time-of-flight of the second harmonic for locating the crack. To this end, the correlation coefficient of benchmark and signal with damage at double frequency in the time domain was calculated, based on which an imaging method was introduced to locate the fatigue crack in steel plates with and without CFRP laminates.
Comparing simulated and observed EMIC wave amplitudes using in situ Van Allen Probes’ measurements
 We perform a statistical study calculating electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave amplitudes based off in situ plasma measurements taken by the Van Allen Probes’ (1.1–5.8 Re) Helium, Oxygen, Proton, Electron (HOPE) instrument. Calculated wave amplitudes are compared to EMIC waves observed by the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science on board the Van Allen Probes during the same period. The survey covers a 22-month period (1 November 2012 to 31 August 2014), a full Van Allen Probe magnetic local time (MLT) precession. The linear theory proxy was used to identify EMIC wave events with plasma conditions favorable for EMIC wave excitation. Two hundred and thirty-two EMIC wave events (103 H+-band and 129 He+-band) were selected for this comparison. Nearly all events selected are observed beyond L = 4. Results show that calculated wave amplitudes exclusively using the in situ HOPE measurements produce amplitudes too low compared to the observed EMIC wave amplitudes. Hot proton anisotropy (Ahp) distributions are asymmetric in MLT within the inner (L < 7) magnetosphere with peak (minimum) Ahp, ∼0.81 to 1.00 (∼0.62), observed in the dawn (dusk), 0000 < MLT ≤ 1200 (1200 < MLT ≤ 2400), sectors. Measurements of Ahp are found to decrease in the presence of EMIC wave activity. Ahp amplification factors are determined and vary with respect to EMIC wave-band and MLT. He+-band events generally require double (quadruple) the measured Ahp for the dawn (dusk) sector to reproduce the observed EMIC wave amplitudes.
Modeling ship-induced waves in shallow water systems: The Venice experiment
 As the size of vessels progressively increases to compete in the global trade, the impact evaluation of navigation in waterways and shallow coastal ecosystems become more important. Therefore, suitable tools to investigate processes are required to support a sustainable management of ship traffic. This work tests a new methodology, based on a numerical model chain, that reproduces the hydrodynamic field close to the ship hull and the ship-induced wave propagation in the surrounding shallow areas. The model chain includes an unstructured hydrodynamic model forced by the near-field estimation of a computational fluid dynamics simulation. The modeling system has been applied to a major navigation channel and surrounding tidal flats in the Venice Lagoon (Italy). Field observations and a theoretical framework were used to characterize the ship waves and to validate the modeling system. Results show that the deeper the initial depression, the larger the dissipation over the tidal flat. In these conditions smaller vessels sailing at higher speed produce smaller waves with low amplitudes compared to larger ships traveling at lower speed. We considered vessels moving at different speeds providing useful information to evaluate impacts and to define criteria for decision support systems for a sustainable management of navigation.
Steady-state visual evoked potentials and travelling waves
 Objective: The amplitude and phase of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is sensitive to cognition and attention but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. This study examines stimulus evoked changes in the SSVEP phase topography and the putative role of travelling waves. Methods: Eighteen subjects viewed a central-field checkerboard and full-field flicker stimulus temporally modulated at the peak alpha rhythm frequency. EEG was recorded from 10 midline scalp sites and the bipolar SSVEP obtained from differences between adjacent electrodes. Results: The SSVEP phase comprised either progressive variations consistent with travelling waves or a phase reversal consistent with standing waves. The checkerboard pattern elicited travelling wave patterns in 14 subjects with estimated phase velocities ranging from 7 to 11 m/s after correcting for folded cortex. The flicker stimulus elicited phase reversals in 9 subjects, suggesting standing waves. Six subjects demonstrated a phase topography specific to the stimulus with travelling wave patterns associated with the checkerboard and standing wave patterns associated with the flicker. Conclusions: These differences suggest the emergence of travelling and standing waves under different spatial configurations of visual input to the cortex and that wave phenomena contribute to the spatiotemporal dynamics of the SSVEP.
Trapped Field Attenuation Characteristics of HTS Bulk Magnet Exposed to External Traveling-Wave Magnetic Field in an HTSLSM
 Traveling-wave magnetic field generated by a linear motor is a typical AC time-varying field. In order to identify the trapped magnetic flux attenuation characteristics of the high temperature superconducting (HTS) bulk magnet exposed to the external traveling-wave field generated by the primary of a developed HTS linear synchronous motor (HTSLSM), relevant experiments have been carried out through a built measurement system. As results, the relationships between the trapped magnetic flux attenuation of the HTS bulk magnet and the amplitude, frequency and direction of the external traveling-wave magnetic field are experimentally obtained to allow the HTSLSM characteristics to be practically verified.
Three-axis scanning force sensor with liquid metal electrodes
 Endoscopic palpation is a developing technology that shows promise in identifying early stage small tumors located beneath the surface of an organ. This technology requires sensors to detect the stiffness difference between stiff tumors and soft healthy tissue. This paper proposes a three-axis ballpoint-pen-type force sensor that can scan the surface to measure both shear and reactive forces, which can be used to calculate the distribution of stiffness. The sensor design includes five capacitors, four of which are formed at the lateral side of the cylindrical silicone rubber body. Fabrication of the electrodes is achieved by filling the pockets of a molded polydimethylsiloxane structure with liquid metal. The manufactured sensor was capable of identifying the magnitude and orientation of an applied shear force at 1 N. Detection of a stiff region was also successfully demonstrated.
Development and modelling of a new type of sensor for detecting current transients for power system protection
 A new type of sensor is proposed to detect high frequency transients in currents and their initial polarities. The proposed sensing system replaces both high frequency signal sampling and processing by a simple detection coil wound on a ferrite core and an analogue electronic circuit. It is verified through laboratory experiments that transient occurrence, occurrence time, and initial transient polarity can be determined accurately. A detailed model of the sensor, including the dynamic hysteresis characteristics of the ferrite core, is developed and implemented on an electromagnetic transient simulation software, and verified through experimental measurements. Application of the developed model to simulate a transient current polarity comparison based protection scheme is demonstrated. The versatility of the proposed sensor compared to common digital signal processing based approaches, namely discrete wavelet transform and mathematical morphology, is highlighted using experimental waveforms.
Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors
 This chapter deals with surface-mounted piezoelectric wafer active sensors, a.k.a. PWAS. Their construction and operational principles and coupling with the guided ultrasonic waves traveling in the monitored structure are discussed. The tuning between PWAS and structural guided-wave modes is reviewed and compared with experiments. Pitch-catch and pulse-echo wave propagation in structures instrumented with PWAS transducers is presented. Impact and acoustic emission detection with PWAS transducers is illustrated. PWAS phased arrays for directional beamforming are presented and the embedded ultrasonic structural radar (EUSR) is discussed. 1D (linear) and 2D (circular) PWAS resonators are briefly reviewed. The electromechanical (E/M) impedance method for high-frequency measurement of the local dynamic spectrum of a structure using surface-mounted PWAS transducers and an impedance analyzer is presented and discussed.
Microwave Sensors
 Remote sensing in the microwave or millimeter wave spectrum (approximately 300 MHz–300 GHz) has an enduring and critical role for a wide range of applications. Radar is the most famous microwave remote sensing application, but for most people in the developed world, a microwave is an appliance in their kitchen for heating food (which does use microwave radiation). Modern society also relies heavily on microwaves for geolocation (e.g., GPS) and communication such as Wi-Fi, mobile phone networks, and satellite communications. This article provides a comprehensive study of microwave remote sensing fundamentals for passive applications (i.e., listening or measuring naturally emitted microwave energy) with appropriate connections to the active applications (i.e., generating and then measuring the return microwave energy). For more in-depth information on active microwave sensors used in radar applications, see the chapter on Radar Sensors. Microwave remote sensing applications include monitoring the Earth from space (e.g., US NOAA Joint Polar-orbiting Satellite System), monitoring near-by planets using space probes (e.g., NASA’s Mariner 2), and even distant galaxies in radio astronomy (e.g., Arecibo Observatory). This article concentrates on the monitoring the Earth, but much of the instrumentation is applicable to the other applications. A few application examples of microwave sensors include measuring temperature and humidity for weather forecasting, planning disaster relief after severe weather, long-term climate change, and mapping soil moisture for agriculture. The article starts with the first principles of electromagnetic waves and radiative transfer. The second section describes the instrumentation that collects and quantifies the microwave radiation. The third section covers physical mechanisms of retrieving information from the microwave radiation. The fourth section describes quantifying the performance and calibrating the instrumentation. The final section explains the instrument’s verification and validation techniques.
Non-contact ultrasonic gas flow metering using air-coupled leaky Lamb waves
 This paper describes a completely non-contact ultrasonic method of gas flow metering using air-coupled leaky Lamb waves. To show proof of principle, a simplified representation of gas flow in a duct, comprising two separated thin isotropic plates with a gas flowing between them, has been modelled and investigated experimentally. An airborne compression wave emitted from an air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducer excited a leaky Lamb wave in the first plate in a non-contact manner. The leakage of this Lamb wave crossed the gas flow at an angle between the two plates as a compression wave, and excited a leaky Lamb wave in the second plate. An air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducer on the opposite side of this second plate then detected the airborne compression wave leakage from the second Lamb wave. As the gas flow shifted the wave field between the two plates, the point of Lamb wave excitation in the second plate was displaced in proportion to the gas flow rate. Two such measurements, in opposite directions, formed a completely non-contact contra-propagating Lamb wave flow meter, allowing measurement of the flow velocity between the plates. A COMSOL Multiphysics® model was used to visualize the wave fields, and accurately predicted the time differences that were then measured experimentally. Experiments using different Lamb wave frequencies and plate materials were also similarly verified. This entirely non-contact airborne approach to Lamb wave flow metering could be applied in place of clamp-on techniques in thin-walled ducts or pipes.
Mechanisms And Modelling of Wind Driven Waves
 This paper reviews (in qualitative and order of magnitude terms) the main mechanisms determining wind driven waves and their quantitative modelling for the different stages as the wind speed and the Reynolds number both increase, initially through coupling the instability ‘waves’ in the laminar boundary layers above and below the water surface, secondarily through initiation of eddy structures in turbulent boundary flow over flat water surface (’cats paws’) and thirdly as distorted airflow passes over the undulating water surface with different kinds of dynamics, wave shapes (ranging from sinusoidal to pointed forms), amplitude H, wavelength L, travelling at speed cr and growth rate ci/U*, coupled with the flow below the water surface. Significant flow features are the turbulent thin shear layers on the surface and detached ‘critical’ layers above the surface, which are also affected by the variation of surface roughness near the crests of the waves, by recirculating, separated flows near the surface and by high gradients of turbulence structure in the detached critical layers. Two phase flows in the recirculation zones on the lee side of waves leads to spray in the air above the water surface which also amplifies the boundary layer turbulence. Two phase bubbly flows below the surface generate near surface bubbles and may increases the surface drag downstream of the wave crests. The topology of node and saddle singular points in these mean recirculating flows provides a kinematic description of these flows. Idealised dynamical studies are presented of the variation of the wave amplitude through wind forces on waves moving in groups of waves, and thence physical models are proposed for the transfer of wave energy between large and small frequencies and length scales of wave spectra.
A modified design of the omnidirectional EMAT for antisymmetric Lamb wave generation
 This work presents a modified design of electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) that generates only antisymmetric (A0) omnidirectional Lamb wave. The new magnetic configuration includes a solid cylindrical magnet and a ring-shaped magnet surrounding the outside of the solid cylindrical magnet. The diameter of the solid cylindrical magnet is slightly small than the inner diameter of the ring-shaped magnet. The double-turn coil is used instead of a single spiral coil. Numerical simulation is applied to characterize the magnets and determine the coil parameters. Experimental results on a 3 mm-thick aluminum plate show that the modified EMAT we proposed can generate and receive pure single A0 mode Lamb wave with high signal to noise ratio and can effectively meet the imaging requirements.
Dynamic chemical vapor sensing with nanofibrous film based surface acoustic wave sensors
 We report on the use of electrospun nanofibrous film for surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors to enhance its chemical detection capability. Ultrafine (100–300 nm) polyethylene oxide (PEO) fibers with controlled thickness and porosity were electrospun-coated on the surface of a ST-cut quartz SAW sensor. The nanofibrous film provides a high surface area to volume ratio, which can not only offer more adsorption sites for vapor molecules, but also shortens the diffusion length of vapor molecules into polymer material. Compared to conventional thin film coating techniques, the nanofiber-coated SAW sensor shows a higher sensitivity and faster response (shorter adsorption/desorption times). In addition, a theoretical analysis was performed to understand SAW sensor response with nanofibrous film coating. It is concluded that the nanofiber film holds a great potential in enhancing SAW sensor performance for trace level detection of chemical analytes.
Acoustic power delivery to pipeline monitoring wireless sensors
 The use of energy harvesting for powering wireless sensors is made more challenging in most applications by the requirement for customization to each specific application environment because of specificities of the available energy form, such as precise location, direction and motion frequency, as well as the temporal variation and unpredictability of the energy source. Wireless power transfer from dedicated sources can overcome these difficulties, and in this work, the use of targeted ultrasonic power transfer as a possible method for remote powering of sensor nodes is investigated. A powering system for pipeline monitoring sensors is described and studied experimentally, with a pair of identical, non-inertial piezoelectric transducers used at the transmitter and receiver. Power transmission of 18 mW (Root-Mean-Square) through 1 m of a 118 mm diameter cast iron pipe, with 8 mm wall thickness is demonstrated. By analysis of the delay between transmission and reception, including reflections from the pipeline edges, a transmission speed of 1000 m/s is observed, corresponding to the phase velocity of the L(0,1) axial and F(1,1) radial modes of the pipe structure. A reduction of power delivery with water-filling is observed, yet over 4 mW of delivered power through a fully-filled pipe is demonstrated. The transmitted power and voltage levels exceed the requirements for efficient power management, including rectification at cold-starting conditions, and for the operation of low-power sensor nodes. The proposed powering technique may allow the implementation of energy autonomous wireless sensor systems for monitoring industrial and network pipeline infrastructure.
Gravity Waves
 Waves may occur at fluid interfaces when gravity or surface tension provides a restoring force that pushes a deformed surface back toward its equilibrium position. The general formulation of the surface wave problem is nonlinear, even when the flow is inviscid. An appropriate linearization for small surface slope leads to traveling-wave solutions that are dispersive in deep water and nondispersive in shallow water. In particular, the phase and group speeds of deep-water gravity waves are different and both depend on wavelength with longer waves traveling faster. In shallow water, gravity-wave phase and group speeds are equal and depend on the depth of the water in which they travel. The complexity of the situation increases when the waves are nonlinear, when they occur between fluid layers of differing density, and when they occur on density gradients within a stratified fluid. In the latter case, the phase and group velocities are not even in the same direction.
The crack detection and evaluation by elastic wave propagation in open hole structures for aerospace application
 The rectangular plate made of aluminum alloy with a relatively large circular hole in the geometrical center of the structure is subjected to uniform tension. This loading causes that in the vicinity of a hole a process of crack formation is triggered. The crack is detected and evaluated with the use of elastic wave propagation method. The piezoelectric activator is located directly on the edge of the hole and the rest of sensors are placed at an equal distance from the activator. The crack is detected by comparison of the reference, obtained for the intact plate, and the actual signal (pitch-catch measurement). The appropriate damage magnitude measurement is proposed. Moreover, the system, which works without knowledge of an intact structure, is also discussed. In order to estimate and visualize the length of a crack, the advanced diagnostic imaging is introduced. The applied method is based on a visualization of sensing paths with an assigned value of correlation coefficients, computed for reference and actual signals. The effectiveness of the described system is verified with the use of numerical simulation and experimental test. The theoretical analysis is carried out with the use of the finite element method. The computations are performed for several assumed lengths of cracks. The obtained theoretical results, as well as the experimental analysis, confirm the fact that the crack can be detected at an early stage of formation. Moreover, a relatively good agreement between the real crack lengths and the ones obtained with the use of the proposed method is observed in the numerical analysis as well as in the experiment.
Robust sensor placement for pipeline monitoring: Mixed integer and greedy optimization
 Intelligent water systems – aided by sensing technologies – have been identified as an important mechanism towards ensuring the resilience of urban systems. In this work, we study the problem of sensor placement that is robust to intermittent failures of sensors, i.e. sensor interruptions. We propose robust mixed integer optimization (RMIO) and robust greedy approximation (RGA) solution approaches. The underlying idea of both approaches is to promote solutions that achieve multiple detectability of events, such that these events remain detectable even when some sensors are interrupted. Additionally, we apply a previously proposed greedy approximation approach for solving the robust submodular function optimization (RSFO) problem. We compare scalability of these approaches and the quality of the solutions using a set of real water-networks. Our results demonstrate that considering sensor interruptions in the design stage improves sensor network performance. Importantly, we find that although the detection performances of RMIO and RGA approaches are comparable, RMIO generally has better performance than RGA, and is scalable to large-scale networks. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that RMIO and RGA approaches tend to outperform the RSFO approach.
Correction of multi-frequency GPR wave velocity with distorted hyperbolic reflections from GPR surveys of underground utilities
 Estimation of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) wave velocity and the real part of dielectric permittivity (ε′) play an important role when assessing the condition of buried objects because ε′ is highly affected by moisture and void content in materials. However, errors in velocity occur due to the effect of oblique angles between the alignment of pipelines and GPR traverses during common offset survey. In this paper, field experiments on paving blocks and reinforced concrete were conducted in order to investigate errors caused by the effects of oblique angles on GPR wave velocity. GPR traverses were designed to travel along several oblique angles (θ = 30°, 45°, 60°¸75°, 90°, 105°, 120°, 135° and 150°) relative to the alignment of a ductile iron (DI) pipe. Antennas with various nominal centre frequencies (IDS 200/600, GSSI 400/900 and Sensor & Software 250 MHz) were applied in order to compare the effects. It was found that wider and flatter hyperbolic reflections are obtained and the estimated GPR wave velocity is higher if the included angle between the alignment of the DI pipe and GPR traverse changes from being perpendicular to oblique. The relative error of velocities estimated at oblique angles when compared to that estimated in perpendicular cases can be as much as 44%. Specific steps were taken to correct the errors. It is believed that this study suggests a method whereby the measurement accuracy of velocity estimation for GPR condition surveys of underground utilities can be increased.
Laboratory studies of ultrasonic wave response of fractures with different lengths: Anisotropy characteristics and coda analysis
 Ultrasonic wave propagation in a synthetic medium with different scale fractures is investigated through the physics modeling research. The experiment model consisting of two layers, the first layer is divided into four fractured blocks with a constant fracture density but different dimension and a block without fractures as the reference region. The velocity and reflected amplitude of wave derived from the wide azimuth data processing are anisotropic due to the fractured layer. Coda wave characteristics versus offset and azimuth are obviously different for varying fracture scales. The ratio of wavelength and fracture dimension is an important parameter in the wave-fracture interaction based on the multiple scattering theory. When the wavelength of the incident wave is close to the fracture length, the scattering is dominant in the shot records and the waves are slowed and attenuated largely for the reflections from the bottoms of fractured layer and base model. The physical modeling results demonstrate that it is possible to extract fracture dimension and orientation information by analyzing code and primary waves from the reflection data.
The average shape of large waves in the coastal zone
 The ability of the NewWave focused wave group (the scaled auto-correlation function) to represent the average shape in time of large waves in a random sea state makes it a useful tool for the design of offshore structures. However, the profile has only been validated against field data for waves on deep and intermediate water depths. A similar validation is advisable when applying NewWave to shallow water problems, where waves are less dispersive and more nonlinear. For this purpose, data recorded by two Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO) wave buoys during two large storms in January 2014 are analysed to assess the ability of NewWave to replicate the average shape of large waves in shallow water. A linear NewWave profile is shown to successfully capture the average shape of the largest waves from the Perranporth and Porthleven wave buoys during these large storm events. The differences between the measurements obtained by a surface-following buoy and a fixed sensor become important when considering the ability of a second-order corrected NewWave profile to capture weakly nonlinear features of the measured data. A general expression for this effect is presented for weakly nonlinear waves on intermediate water depths, leading to Lagrangian second-order sum corrections to the linear NewWave profile. A second-order corrected NewWave profile performs reasonably well in capturing the average features of large waves recorded during the January storms. These findings demonstrate that the NewWave profile is valid in relatively shallow water (kpD values less than 0.5), and so may have potential for use as a design wave in coastal engineering applications.
Fiber optic sensors for sub-centimeter spatially resolved measurements: Review and biomedical applications
 One of the current frontier of optical fiber sensors, and a unique asset of this sensing technology is the possibility to use a whole optical fiber, or optical fiber device, as a sensor. This solution allows shifting the whole sensing paradigm, from the measurement of a single physical parameter (such as temperature, strain, vibrations, pressure) to the measurement of a spatial distribution, or profiling, of a physical parameter along the fiber length. In the recent years, several technologies are achieving this task with unprecedentedly narrow spatial resolution, ranging from the sub-millimeter to the centimeter-level. In this work, we review the main fiber optic sensing technologies that achieve a narrow spatial resolution: Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) dense arrays, chirped FBG (CFBG) sensors, optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) based on either Rayleigh scattering or reflective elements, and microwave photonics (MWP). In the second part of the work, we present the impact of spatially dense fiber optic sensors in biomedical applications, where they find the main impact, presenting the key results obtained in thermo-therapies monitoring, high-resolution diagnostic, catheters monitoring, smart textiles, and other emerging applicative fields.
Observations of nearshore infragravity wave dynamics under high energy swell and wind-wave conditions
 Infragravity waves (0.005–0.04 Hz) can dominate the water motion close to shore on low sloping beaches and play a significant role in beach and dune erosion. A new field data set of water surface elevation at 15 cross-shore locations on a dissipative, fetch-unlimited beach is analysed to investigate the forcing and surf zone behaviour of infragravity waves during a wide range of offshore wave conditions (Ho=0.38–3.88 m; Tp=6–20 s). Infragravity waves approach the shore as bound waves lagging slightly (~4 s) behind the short wave (0.04–0.33 Hz) envelope and are released in the surf zone as free waves. Infragravity wave heights of up to 1 m are measured close to shore and are best predicted using an offshore forcing parameter that represents the short wave energy flux (Ho2Tp). Considerable infragravity dissipation is observed in the surf zone and dissipation increases with offshore wave energy. Dissipation is highly frequency-dependant and a frequency-domain Complex Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis reveals (quasi-)standing waves at frequencies <0.017 Hz, but an increasingly progressive wave pattern at higher frequencies with reflection coefficients <0.1, indicative of more than 90% dissipation. Much of the observed dissipation occurs very close to shore and the dependence of the reflection coefficient on a normalised bed slope parameter implies that energy at high infragravity frequencies is dissipated by wave breaking, since these frequencies fit into a mild sloping regime. This is supported by the results of bispectral analysis which show predominantly infragravity-infragravity interactions in shallow water and the development of infragravity harmonics indicative of steepening and eventual breaking of the infragravity waves.
Interfacial wave velocity of vertical gas-liquid annular flow at different system pressures
 In two-phase annular flow, the velocity of interfacial waves play a crucial role in mass transport of liquid film, radial velocity distribution of liquid film, friction pressure drop, momentum transfer of two phases and heat-transfer characteristic of liquid film. Majority of existing interfacial wave velocity predictive correlations is established by the experimental data available in literatures which are limited to near atmospheric conditions. So it is necessary to further study the accuracy and applicability of predictive correlations at intermediate and high pressure conditions. The near infrared (NIR) sensor is designed for the interfacial wave velocity measurement in this paper. Air-water annular flow experiments have been conducted at five pressure conditions (from 0.2 MPa to 0.9 MPa) in a stainless steel tubular test section having an inside diameter 50.0 mm. A comparison of the performance of four existing predictive correlations (i.e. Kumar et al. [3] correlation, Omebere-Iyari et al. [5] correlation, Schubring et al. [8] correlation and Al-Sarkhi et al. [9] correlation) based on experimental dataset mentioned above (154 data points) is made. Comparison analysis between the correlations are made and appropriate recommendations drawn (Kumar et al. [3] correlation and Omebere-Iyari et al. [5] correlation). On the basis of the Kumar et al. [3] correlation, both the density increasing of gas core caused by entrained droplet and relative velocities of gas core and liquid film interface are considered, the structure of model is optimized reasonably, a modified wave velocity correlation which could acceptably handle the data of different system pressures is proposed. Laboratory results indicate that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the modified correlation is 5.37% and the relative deviations are within ±10% error band. By extending the data range for empirical contants fitting, the 84.98% relative error of the improved model is within ±20% error band for the all available data (authors' and literature). The improved correlation has a certain extrapolation for different system pressure and pipe diameter conditions.
Wave runup on a surging vertical cylinder in regular waves
 The wave runup caused by a vertical cylinder surging in regular waves is studied both experimentally and numerically. The so-called DualSPHysics Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code is used for the 3-D numerical modelling. A wide range of cylinder sizes and wave conditions is investigated with results comparing favourably between the experimental and SPH model under both fixed and forced-surge conditions. The experimental and SPH results are further used to predict the maximum runup amplification, in particular the ratio of the runup caused by the surging cylinder to that of the fixed, over the phase difference between the incident wave and surge motion. This maximum runup ratio has been analysed for its dependence on factors such as wave steepness, wave scattering and surge amplitude. An empirical equation is proposed for predicting the maximum runup ratio from known incident wave and surge conditions. Comparison with results from linear solvers suggests that the linear solvers under-predict the full nonlinear runup by a factor of 1.3–1.5.
A chirp excitation for focussing flexural waves
 In this paper, the dispersive nature of flexural waves is exploited to generate a shock response at an arbitrary location on a waveguide. The input waveform is an up-chirp whose instantaneous frequency is chosen to ensure synchronous arrival at an arbitrary focal point. An analytical expression is derived for the required chirp waveform as a function of bandwidth and focal point location given prior knowledge of the dispersion relation. The principle is illustrated for an analytical model of a uniform beam. Simulated results show that it is possible, in theory, to achieve peak responses that are at least an order of magnitude larger than steady state response due to harmonic excitation. Further, the peak response increases with approximately the square root of distance from the point of excitation when damping is negligible. Velocity, acceleration, normal strain and shear stress exhibit qualitatively similar results which differ quantitatively owing to their different frequency responses with respect to the input. A single degree-of-freedom model of an electrodynamic shaker is coupled to the analytical beam model in order to predict peak mechanical responses per peak input voltage of the chirp waveform. The coupled electromechanical model is then validated experimentally through both frequency response and transient measurements. The technique is potentially applicable to situations where a large and reasonably localised transient response is required on a beam or plate-like structure using minimal instrumentation.
Locating and imaging contact delamination based on chaotic detection of nonlinear Lamb waves
 We propose a novel method for locating and imaging contact delaminations in composite plates, using a network of PZT transducers and the nonlinear Lamb waves. Being immune to noise and sensitive to weak signal, the Duffing chaotic oscillator is utilized to detect the nonlinear harmonics of Lamb waves generated at the contact delamination interfaces. The Lyapunov exponent of the Duffing system output is calculated to quantify the relative intensity of nonlinear second harmonic. Its normalized value is taken as the damage index to locate and image the delaminations by combining with the probabilistic imaging algorithm. The numerical simulation study on the proposed method is performed. Compared with the nonlinearity parameter and the conventional damage index, the Lyapunov damage index (LDI) can image the single delamination or multiple delaminations more effectively, especially under the noise interference. The experiment using the LDI is also conducted on a composite laminated plate with multiple internal delaminations. The results show that the proposed imaging method based on LDI is also valid to the practical delaminations in the composite plate. It has the following advantages: immunity to noise, needlessness of baseline data, high imaging resolution and location accuracy.
On errors in low frequency wave measurements from wave buoys
 Floating wave buoys are widely considered as a global standard for wave data. Marine renewable energy presents a relatively new industry for wave measurements, requiring a high level of accuracy for applications including resource assessment, performance assessment and engineering design. This study draws on the unique deployment of four identical wave buoys in close proximity and a period of data from a free-floating buoy to classify spurious low frequency measurements as erroneous. The nature of the occurrence of these errors, and their effect on the validity of measurements are also examined. The work shows that the errors are directly related to the drag forces on the buoy, but with a correctly designed filter, the effect of the errors on the wave measurements can be mitigated. A variable filter process is described which improves the accuracy of measurements captured by these buoys. This is recommended for all interpretation of these data, and is essential for any detailed statistical analysis.
Characteristics of traveling wave ultrasonic motor under atmosphere and vacuum cycle condition
 Under atmosphere and vacuum cycle condition, characteristics of a disc-type traveling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM) are tested, variations of rotation speed with time and load are also obtained. Two vacuum conditions used are low vacuum of 2 Pa and high vacuum of 5 × 10−3 Pa. The lower the environment pressure is, the smaller the rotation speed of TWUSM. And load characteristics of TWUSM in vacuum are poorer than that in atmosphere. Then, using polyfluortetraethylene (PTFE) composite and p-hydroxybenzoic acid polymer (Ekonol) composite as friction materials, load characteristics of TWUSM are compared. As a result, the load characteristics of Ekonol composite are better than the former one, which can hold bigger torque with higher speed. Both principle of ultrasonic motor and knowledge of tribology are applied to analyze the reason that stall torque of TWUSM in vacuum is smaller than in atmosphere.
Dissipation of stop-and-go waves via control of autonomous vehicles: Field experiments
 Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.
Detection and assessment of pitting corrosion in rebars using scattering of ultrasonic guided waves
 The present study aims at developing a robust non-destructive evaluation technique by using the scattering of ultrasonic guided waves for early detection and assessment of localised damage in bare rebars in the form of corrosion pits. The guided wave interaction with the pitting corrosion is numerically simulated by using finite element analysis, and the results are validated with experiments. The received signal contains several wave packets, which could be identified as various scattered modes that are generated from the edges of the corroded region. It is found that when the damage is placed at the centre of the rebar, several scattered wave modes superimpose to form two distinct wave packets in the received signal. A damage index is proposed by using these two distinct wave packets. It is shown that the proposed damage index method can be used successfully to monitor the axial extent and intensity of pitting corrosion in rebars. However, for the pitting corrosion that is situated at an arbitrary position, a different methodology, which utilises the differential time of arrival of various scattered wave modes, is proposed to identify the location of the pitting corrosion. Finally, a non-dimensional parameter, namely the scatter coefficient, is defined to analyse the energy contributions of various scatter modes. It is found that this scatter coefficient gradually increases with the mass loss and that the increment is pronounced when the corrosion pit is closer to the receiver location. The findings of the study can be used to identify the pitting corrosion in bare rebars.
Mitotic Cortical Waves Predict Future Division Sites by Encoding Positional and Size Information
 Dynamic spatial patterns such as traveling waves could theoretically encode spatial information, but little is known about whether or how they are employed by biological systems, especially higher eukaryotes. Here, we show that concentric target or spiral waves of active Cdc42 and the F-BAR protein FBP17 are invoked in adherent cells at the onset of mitosis. These waves predict the future sites of cell divisions and represent the earliest known spatial cues for furrow assembly. Unlike interphase waves, the frequencies and wavelengths of the mitotic waves display size-dependent scaling properties. While the positioning role of the metaphase waves requires microtubule dynamics, spindle and microtubule-independent inhibitory signals are propagated by the mitotic waves to ensure the singularity of furrow formation. Taken together, we propose that metaphase cortical waves integrate positional and cell size information for division-plane specification in adhesion-dependent cytokinesis.
Review of salinity measurement technology based on optical fiber sensor
 A review of the salinity measurement technology based on the optical fiber sensor is presented. The principles of optical fiber measurement, the structures of probes and the characteristics of various sensing structures are concerned. Firstly, this paper discusses the relationship between the salinity and refractive index, and the effect of ion pairs on the refractive index. Secondly, four methods of direct or non-direct measurements of salinity are summarized, including optical refraction method, optical fiber grating, optical interference and surface plasmon effect. Subsequently, the article compares performances of various sensing structures and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of different sensors. Finally, a prospect of salinity measurement requirement and the development direction of fiber-optic sensors in this area are addressed.
Fabrication and characterization of multimode optical fiber sensor for chemical temperature monitoring using optical time domain reflectometer
 In this work, the optical fiber sensor system to measure the optical loss due to temperature variation of gasoline and toluene was papered. The optical fiber sensor was characterized using optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). The sensor was a 50 cm multimode fiber with about 1–3 cm at its central region being partially unclad. The partial uncladding was carried out using chemical etching technique. The optical loss of sensor was measured when unclad part exposed to gasoline and toluene respectively at different temperature ranging from 25 °C to 60 °C. The optical loss of sensor increases in a step drop of OTDR trace as the temperature is increased. The rate of optical loss was estimated to be 0.01576 dB/°C and 0.02212 dB/°C for gasoline and toluene respectively.
Arterial travel time estimation based on vehicle re-identification using wireless magnetic sensors
 A practical system is described for the real-time estimation of travel time across an arterial segment with multiple intersections. The system relies on matching vehicle signatures from wireless sensors. The sensors provide a noisy magnetic signature of a vehicle and the precise time when it crosses the sensors. A match (re-identification) of signatures at two locations gives the corresponding travel time of the vehicle. The travel times for all matched vehicles yield the travel time distribution. Matching results can be processed to provide other important arterial performance measures including capacity, volume/capacity ratio, queue lengths, and number of vehicles in the link. The matching algorithm is based on a statistical model of the signatures. The statistical model itself is estimated from the data, and does not require measurement of ‘ground truth’. The procedure does not require measurements of signal settings; in fact, signal settings can be inferred from the matched vehicle results. The procedure is tested on a 1.5 km (0.9 mile)-long segment of San Pablo Avenue in Albany, CA, under different traffic conditions. The segment is divided into three links: one link spans four intersections, and two links each span one intersection.
Evidence for crustal low shear-wave speed in western Saudi Arabia from multi-scale fundamental-mode Rayleigh-wave group-velocity tomography
 We investigate the crustal and upper-mantle shear-velocity structure of Saudi Arabia by fundamental-mode Rayleigh-wave group-velocity tomography and shear-wave velocity inversion. The seismic dataset is compiled using ∼140 stations of the Saudi National Seismic Network (SNSN) operated by the Saudi Geological Survey (SGS). We measure Rayleigh-wave group-velocities at periods of 8–40 s from regional earthquakes. After obtaining 1-D shear-wave velocity models by inverting group-velocities at each grid node, we construct a 3-D shear-velocity model for Saudi Arabia and adjacent regions by interpolating the 1-D models. Our 3-D model indicates significant lateral variations in crustal and lithospheric thickness, as well as in the shear-wave velocity over the study region. In particular, we identify zones of reduced shear-wave speed at crustal levels beneath the Cenozoic volcanic fields in the Arabian Shield. The inferred reductions of 2–5% in shear-wave speed may be interpreted as possibly indicating the presence of partial melts. However, their precise origin we can only speculate about. Our study also reveals an upper-mantle low velocity zone (LVZ) below the Arabian Shield, supporting the model of lateral mantle flow from the Afar plume. Further geophysical experiments are needed to confirm (or refute) the hypothesis that partial melts may exist below the Cenozoic volcanism in western Saudi Arabia, and to build a comprehensive geodynamic–geological model for the evolution and present state of the lithosphere of the Arabian Plate and the Red Sea.
Element centered smooth artificial viscosity in discontinuous Galerkin method for propagation of acoustic shock waves on unstructured meshes
 This work aims at developing a high-order numerical method for the propagation of acoustic shock waves using the discontinuous Galerkin method. High order methods tend to amplify the formation of spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon) around the discontinuities/shocks, associated to the relative importance of higher-harmonics resulting from nonlinear propagation (in our case). To handle this critical issue, a new shock sensor is introduced for the sub-cell shock capturing. Thereafter, an element-centered smooth artificial viscosity is introduced into the system wherever an acoustic shock wave is sensed. Validation tests in 1D and 2D configurations show that the method is well-suited for the propagation of acoustic shock waves along with other physical effects like geometrical spreading and diffraction.
A vertical-axis unidirectional rotor for wave energy conversion
 A vertical-axis rotor design for wave energy conversion is discussed in this work. The rotor has a number of cup blades laid out around its shaft. In ocean waves, water particles perform omnidirectional motion. While exposed in waves and driven by omnidirectional flows, the rotor performs unidirectional rotation about its vertically oriented shaft. This rotor concept was tested in a wave flume under various rotor parameters and wave conditions. Results show that the rotor's unidirectional behavior is profound, yet fluctuation of the unidirectional angular velocity broadly exists. A parametric study further revealed relations between the rotor's mean angular velocity and some other parameters.
Wave-filter-based approach for generation of a quiet space in a rectangular cavity
 This paper is concerned with the generation of a quiet space in a rectangular cavity using active wave control methodology. It is the purpose of this paper to present the wave filtering method for a rectangular cavity using multiple microphones and its application to an adaptive feedforward control system. Firstly, the transfer matrix method is introduced for describing the wave dynamics of the sound field, and then feedforward control laws for eliminating transmitted waves is derived. Furthermore, some numerical simulations are conducted that show the best possible result of active wave control. This is followed by the derivation of the wave filtering equations that indicates the structure of the wave filter. It is clarified that the wave filter consists of three portions; modal group filter, rearrangement filter and wave decomposition filter. Next, from a numerical point of view, the accuracy of the wave decomposition filter which is expressed as a function of frequency is investigated using condition numbers. Finally, an experiment on the adaptive feedforward control system using the wave filter is carried out, demonstrating that a quiet space is generated in the target space by the proposed method.
Principles of Drag Force Flow Sensor
 Drag force flow (DFF) sensor is a process analytical technology (PAT) for real-time inline monitoring of wet mass consistency during high-shear wet granulation. The DFF probe is a hollow cylindrical pin, whose minute deflection is measured by optical strain gages. Time-dependent deflection of the pin can be connected to single granule impacts and bulk wet-mass action. When used in a granulator, sensor dynamic measurement can be characterized with force pulse magnitude (FPM), a quantity related to blade action. Time-dependent histograms of FPMs are described adequately by lognormal distribution and provide two principal outputs: mean (MFPM) and width (WFPM). These two parameters are indicative of fundamental material properties, such as shear viscosity and granule size and density, because they were changing during the granulation process. The dynamics of MFPM and WFPM could be correlated to granulation end point and used for scaleup.
Wave Mechanics of the Vestibular Semicircular Canals
 The semicircular canals are biomechanical sensors responsible for detecting and encoding angular motion of the head in 3D space. Canal afferent neurons provide essential inputs to neural circuits responsible for representation of self-position/orientation in space, and to compensatory circuits including the vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-collic reflex arcs. In this work we derive, to our knowledge, a new 1D mathematical model quantifying canal biomechanics based on the morphology, dynamics of the inner ear fluids, and membranous labyrinth deformability. The model takes the form of a dispersive wave equation and predicts canal responses to angular motion, sound, and mechanical stimulation. Numerical simulations were carried out for the morphology of the human lateral canal using known physical properties of the endolymph and perilymph in three diverse conditions: surgical plugging, rotation, and mechanical indentation. The model reproduces frequency-dependent attenuation and phase shift in cases of canal plugging. During rotation, duct deformability extends the frequency bandwidth and enhances the high frequency gain. Mechanical indentation of the membranous duct at high frequencies evokes traveling waves that move away from the location of indentation and at low frequencies compels endolymph displacement along the canal. These results demonstrate the importance of the conformal perilymph-filled bony labyrinth to pressure changes and to high frequency sound and vibration.
Effects of acoustic waves on plants: An agricultural, ecological, molecular and biochemical perspective
 Plants are sessile organisms that need to face threats presented in its surrounding; consequently, they have developed mechanisms to perceive the signals of the ambient and to process them in order to detect threats or advantageous circumstances that could increase their chances of survival. One of the mechanisms is dedicated to detect sound vibrations (SV) or acoustic waves (AW). The SV has the ability of modifying the behavior of plant cells through Ca2+ and ROS cues linked to signaling process of stressed plants. These signals cause behavior changes in the cell, regulate gene expression and/or modify its biochemical activity in order to face the biotic and abiotic factors that could provoke damage in the plants. The plants face threats through the generation of compounds or substances that cause a signaling cascade and provoke a modification in its behavior. The signaling cascade caused by sound perturbations generally results in the generations of secondary metabolites that are beneficial to human health, principally, against the chronic diseases. Nowadays, reliable mechanism that could explain precisely the ability of plants to perceive, process or emit acoustic waves have not been proposed; however, there are several compounds that are generated when the plant is stressed by biotic and abiotic factors and coincide with compounds that are produced by the plants when they are under a treatment of specific SV. This allows infer that acoustic waves could serve as elicitor, sometimes, cheaper and friendlier with environment compared with the commonly used biotic or abiotic elicitors.
Orbit and Attitude Sensors
 This chapter is concerned with spacecraft sensors as part of position and attitude control loops. It will discuss the principal sensors for the determination of on-board orientation and orbit position. The working principles of these sensors are outlined with the aim of deriving measurement equations and error models. The specific sensor description is derived from a general discussion and formulation of the measurement errors. First, inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are described, with attention to both classical (electromechanical) and modern (electrooptical) technology. Fine electrostatic accelerometers, which can perform as control and science sensors at the same time, are described in preparation of the exposition in Chapter 11 of the drag-free control. The fundamentals of the legacy Global Positioning System (GPS) observables and algorithms are treated in some detail, because GPS is the modern standard navigation instrument. The instrument, generally addressed as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), is now replicated and under replication by Russia, China, and Europe. The chapter ends with a focus on the main attitude sensors, Sun's and Earth's horizon sensors, star trackers, and magnetometers.
Effect of rubber washers on leak location for assembled pressurized liquid pipeline based on negative pressure wave method
 Leakage in pressurized pipelines is a serious problem in petrochemical plants because it might cause a fire or an explosion. The negative pressure wave (NPW) method is a practical method of locating leaks in a pipeline, and it has been used widely in the energy distribution industry. However, it is difficult to obtain the pressure wave velocity accurately and to localize leakage by using NPW method because of the complexity of real pipeline components, especially in assembled pipeline. Thus, in this study, the influence of assembly rubber washer on pressure wave velocity is analyzed; in addition, considering the effect of the rubber washer, a numerical method for calculating the velocity of pressure wave propagation in liquid pipelines is proposed. Then, the propagation velocity of NPWs is measured experimentally to verify the feasibility of the improved method on a self-made pipeline leak detection test platform. The results show that the presence of rubber washers in an assembled pipeline decreases the propagation velocity of NPWs and that the correction model established in this study can adequately modify the propagation velocity of NPWs. The improved method containing the modified formula can improve the accuracy of leak localization for assembled pressurized liquid pipelines.
Stress wave propagation in Boron-Nitride nanotubes
 The propagation of axial stress waves in Boron-Nitride nanotubes of different chirality and length under adiabatic conditions has been studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The velocities of the axial stress waves are found using three methods - (i) direct MD simulations, (ii) harmonic approximation of the nanotubes, and (iii) one-dimensional (1-D) wave equation. The MD simulation results indicate a small dependence of the wave velocities on the nanotube chirality and the excitation frequency – in armchair and zigzag nanotubes waves travel faster than that in chiral nanotubes, and wave velocities decrease with an increase in the frequency of excitation. The wave speed obtained from the harmonic approximations is ≈20–25% higher than that found from the MD simulations. Likewise, the frequencies of vibrations from the two approaches differ by 15–20% for most of the cases. The computation of the wave speed from 1-D equation requires a prior knowledge of the elastic modulus and the nanotube wall thickness. The values of these parameters are found from MD simulation results – axial tensile tests provide an estimate of the wall thickness scaled elastic modulus and the transverse vibration data relates the standard deviation of the tip displacement with material properties of the nanotube. The wave speed predicted from the 1-D wave equation agrees with that obtained from the MD simulations at low excitation frequencies. The contribution of the anharmonicity to the dynamics during wave propagation is found by matching the response of the anharmonic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain with the MD simulation results.
In-pipe coconut water rheological characterization with ultrasonic waves
 We propose in this paper to use a simple and robust experimental protocol based on longitudinal ultrasonic velocity measurement in order to evaluate the viscosity of coconut water in a cylindrical stainless-steel pipe. Seven samples with Soluble Solids Content (SSC) ranging from 6.7 to 44.2°Brix were studied using conventional Couette viscometry and high-frequency ultrasonic methods. Calibration laws linking the ultrasonic velocity measured at 5 MHz to the shear viscosity and to the SSC are proposed. These laws are in very good agreement with previous measurements carried out several years ago using a plane 25 MHz transducer directly introduced into the coconut water with SSC of up to 60°Brix.
Secure sensors data acquisition and communication protection in eHealthcare: Review on the state of the art
 Recent advances in hardware technology have led to the development of low cost, power efficient and more feature rich devices that are amongst the most critical parts of communication networks. These devices or sensors can now sense data with more accuracy, process it by themselves and send it to the neighboring node or the sink node. However, robust and reliable security mechanisms are not yet properly implemented on these sensors due to their limited energy and computation power. Sensors also play a very important role in eHealthcare systems where ubiquitous patient monitoring is performed. As data is generated from the sensor nodes, reliable, secure and attack-resistant data acquisition and transmission is important for an efficient eHealthcare systems. This survey focuses on security issues of sensors data acquisition and transmission protocols, describing their main security features and comparing them in the context of a secure eHealthcare system. A taxonomy of open issues and future challenges is also discussed with respect to specific security metrics described in the paper.
Threshold temperature optical fibre sensors
 This paper presents a new approach to manufacture a threshold temperature sensor based on a biconical optical fibre taper. The presented sensor employs the influence of variable state of concentration of some isotropic materials like wax or paraffin. Application of the above- mentioned materials is an attempt to prove that there is a possibility to obtain a low-cost, repeatable and smart sensor working as an in-line element. Optical fibre taper was obtained from a standard single mode fibre (SMF28®) by using a low pressure gas burner technique. The diameter of the manufactured tapers was 6.0 ± 0.5 μm with the length of elongation equal to 30.50 ± 0.16 mm. The applied technology allowed to produce tapers with the losses of 0.183 ± 0.015 dB. Application of materials with different temperature transition points made it possible to obtain the threshold work at the temperatures connected directly with their conversion temperature. External materials at the temperatures above their melting points do not influence the propagation losses. For each of them two types of the protection area and position of the optical fibre taper were applied.
Analysis of axis symmetric circular crested elastic wave generated during crack propagation in a plate: A Helmholtz potential technique
 This paper presents cylindrical coordinate solutions of axis symmetric circular crested elastic waves that appear due to sudden energy release during incremental crack propagation in a plate. Axis symmetric assumption decouples the elastic wave problem to Lamb (P+SV) and shear (SH) horizontal waves. Helmholtz decomposition principle was used to decompose displacement field in to unknown scalar and vector potentials; and body force vectors to known excitation scalar and vector potentials respectively. Therefore, Navier–Lame equations yield a set of four inhomogeneous wave equations of unknown potentials Φ, Hr, Hθ, Hz and known excitation potentials A*,Br*,Bθ*,Bz*. There are two types of potentials exist in a plate for axis symmetric circular crested Lamb wave: pressure potentials Φ, A* and shear potentials Hθ, Bθ*. Inhomogeneous wave equations for Φ and Hθ were solved due to generalized excitation potentials A* and Bθ* in a form, suitable for numerical calculation. The theoretical formulation shows that elastic waves generated in a plate using excitation potentials follow the Rayleigh-Lamb equations. The resulting solution is a series expansion containing the superposition of all the Lamb wave modes existing for the particular frequency-thickness combination under consideration. In addition, bulk wave solution is also recovered due to the effect of the excitation potentials. The numerical studies modeled the two-dimensional (2D) (circular crested) AE elastic wave propagation in order to simulate the out-of-plane displacement that would be recorded by an AE sensor placed on the plate surface at some distance away from the source. Parameter studies were performed to evaluate: (a) the effect of the pressure and shear potentials; (b) the effect of the thickness-wise location of the excitation potential sources varying from mid-plane to the top surface (source depth effect); (c) the effect of peak time (d) the effect of propagating distance away from the source. A Gaussian pulse is used to model the growth of the excitation potentials during the AE event; as a result, the actual excitation potential follows the error function variation in the time domain. The numerical studies show that the peak amplitude of A0 signal is higher than the peak amplitude of S0 signal and the peak amplitude of bulk wave is not significant compared to S0, A0 peak signals.
An articulated predictive model for fluid-free artificial basilar membrane as broadband frequency sensor
 In this article, an extremely versatile predictive model for a newly developed Basilar meta-Membrane (BM2) sensors is reported with variable engineering parameters that contribute to it’s frequency selection capabilities. The predictive model reported herein is for advancement over existing method by incorporating versatile and nonhomogeneous (e.g. functionally graded) model parameters that could not only exploit the possibilities of creating complex combinations of broadband frequency sensors but also explain the unique unexplained physical phenomenon that prevails in BM2, e.g. tailgating waves. In recent years, few notable attempts were made to fabricate the artificial basilar membrane, mimicking the mechanics of the human cochlea within a very short range of frequencies. To explain the operation of these sensors a few models were proposed. But, we fundamentally argue the “fabrication to explanation” approach and proposed the model driven predictive design process for the design any (BM2) as broadband sensors. Inspired by the physics of basilar membrane, frequency domain predictive model is proposed where both the material and geometrical parameters can be arbitrarily varied. Broadband frequency is applicable in many fields of science, engineering and technology, such as, sensors for chemical, biological and acoustic applications. With the proposed model, which is three times faster than its FEM counterpart, it is possible to alter the attributes of the selected length of the designed sensor using complex combinations of model parameters, based on target frequency applications. Finally, the tailgating wave peaks in the artificial basilar membranes that prevails in the previously reported experimental studies are also explained using the proposed model.
Constraining shallow slip and tsunami excitation in megathrust ruptures using seismic and ocean acoustic waves recorded on ocean-bottom sensor networks
 Great earthquakes along subduction-zone plate boundaries, like the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-Oki, Japan, event, deform the seafloor to generate massive tsunamis. Tsunami wave heights near shore are greatest when excitation occurs far offshore near the trench, where water depths are greatest and fault slip is shallow. The Tohoku event, featuring over 30 m of slip near the trench, exemplifies this hazard. Unfortunately the rupture process that far offshore is poorly constrained with land-based geodetic and even most seafloor deformation measurements, and seismic inferences of shallow slip are often nonunique. Here we demonstrate, through dynamic rupture simulations of the Tohoku event, that long-period guided waves in the ocean (specifically, leaking oceanic P-wave modes known as PL waves) can resolve the shallow rupture process and tsunami excitation near the trench. With predicted pressure changes of ∼0.1–1 MPa along most of the seafloor landward of the trench, and periods of several seconds, these PL waves should be observable with ocean-bottom pressure sensors and/or seismometers. With cabled sensor networks like those being deployed offshore Japan and in other subduction zones, these waves could be used to rapidly quantify shallow slip and near-trench seafloor uplift and improve local tsunami early warning systems.
Dual demodulation interferometer with two-wave mixing in GaAs photorefractive crystal
 A dual demodulation interferometer with two-wave mixing (TWM) in the GaAs photorefractive crystal (PRC) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The GaAs PRC has tiny temperature change under high voltage thus not requiring thermoelectric cooler (TEC) to stabilize the temperature, and adaptive to low frequency fluctuation below 200 Hz. The system is an unbalanced TWM interferometer, which could demodulate the phase change both space variation and wavelength shift induced by strain. Two demodulation modes' formulas are provided in theory respectively. Experimental results have been tested and compared with theoretical analysis, demonstrating that it is a practical and flexible system for detection of mechanical vibration or structure health monitoring (SHM) in engineering by selecting different demodulation mode.
Lamb waves and electro-mechanical impedance based damage detection using a mobile PZT transducer set
 Lamb waves and electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) based methods are increasingly used in damage detection owing to their high sensitivity to small structural defects. Lamb wave based methods are effective in detecting damages in a large area and electro-impedance based methods are suitable for characterizing the identified damage. Based on these two methods, a novel combined damage detection method is presented in this research. To achieve this, first, a mobile transducer set is developed, which can be used for both the Lamb waves and EMI based methods. Then, a baseline-free damage detection strategy that combines the Lamb waves and EMI methods is presented. Finally, a laboratory-sized test piece is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results achieved with the application of the presented combined method for characterizing an L-shape crack in an aluminum plate show better location accuracy and detection efficiency than those obtained by applying only one method.
Theoretical investigation and prototype design for non-parallel squeeze film movement platform driven by standing waves
 In order to realize contactless levitation and movement of precision components, a new kind of acoustic prototype driven by standing waves utilizing reverse hydrodynamic effects of non-parallel squeeze film was proposed in this paper. Its mechanism of movement and levitation was revealed by the viscous fluid mechanics and dynamic lubrication theory. It is amazing that the reverse hydrodynamic effects made the levitated plate move along the opposite direction of gravitational tangential component, which was proved in the experiments. The bearing and pushing capacity is predicted by numerical calculation of Reynolds equation and a CFX model. A dimensionless parameter 'voltage difference ratio' was proposed to evaluate the deflection angle of a non-parallel squeeze film, which can guide the prototype design.
WOSPP - A Wave Oriented Swarm Programming Paradigm
 In this paper, we present a possible control paradigm for swarms of mobile agents with limited communication capabilities. The control paradigm is based on communication and movement strategies from slime mould, that uses 1-bit communication for various behaviours of the super organism. We have found that by varying minor details of the classical slime mould based communication strategies and movement cues it is possible to generate substantially different behaviours and features that the swarm is able to perform. Swarm size estimation, pinging synchronization, ego positioning etc. are some behaviours which can be generated by varying minor details of the basic slime mould based communication and movement strategies. Additionally, using several different signals within the swarm and combining them, it is possible to generate an open control paradigm, that allows to construct different behaviours, not bases on the design of individual behaviour but by design of different interacting travelling waves on the different signal layers in the swarm.
Adaptive dual-sensor noise cancellation method for continuous wave mud pulse telemetry
 Mud pulse telemetry is the most commonly used method for transmitting data from downhole to the surface in measurement while drilling (MWD) systems. During the drilling process, the signal received on surface is seriously disturbed by various noise sources, among which the pump noise is the most damaging. The effective cancellation of pump noise is very essential for obtaining correct downhole information and achieving higher data transmission rates. In this paper, an adaptive noise cancellation method using two pressure transducers is studied. The method aims at complex noise environments when two or more mud pumps are used. The fundamental of the method lies on the difference in propagation direction between information signal and pump noise. An adaptive noise cancelling structure is introduced to dynamically estimate the channel characteristics between the two transducers and optimize the noise cancellation output. Both simulations and field experiments were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results indicate that the method can successfully extract the information signal from pump noise with the interference of random noise from both transducers. Field experiments were carried out during a 3000-meter drilling operation. In the experiment, the major components of pump noise in frequency domain have been reduced by 49%–92%. The successful demodulation of the received data indicates that the proposed method can be used to extract downhole information in complex pump noise environment created by two triplex piston pumps.
Realization of an automatic, contactless, acoustic levitation motor via degenerate mode excitation and autoresonance
 This paper develops analytically and experimentally an acoustic levitation motor which has the ability to automatically levitate and rotate an object in the air without mechanical contact. To realize such a device, a novel combination of two methods is applied simultaneously; (i) Automatic resonance tracking with the Autoresonance algorithm in closed loop, (ii) Production of controlled structural traveling waves in open loop. The purpose of the first method is to achieve near-field acoustic levitation, by exciting an aluminum annulus at resonance, and thus carrying an object of a few kilograms on a layer of compressed air above it. The difficulty in maintaining resonance arises from the very high Q value of the annulus, and therefore operating even slightly off resonance ceases levitation. Compounding this is a natural frequency drift as ambient conditions and loading change. To mitigate this drift, and produce stable levitation automatically, the resonance tracking feedback loop is employed. Simultaneously, the purpose of the second method is to achieve a propulsion torque on the levitated object by controlling acoustic traveling waves in the aluminum annulus to rotate the thin layer of air, and hence the levitated body above it. Even though a single vibration mode can produce only standing waves, an axisymmetric structure such as the annulus possesses two modes per natural frequency, and excitation of a degenerate mode pair can generate a pure travelling wave, a pure standing wave, or a mixture of both. The present paper develops the theory behind the use of the Autoresonance feedback method for achieving constant levitation and propagating travelling waves in co- and counter rotating directions. The result is an acoustic motor where stable levitation is achieved automatically and rotation is controlled via a single parameter.
Multi-sensor approach in vessel magnetic wake imaging
 Wake is the hydrodynamic footprint of a vessel at sea. The Earth’s magnetic field makes these footprints visible using magnetic sensors. Magnetic wakes induced by the motion of vessels may extend several kilometers and stay up long hours under certain conditions. From remote sensing point of view, in this work physical properties of this magnetic pattern are studied. A mathematical model is derived to simulate the magnetic wakes in a finite depth sea. Estimation of vessel traveling direction using single airborne sensors is reviewed and some problems in this method are remarked. A multi-sensor arrangement of magnetic transducers is proposed to remove these limitations. Estimation of vessel traveling direction with the proposed sensor configuration is performed. Robustness of the proposed method in dealing with Gaussian white noise and various target cutting angles is shown.
Heterodyne interrogation system for TDM interferometric fiber optic sensors array

The techniques are theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated with recovering the sinusoid wave and triangle wave applied to the sensors. The system has a phase resolution about 1×10−4 rad/√Hz, the amplitude consistency and linearity of the demodulated results are 95.275% and 98.379%, respectively with single frequency event applied to the sensors.
Wave mode diffusion and propagation in structural wave guide under Varying Temperature
 A numerical approach is presented to study the guided wave propagation through periodic specimen with thermal dependence of material properties. There is a great interest in extending the skills of the wave finite element (WFE) method to figure out the variations in the wave propagation properties due to temperature fluctuations. Thermal effects on the dispersion curves thereby on group velocity are discussed. Comparisons between numerical results and analytical developments for various temperatures are given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach to predict the sensitivity of guided wave propagation characteristics in presence of temperature variations.
Parametric study and modeling of PZT based wave propagation technique related to practical issues in monitoring of concrete curing
 This paper presents a series of investigative studies, mainly parametric and numerical, into various issues related to the practical application of the wave propagation (WP) technique in monitoring of concrete curing using smart material (PZT). This paper is an extension of a range of experimental studies presented in the authors’ recent publication. Coupled field finite element (FE) simulation of the PZT-structure interaction in WP technique is conducted on mortar and concrete specimens. Identification of the pressure wave (P-wave) and the surface wave (R-wave) velocities simulated in the FE model is attempted. Results are found to be matching closely with the experiment. The verified FE model, together with the theoretical model are then used to perform parametric study on selected factors related to the practical application of the technique, in particular those uncontrollable in the experiment, including the dynamic modulus of elasticity, the Poisson’s ratio and the damping coefficient. Further experimental and analytical studies on the effect of varying temperature and humidity are also presented. A semi-analytical model previously proposed by the authors is finally adopted to generate a strength calibration chart for concrete with different coarse aggregates. The theoretical and FE models are proven to be useful alternatives to the experiment, which can be used in future design and optimization of the PZT based WP technique in monitoring of concrete curing.
Wavefront evolution of compression waves propagating in high speed railway tunnels
 The amplitude of micro-pressure wave emitted from the exit portal of a high-speed railway tunnel is approximately proportional to the pressure gradient of the internal wavefronts approaching the portal. For long tunnels, the evolution during propagation is an important factor for estimating the pressure gradient in the exit wavefront. Moreover, the relationship between the entrance and exit states depends upon the conflicting influences of inertia and damping along the propagation. In this paper, the investigation is done to study the evolution of wavefronts with different initial waveforms and to assess the influence of friction and train speed in the process. This work is based on numerical simulations of wavefront propagation using a third-order monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws and backed up by field measurements. Numerical analyses show that the wavefront evolution not only depends on the pressure amplitude and the maximum pressure gradient of the initial wavefront but also depends strongly on the shape and timing of the peak steepness of ∂P/∂t. The predictions also demonstrate the existence of a critical tunnel length. For any particular train and tunnel entrance, the magnitudes of the micro-pressure waves increase with the tunnel length when this length is below the critical one and decrease with the tunnel length otherwise. The critical length decreases with the increase of the tunnel wall friction and the train speed.
Physics of meteor generated shock waves in the Earth’s atmosphere – A review
 Shock waves and the associated phenomena generated by strongly ablating meteoroids with sizes greater than a few millimeters in the lower transitional flow regime of the Earth’s atmosphere are the least explored aspect of meteor science. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of literature covering meteor generated shock wave phenomena, from the aspect of both meteor science and hypersonic gas dynamics. The primary emphasis of this review is placed on the mechanisms and dynamics of the meteor shock waves. We discuss key aspects of both shock generation and propagation, including the great importance of the hydrodynamic shielding that develops around the meteoroid. In addition to this in-depth review, the discussion is extended to an overview of meteoroid fragmentation, followed by airburst type events associated with large, deep penetrating meteoroids. This class of objects has a significant potential to cause extensive material damage and even human casualties on the ground, and as such is of great interest to the planetary defense community. To date, no comprehensive model exists that accurately describes the flow field and shock wave formation of a strongly ablating meteoroid in the non-continuum flow regime. Thus, we briefly present the current state of numerical models that describe the comparatively slower flow of air over non-ablating bodies in the rarefied regime. In respect to the elusive nature of meteor generated shock wave detection, we also discuss relevant aspects and applications of meteor radar and infrasound studies as tools that can be utilized to study meteor shock waves and related phenomena. In particular, infrasound data can provide energy release estimates of meteoroids entering the Earth’s atmosphere. We conclude with a summary of unresolved questions in the domain of meteor generated shock waves; topics which should be a focus of future investigations in the field.
Estimation of wave heights from pressure data at the bed in the presence of uniform underlying currents
 We provide some bounds on the estimated wave heights (valid for all ranges of amplitudes) from pressure measurements at the flat bed for steady water waves flowing over underlying uniform currents. The derived upper bound for the wave height for the case when the speed of the underlying current is greater than the wave speed is different from the one when there is no current. The results in this paper also confirm that waves of nontrivial amplitudes cannot exist where the speed of the underlying current is same as the wave speed, a result that was previously proved by Basu (2016) in a different context following another approach.
Acoustoelectric effects in reflection of leaky-wave-radiated bulk acoustic waves from piezoelectric crystal-conductive liquid interface
 The leaky surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagating along X-axis of Y-cut lithium tantalate crystal strongly radiates energy in the form of an obliquely propagating narrow bulk acoustic wave (BAW) beam. The reflection of this beam from the crystal–liquid interface has been investigated. The test liquids were solutions of potassium nitrate in distilled water and of lithium chloride in isopropyl alcohol with the conductivity varied by changing the solution concentration. The strong dependences of the reflected wave amplitude and phase on the liquid conductivity were observed and explained by the acoustoelectric interaction in the wave reflection region. The novel configuration of an acoustic sensor for liquid media featuring important advantages of separate measuring and sensing surfaces and rigid structure has been proposed. The application of leaky-SAW radiated bulk waves for identification of different brands of mineral water has been demonstrated.
Response time of thermal flow sensors with air as fluid
 Due to their fast response time miniaturized thermal flow sensors can be applied well for the measurement of instationary gas flow. For some applications, the response time of the sensor must be known with high accuracy. We investigated three methods for response time determination with air: a jump of temperature induced by electric heating, a gas velocity step made by a membrane burst and acoustic phase shifts between sound velocity and sound pressure (standing and traveling waves). The measurements have shown that the response time of thermal flow sensors is a function of flow velocity. For stagnant flow, the thermal response time is about 4.5 ms for our thermal flow sensors. With increasing flow from the heater to the thermopiles, the heat transfer rises. Thus, the response time is faster and decreases to about 1 ms.
Implementing kinematic wave theory to reconstruct vehicle trajectories from fixed and probe sensor data
 A data fusion framework is examined to reproduce vehicle trajectories on urban arterials by combining probe and fixed sensor data, and signal timing parameters. The methodology is based on the kinematic wave theory and employs the variational theory for the solution method. However, the original methodology cannot deal with the vehicles coming in and out in the middle of the study section despite the frequent existence of such vehicles in the real world. Therefore, the methodology is extended so as to incorporate the vehicles coming in and out. The proposed method is then applied to real world data and its robustness is confirmed by changing the input data characteristics.
Aluminum Nitride SOI Lamb-wave Resonators towards Multi-frequency, Multi-sensitive Temperature Sensor Platform
 We report a resonant sensor platform based on multi-band Lamb acoustic wave resonators and multiple thermal sensitivities. The demonstrated devices are enabled by a powerful platform which uses aluminum nitride (AlN) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate that offers process robustness, design flexibility to provide devices with multiple frequencies within the same process, and multiple temperature coefficients of frequency (TCF) that can be tailored to meet the application needs. Symmetric-mode, zeroth-order resonators (S0) with frequencies between 218 MHz and 1.9 GHz, quality factors (Q) up to 2200, and TCFs from - 11.4 ppm/°C to -2.5 ppm/°C are some of the remarkable features of the platform.
Improved constitutive equations of piezoelectric monomorphs: Application to the preliminary study of an original traveling-wave peristaltic pump
 This article establishes the constitutive equations of a piezoelectric monomorph by separating the effects of the piezoelectric action from the effects of the external loads and by considering in both cases a static equilibrium of forces and moments. Unlike previous studies, our model explicitly incorporates the effects of transverse strains and electric field gradients in order to approach more faithfully the real strains and stresses in the monomorph. This model, which can be easily generalized to other types of benders and applied to complex study cases is used in this paper to analyse the impact of the characteristic parameters of an original traveling-wave peristaltic pump on its performance.
Design and performance evaluation of hybrid optical sensor
 An efficient and cost effective optical sensor is proposed using a hybrid configuration of ring resonator and Bragg grating. The proposed hybrid optical sensor (HOS) is based on transmission power, overlap integral, refractive index profile and wavelength shift by using finite difference time domain photonics simulation software. It has been found that the proposed HOS provides better electric field distribution (0.118 v/m), Poynting vector (1.98e−10), transmittance power (1.75 dB), overlap integral (1.009%), transmission power (0.024 a.u.) and wavelength shift (1 nm) as compared to conventional ring resonator. The proposed design with SiO2 grating obtained highest average sensitivity of 4.97 nm/μe.
The wave and tidal resource of Scotland
 As the marine renewable energy industry evolves, in parallel with an increase in the quantity of available data and improvements in validated numerical simulations, it is occasionally appropriate to re-assess the wave and tidal resource of a region. This is particularly true for Scotland - a leading nation that the international community monitors for developments in the marine renewable energy industry, and which has witnessed much progress in the sector over the last decade. With 7 leased wave and 17 leased tidal sites, Scotland is well poised to generate significant levels of electricity from its abundant natural marine resources. In this state-of-the-art review of Scotland's wave and tidal resource, we examine the theoretical and technical resource, and provide an overview of commercial progress. We also discuss issues that affect future development of the marine energy seascape in Scotland, applicable to other regions of the world, including the potential for developing lower energy sites, and grid connectivity.
A sensor fusion approach for drowsiness detection in wearable ultra-low-power systems
 Drowsiness detection mechanisms have been extensively studied in the last years since they are one of the prevalent causes of accidents within the mining, driving and industrial activities. Many research efforts were done to quantify the drowsiness levels using behavioral analyses based on camera eye tracking systems as well as by analyzing physiological features contained in EEG signals. Detection systems typically use specific drowsiness indicators from only one of these methods, leaving a risk of missed detection since not all the population presents same symptoms of drowsiness. Thus, multi-feature systems are preferable even though most of the current State-of-the-Art (SoA) solutions are based on power-hungry platforms and they have meager chance to be used in embedded wearable applications with long battery lifetime. This work presents a drowsiness detection scheme fusing behavioral information coming from user motion through an IMU sensor and physiological information coming from brain activity through a single EEG electrode. The solution is implemented and tested on a low power programmable platform based on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, resulting in a wearable device capable to detect 5 different levels of drowsiness with an average accuracy of 95.2% and a battery life of 6 hours, using a 200 mAh battery. We also study the energy optimization achievable by accelerating the sensor fusion-based drowsiness detector on a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) platform. Results show that the use of PULP as efficient processing platform provides an energy improvement of 63x with respect to a solution based on a commercial microcontroller. This may extend the battery life of the complete system up to 46 h with a 7x improvement, paving the way for a completely wearable, always-on system.
Wave Tuning with Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors
 This chapter deals with a basic aspect of the interaction between PWAS and structure during the active SHM process, i.e., the tuning between the PWAS and the Lamb waves traveling in the structure. Under electric excitation, the PWAS undergo oscillatory contractions and expansions, which are transferred to the structure through the bonding layer to excite Lamb waves into the structure. In this process, several factors influence the behavior of the excited waves: PWAS length, excitation frequency, wavelength of the guided wave, etc. The interaction of PWAS with the ultrasonic waves generated into the structure is modeled analytically and a solution is developed using space-domain Fourier transform for linear PWAS in interaction with straight-crested Lamb waves and Hankel transform for circular PWAS in interaction with circular-crested Lamb waves. The physical-domain solution is obtained through the residue theorem. Tuning opportunities are shown to exist through matching between the characteristic direction of PWAS expansion and contraction, on the one hand, and the half wavelength of the elastic wave, on the other. The tuning is especially beneficial when dealing with multimode waves because it allows one to select a certain Lamb wave mode as needed by the SHM process. Also studied are the directivity patterns associated with tuning of rectangular PWAS. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by carefully conducted experiments.
On the influence of moisture absorption on Lamb wave propagation and measurements in viscoelastic CFRP using surface applied piezoelectric sensors
 The understanding of the impact of environmental influence factors on propagation and damping of Lamb waves in composite materials is a topic of great interest for both design and utilization of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. In this work, the influence of humidity absorption on the dispersive behavior of Lamb waves propagating in viscoelastic composite materials is investigated. Using a transversely isotropic material model and DMA measurements, the changes in the viscoelastic material properties due to water absorption are characterized. By means of a higher order plate theory and those mechanical properties, the dispersion curves for unconditioned and hot/wet-conditioned UD reinforced CFRP plates are then predicted. Both the changes in Lamb wave velocity and Lamb wave damping are investigated and compared with experimental values. Additionally, the changes of the sensor response, which are related to both the changes of the material properties and that of the adhesive layer, are investigated. The large impact of moisture absorption on Lamb wave excitation and propagation and its relevance for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications is shown and discussed.
Monitoring cell adhesion by using thickness shear mode acoustic wave sensors
 The thickness shear mode (TSM) acoustic wave sensor attached with living cells has been shown to be an effective functional biosensing device to monitor the process of cell adhesion to a surface in real time. In this study, a multilayer sensor model that includes a quartz substrate, a cell–substrate interfacial layer and a cell layer was constructed based on the state of cell adhesion to the substrate. The dynamic process of cell adhesions as a function of cell seeding densities was monitored using the acoustic wave sensor. The mechanisms that are responsible for the frequency and resistance change are discussed according to the predictions of the acoustic wave sensor model. In addition, knowing that the actin cytoskeleton is important for cell adhesion, we investigated the motional resistance change caused by the disruption of actin cytoskeleton induced by fungal toxin cytochalasin D in the human skin fibroblasts. The results indicate that resistance changes are related to the disruption of actin cytoskeleton and dosage-dependent.
Localized damage identification in plate-like structures using self-powered sensor data: A pattern recognition strategy
 This study presents a novel strategy for localized damage identification in plate-like structures based on the binary data provided by self-powered wireless sensors that use a pulse switching communication architecture. The energy-aware pulse switching communication architecture uses single pulses instead of multi-bit packets for information delivery resulting in discrete binary data. A system employing such an energy-efficient technology requires dealing with power budgets for sensing and communication that leads to unique time delay constraints. This paper presents a new paradigm for localized damage detection using time-delayed and sometimes limited binary data. The binary data from the sensor nodes resembles an image, or pattern. Data analysis using pattern recognition (PR) framework incorporating PR methods and a conditional probability chain is thus presented. Numerous features extracted from cumulative acceleration on dynamically loaded plates are used to determine damage indication parameters. Performance of the proposed damage detection strategy was evaluated through finite element simulations for the case of a simply supported aluminum plate under distributed harmonic loading. Different damage states were considered to calibrate the damage detection algorithm, and an uncertainty analysis was performed by superposing random noise to the input vectors. Results show that the proposed PR framework is capable of identifying damage even in the presence of high noise levels. The findings demonstrate satisfactory performance of the localized damage detection strategy, and the applicability of PR to detect and localize damage in plate-like structures from the time-delayed binary data generated by self-powered sensors.
Wireless Sensor Networks in Water Quality Monitoring
 This chapter explores the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in water quality monitoring systems. It first defines WSNs and presents their different architectures and methodologies. It then looks at how WSNs are classified for water quality monitoring applications. It takes a detailed look at the major standards and technologies used in wireless sensor networks, and then presents several water quality applications using WSNs that are implemented worldwide.
Improved numerical wave generation for modelling ocean and coastal engineering problems
 We introduce a dynamic-boundary numerical wave generation procedure developed for wave structure interaction (WSI) simulations typical of ocean and coastal engineering problems. This implementation relies on a dynamic mesh which deforms in order to replicate the motion of the wave-maker, and it is integrated in wsiFoam: a multi-region coupling strategy applied to two-phase Navier-Stokes solvers developed in our previous work [Martínez Ferrer et al. A multi-region coupling scheme for compressible and incompressible flow solvers for two-phase flow in a numerical wave tank. Computer & Fluids 125 (2016) 116–129]. The combination of the dynamic-boundary method with a multi-region mesh counteracts the increase in computational cost, which is intrinsic to simulations featuring dynamic domains. This approach results in a high performance computing wave generation strategy that can be utilised in a numerical wave tank to carry out accurate and efficient simulations of wave generation, propagation and interaction with fixed structures and floating bodies. We conduct a series of benchmarks to verify the implementation of this wave generation method and the capabilities of the solver wsiFoam to deal with wave structure interaction problems. These benchmarks include regular and focused waves, wave interaction with a floating body and the modelling of a wave energy converter, using different wave-maker geometries: piston, flap and plunger. The results gathered in this work agree well with experimental data measured in the laboratory and other numerical simulations.
Earthquake damage detection in the Imperial County Services Building III: Analysis of wave travel times via impulse response functions
 The majority of structural health monitoring methods are based on detecting changes in the modal properties, which are global characteristics of the structure, and are not sensitive to local damage. Wave travel times between selected sections of a structure, on the other hand, are local characteristics, and are potentially more sensitive to local damage. In this paper, a structural health monitoring method based on changes in wave travel times is explored using strong motion data from the Imperial Valley Earthquake of 1979 recorded in the former Imperial County Services (ICS) Building, severely damaged by this earthquake. Wave travel times are measured from impulse response functions computed from the recorded horizontal seismic response in three time windows—before, during, and after the largest amplitude response, as determined from previous studies of this building, based on analysis of novelties in the recorded response. The results suggest initial spatial distribution of stiffness consistent with the design characteristics, and reduction of stiffness following the major damage consistent with the spatial distribution of the observed damage. The travel times were also used to estimate the fundamental fixed-base frequency of the structure f1 (assuming the building deformed as a shear beam), and its changes during this earthquake. These estimates are consistent with previous estimates of the soil–structure system frequency, fsys, during the earthquakes (f1<fsys as expected from soil–structure interaction studies), and with other estimates of frequency (f1 from ETABS models, and fsys from ambient vibration tests, and “instantaneous” f1 from high-frequency pulse propagation).
High Frequency Acoustic Sensor Dedicated to the High Resolution Measurement of Mechanical Properties
 Through acoustic signature, scanning acoustic microscopy can be used to quantify local mechanical properties of a medium thanks to the generation of surface waves, mostly Rayleigh waves. Despite being quite effective, this method requires to evaluate the mechanical properties of a single point the acquisition of many ultrasonic signals. This process is then time-consuming and is hardly adaptable to quantitative imaging. The solution considered in this paper to speed-up the method is to design a multi-element sensor allowing the extraction of information on Rayleigh waves with a reduced number of acquisitions. The work is conducted along two axes. As a first step, a model allowing the simulation of the acoustic wave behavior at a fluid/solid interface is developed. This model leads to a better understanding of the characterization of the mechanical properties and to the definition of an adapted sensor's design. As a second step, an experimental method for acoustic field reconstruction is used to characterize the multi-elements sensor and measurements of mechanical properties were done.
Wire-mesh sensors: A review of methods and uncertainty in multiphase flows relative to other measurement techniques
 Void fraction has always been an important parameter in the study of multiphase flows and its measurement has proven difficult over the years. This paper is a state of the art review of the application of conductivity based wire-mesh sensors (WMS) for the measurement of void fraction, bubble size, and gas fraction velocity in multiphase flows and their associated uncertainties. At this point in time there is no golden standard for void fraction measurement, so a large bulk of this work is on the uncertainty of the WMSs relative to other void fraction measurement methods, namely radiative methods. It is shown using the available data that the WMS have a void fraction measurement uncertainty of ±10.5% over a variety of flow regimes relative to other measurement methods. However, the accuracy of the instrument is largely based on its applicability to a particular flow. For example, the WMS is an excellent choice when entrapment in the sensor due to surface tension is minimized resulting in best results at higher flow rates compared to radiative methods. An assessment into the uncertainty of velocity and bubble size measurements is also performed: analyzing the current algorithms available and studies on these measurements in comparison with high speed cameras and ultrafast X-ray tomography. The current functioning form of the wire-mesh sensors were developed by Prasser in 1998 as a tomographic technique for the measurement of void fraction using a conductivity approach, as performed by earlier researchers. Later developments with the senors resulted in various techniques that allow for the measurement of velocity and interfacial area concentration.
Lamb wave-based blood coagulation test
 Blood coagulation tests are a critical part in diagnosis of patients with bleeding disorders and cardiovascular diseases. However, most conventional blood coagulation tests require large and expensive instruments and skilled personnel. Here, we present a simple and low-cost approach to evaluate blood coagulation using Lamb wave-based device. To assess coagulation, we monitored the acoustic streaming of 5 μm fluorescent particles suspended in citrated plasma. Using a Lamb wave, citrated blood plasma and coagulation reagents can be mixed in a few seconds and the viscosity of the droplet increases due to blood coagulation. Then, the acoustic streaming of particles eventually stops, at which the “coagulation time” is defined. As a preliminary test, coagulation time was reduced with increasing calcium concentration from 0 to 25 mM. Prothrombin time results from the Lamb wave-based device were validated by comparing with those of commercial instruments with the correlation coefficient (R2) as 0.9432. Using the Lamb wave for blood coagulation test, the temperature can be controlled as 37 °C simultaneously by modulating experimental conditions. Our device enables lithography-free, simple and low-cost measurement of blood coagulation, which can be applied to clinical settings and developing countries.
A hybrid FBG displacement and force sensor with a suspended and bent optical fiber configuration
 This paper has proposed a novel fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based hybrid displacement and force sensor with a compact structure and excellent resolution by using the transverse property of a tightly suspended and slightly bent optical fiber. The optical fiber, embedded with an FBG element, has been suspended with its ends fixed on the sensor frame and implemented with a pre-tension force by the displacement loading along its vertical direction to form a bent shape. A conversion mechanism has been designed to convert the displacement and force inputs into the transverse movement of different points along the suspended fiber. Experimental results show that the displacement sensitivity and force sensitivity are −219.69 pm/mm within the range of 0–2.5 mm and −345.2 pm/N with a high calculated resolution of 2.9 mN, respectively. Results from both the displacement and force experiments have illustrated a close agreement with values from commercial sensors.
Forward and Reverse Waves: Modeling Distortion Products in the Intracochlear Fluid Pressure
 Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are sounds that are emitted by the cochlea due to the nonlinearity of the outer hair cells. These emissions play an important role both in clinical settings and research laboratories. However, how distortion products propagate from their generation location to the middle ear remains unclear; whether distortion products propagate as a slow reverse traveling wave, or as a fast compression wave, through the cochlear fluid has been debated. In this article, we evaluate the contributions of the slow reverse wave and fast compression wave to the propagation of intracochlear distortion products using a physiologically based nonlinear model of the gerbil cochlea. This model includes a 3D two-duct model of the intracochlear fluid and a realistic model of outer hair cell biophysics. Simulations of the distortion products in the cochlear fluid pressure in response to a two-tone stimulus are compared with published in vivo experimental results. Whereas experiments have characterized distortion products at a limited number of locations, this model provides a complete description of the fluid pressure at all locations in the cochlear ducts. As in experiments, the spatial variations of the distortion products in the fluid pressure have some similarities with what is observed in response to a pure tone. Analysis of the fluid pressure demonstrates that although a fast wave component is generated, the slow wave component dominates the response. Decomposition of the model simulations into forward and reverse wave components shows that a slow forward propagating wave is generated due to the reflection of the slow reverse wave at the stapes. Wave interference between the reverse and forward components sometimes complicates the analysis of distortion products propagation using measurements at a few locations.
Simulating wave setup and runup during storm conditions on a complex barred beach
 The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the SWASH model to reproduce wave setup and runup in highly dissipative stormy conditions. To proceed we use data collected during the ECORS Truc Vert’08 Experiment, especially during the Johanna storm in the winter of 2007-008 (wave setup under Hs= 8.2 m and Tp= 18.3 s and runup under 6.4 m and peak period up to 16.4 s). We test different model settings (1D and 2D mode) and model forcing (spectral and parametric) to reproduce sensor measured wave setup at several locations in the nearshore area and video measured runup on two beach profiles. For the whole tested configurations, the wave setup is reproduced accurately. Results considering all the sensor locations in the near shore area in 1D and 2D are significantly correlated to the observations with respectively ρ²=0.66 and 0.81; RMSE=0.13 m and 0.08 m without any significant bias. Observations and simulations of runup are investigated in terms of spectra and statistic component. 1D simulations produces an overall overestimation and no significant improvement is obtained by modifying the breaking parameters. The results for 2D simulations are fairly satisfactory reproducing significant swash height (S), but are significantly improved with spectral forcing than parametric with respectively ρ²=0.73 and 0.71, RMSE=0.19 m and 0.43 m. Generally, the model reproduces accurately the infragravity component but tends to overestimate the incident component, leading to an overestimation of the energy density for moderate wave conditions and more accurate results for higher-energy wave conditions. Results in 2D with spectral forcing show a saturation of the infragravity component with a threshold around Hs=4 to 5 m, which is comparable to the observations collected at Truc Vert Beach. As regards the conventional statistical parameter for runup estimation (R2%) three methods are applied to derive the 2% exceedence value for runup from observed and simulated shoreline vertical elevation time series. When R2% is based on the sum of wave setup and half of the significant swash height, results provided by the model are close or even better than estimations provided by empirical formulas from the bibliography. Defining R2% as the exceeded 2% values of the time, derived considering the cumulative distribution function of the entire water-level time series also provide fairly good results. Results using only runup maxima time series are less satisfactory. In the two last cases, R2% is slightly underestimated for moderate wave conditions (Hs<4 m; Tp ≈ 14 s) and overestimated for higher-energy wave conditions. Generally results shows that where extreme wave conditions are concerned, the model setting must be considered carefully because the simplification of 1D (rather than 2D), or the use of parametric wave description (rather than spectral), can be a source of significant inaccuracy or overestimation in simulated run-up values.
Wireless sensor networks based smart bin
 This article presents the modelling of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to monitor unfilled level of bins through a central monitoring station and evaluation of wireless links. The nodes, called Wireless Monitoring Unit (WMU) are installed in each and every bins and the sensor present in the WMU measures the unfilled level of the bins and transmit the data to the Wireless Access Point Unit (WAPU). The WAPU receives data from the WMU's and sends the data to the central monitoring station and the level of the bins are monitored by using an application. The current consumption, life expectancy of WMU and WAPU, data transmission distance between WMU and WAPU, wireless link quality and the surface level attainment between the system reading and manual reading have been compared and studied. Based on the obtained results the identified system can be implemented eminently for solid waste management.
Laser Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) of nano-micro patterns for sensor applications
 The current research and market trends in sensor technologies require fast, low-cost processing, reliable and accurate deposition techniques for the fabrication of sensor devices, while there is a growing need for advanced integration complexity with reduced component size. Laser printing technology has progressed during the last few years not only in organic and flexible electronics but in sensors as well, owing to its unique advantages that include the high spatial resolution, the ability to transfer materials both in liquid and solid phase, the non-destructive approach of the deposition and the need for small volume solutions and waste fluids. This review article will focus on discussing the mechanisms of laser printing and specifically of the Laser Induced Forward Transfer technique, its origins and evolution providing examples on the applicability of the technique in sensor devices. Furthermore, a comparison with other printing techniques will be presented, aiming to provide a more complete view in the field of chemical and biological sensors.
Suomi NPP VIIRS/DNB imagery of nightglow gravity waves from various sources over China
 Observation of atmospheric gravity waves provides critical insight to weather and climate researches. Some gravity waves survive middle-atmospheric filtering as they propagate upward to the mesopause region and disturb the nightglow emission layer near 90 km AMSL, making the waves visible to both ground and space sensors. Based on the high-resolution images obtained by Day/Night Band on NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership environmental satellite, four representative gravity wave events over China are analyzed. With the help of VIIRS thermal infrared brightness temperature and MERRA wind data, we surmise that these waves originated from orography, thunderstorm, typhoon and baroclinic, respectively. Nadir viewing satellite observations cover a wide area and unlike the surface-based perspective, do not suffer from cloud obscuration. These new observations over remote areas provide important guidance for future deployment of ground based camera systems in China.
Trust-based security adaptation mechanism for Vehicular Sensor Networks
 Vehicular Sensor Networks (VSNs) are foreseen as a promising technology that can provide safe and reliable road travel in smart cities. By establishing pervasive connectivity among vehicles and infrastructure units on the road, various intelligent transport applications could be realized. Efficient network security for VSNs thus becomes a key challenge to reliably implement these applications. However, robust security techniques incur high security overhead and processing delays which significantly impact Quality of Service (QoS) particularly in a dense traffic scenario. In this paper, we propose a trust-based security adaptation mechanism to improve the QoS of safety applications in VSNs. The trust level is calculated using connectivity duration, security level and centrality metrics of nearby vehicles. The simulation results we have obtained with our proposed research shows an improvement of 25–65% in terms of safety awareness and 33–53% improvement in terms of packet inter-arrival time of safety applications in VSNs.
Integrating mesoscopic dynamic traffic assignment with agent-based travel behavior models for cumulative land development impact analysis
 A number of approaches have been developed to evaluate the impact of land development on transportation infrastructure. While traditional approaches are either limited to static modeling of traffic performance or lack a strong travel behavior foundation, today’s advanced computational technology makes it feasible to model an individual traveler’s response to land development. This study integrates dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) with a positive agent-based microsimulation travel behavior model for cumulative land development impact studies. The integrated model not only enhances the behavioral implementation of DTA, but also captures traffic dynamics. It provides an advanced yet practical approach to understanding the impact of a single or series of land development projects on an individual driver’s behavior, as well as the aggregated impacts on the demand pattern and time-dependent traffic conditions. A simulation-based optimization (SBO) approach is proposed for the calibration of the modeling system. The SBO calibration approach enhances the transferability of this integrated model to other study areas. Using a case study that focuses on the cumulative land development impact along a congested corridor in Maryland, various regional and local travel behavior changes are discussed to show the capability of this tool for behavior side estimations and the corresponding traffic impacts.
Compact Fiber Optic Trackside Sensor for Rail Vehicle Detection and Analysis
 The article describes a system for the trackside detection of rail vehicles based on the fiber-optic interferometer. Besides the phase sensitive distributed systems, the interferometers are the only fiberoptic sensing technology capable of working in indirect contact with the rail while offering similar functionality as track-mounted sensors. The proposed trackside sensor uses the balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The advantage of this type of interferometer is easy multiplexing, low cost and the possibility of flexible sensor design. The article describes the design of a sensor with multiple outputs of 3x3 coupler used for passive phase demodulation. The sensor has been tested on the railway track attached to the railway bridge. Results have shown that train operations can be reliably monitored using the developed system and it allows distinguishing the individual cars or wagon on the closer track.
Effect of shearing deformation on the transient response of a traveling wave ultrasonic motor
 Some works take into account the shearing deformation of frictional material, but its effect on the transient response has not yet been considered. In this paper, optimal deformation angle and resonance frequency of frictional material are investigated. Force expressions in the stator/rotor interface are developed. Mechanical characteristics taking into account the effect of shearing deformation are deduced and presented. It is shown that the shearing deformation affects the initial state as well as on the steady state. Also, the fast time response of the motor is deduced. Results of the simulation are validated using the measurements made by other researchers on traveling wave piezoelectric motor AWM90-X, Daimler-Benz type, and a prototype USM(AWM-90).
Optimization of the frequency-modulated continuous wave technique for referencing and multiplexing intensity-based fiber optic sensors
 In this paper, we demonstrate the interrogation of fiber optic intensity sensors by using the combination of the frequency-modulated continuous wave concept with the spectral selective reflectivity of fiber Bragg gratings. Thus, we multiplex these kinds of sensors with this technique having simultaneously a referenced system. The basis of this dual functionality is described and results are presented for the case of interrogation of two multiplexed intensity sensors. Their evaluation permits to establish the conditions to address a sensor network of this type. Also, it is proposed a strategy to implement this sensing approach without the requirement of using optical fiber delay lines in the sensor heads.
Velocity characteristics in boundary layer flow caused by solitary wave traveling over horizontal bottom
 The characteristics of horizontal velocity in the bottom boundary-layer flow induced by a solitary wave propagating over a horizontal bottom are presented experimentally, using high-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV). The ratio of wave height to water depth varies from 0.096 to 0.386 and the flow inside the boundary layer is laminar. The results show that the horizontal velocity profiles can be mainly classified into two categories with respect to the passing of the solitary wave-crest at the measuring section: the pre-passing (or acceleration) phases under favorable pressure gradient and post-passing (or deceleration) phases under adverse pressure gradient. For the velocity distributions obtained during the pre-passing phases, a nonlinear regression analysis was used to precisely determine the time-dependent characteristic length and velocity scales underlying these profiles. A similarity profile of the horizontal velocity is established first using the time-dependent free-stream velocity and boundary layer thickness as the characteristic velocity and length scales, respectively. In addition, the displacement thickness, the momentum thickness, and the energy thickness are also considered as alternative length scales. All these four representative thicknesses are closely related to each other, demonstrating that any one amongst them can be regarded as the characteristic length scale. The forms of similarity profiles for the non-dimensional velocity distributions are somewhat analogous to the results of steady boundary layer flow over a thin plate under with pressure gradient, but with different coefficients or powers. While during the post-passing phases, flow reversal which acts like an unsteady wall jet and moves in the opposite direction against the wave propagation occurs after the passage of solitary wave-crest. The thickness of flow reversal layer increases with time. A similarity profile is proposed for the velocity distributions corresponding to occurrence of the extreme value in the maximum negative velocity of flow reversal. Variations of the maximum negative velocity and the thickness of flow reversal with the time right after the start of flow reversal are also discussed in detail. Moreover, the non-dimensional time leads of the horizontal velocities at different heights in the boundary layer over the free-stream velocity are evidenced to be more noticeable toward the bottom, and also in lower ratio of wave height to water depth. A similarity profile for the non-dimensional time lead versus the non-dimensional height above the bottom surface is also presented.
Correcting wave reflection estimates in the coastal zone
 The impact of random noise on an existing two-dimensional method for separating incident and reflected wave spectra using an array of wave gauges is investigated using simulated time series with known wave amplitudes, reflection coefficients, and signal-to-noise ratios. Both the incident and reflected spectra are overestimated by a quantity that can exceed 100% for signal-to-noise ratios less than 1. Consequently, estimated reflection coefficients are also overestimated with larger errors occurring when the known reflection is low. Coherence decreases systematically with increasing noise and this trend is used to develop a mathematical function to correct for the observed bias and provide 95% confidence intervals for incident and reflected spectra and reflection coefficients. The correction technique is shown to be very effective in reducing error by up to ~90%. Field data from a natural beach are used to demonstrate the application of these results; corrected values suggest that reflection coefficients are frequently overestimated by over 50%.
Fiber-Optic Sensors
 This chapter covers fiber-optic sensors for structural health monitoring (SHM) of aerospace composites. The general principles of fiber-optic technology and the major fiber-optic sensing principles (intensity modulation, polarization modulation, phased modulation, spectral modulation, scattering modulation) are presented. The Fabry–Perot (FB) and other interferometers are discussed. Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) optical sensors, their conditioning equipment, and the demodulation methods for ultrasonic frequencies are discussed. Examples include: tunable FB filters, tunable narrow-linewidth laser sources, chirped FB filters, array waveguide grating (AWG), two-wave mixing photorefractive crystal (PRC), etc. FBG rosettes, long-gage FBG sensors, and temperature compensation of FBG sensors are also discussed. Intensity-modulated fiber-optic sensors (e.g., IBOF sensors) are mentioned. Distributed optical fiber sensing principles based on optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) including both Brillouin OTDR and Rayleigh backscatter OTDR methods are discussed. Fiber-optic temperature laser radar (FTR), triboluminescence optical sensors, and polarimetric optical sensors are also mentioned.
Longitudinal and transverse wave propagation analysis of stationary and axially moving carbon nanotubes conveying nano-fluid
 In this study, the longitudinal and transverse wave propagation of the stationary and the axially moving carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with and without inside flowing fluid are investigated and analyzed. For this purpose, the nano-rod model for the longitudinal vibration and the Euler–Bernoulli beam model for the transverse vibration are utilized in order to modeling of the stationary CNT. Furthermore, the Rayleigh beam model is employed for modeling the axially moving CNT. In addition, for considering the nano-scale effects of the structure and fluid flowing through carbon nanotubes, the nonlocal elasticity theory and the Knudsen number are utilized, respectively, and their effects on the system wave frequency and phase velocity are investigated. Moreover, complex-valued wave dispersion relations and corresponding characteristic equations are derived according to the wave frequency, phase velocity, and the wave number. The results show that the axial velocity of the CNT has more effective role than the flowing fluid velocity for dispersed wave magnitude and intensification of the frequency, especially for the longitudinal dispersion. It is observed that the phase velocity is decreased by increasing the wave number on both longitudinal and transverse wave propagation.
An integrated electro-optic magnetic field sensor based on reflected Mach-Zehnder interferometer
 An optical magnetic field sensor using reflective Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) integrated optical waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) has been proposed, designed and fabricated. The bare chip size of the sensor is microminiaturized as small as 20 × 5 × 0.5 mm3. Experiment results reveal that the sensor has wide frequency response from 10 MHz to 2 GHz with variation less than ±3.3 dB. Besides, the input/output of the sensor exhibit linear relationship as the magnetic field varied from 69.4 dBμA/m to 129.4 dBμA/m. The minimum detectable magnetic field is 65.4 dBμA/m and the dynamic range of the sensor is more than 60 dB.
On the temporal analysis of acoustic waves using schlieren imaging
 The primary objective of the present study was to develop a quantitative schlieren-imaging technique that can be used to study the dynamics of instability waves. The technique was initially validated by optically capturing a controlled acoustic wave generated by a compression driver and excellent agreement was obtained with microphone measurements. An underexpanded jet was considered as an ideal test case due to the complexity and multitude of instability mechanism. Further analysis of the underexpanded jet demonstrated that this technique can be used to capture the very high frequency mode related to the phenomenon of screech.

Detectability of corrosion damage with circumferential guided waves in reflection and transmission
 There is an increasing interest in high frequency short range guided waves to screen or monitor for corrosion. This contrasts with long range guided waves (LRGWs) which screen pipes for large patches of corrosion and have been successfully used in corrosion management for the past twenty years. The fundamental setup described in this paper uses circumferential guided waves, which are excited at a single location on a pipe and travel around the pipe wall and are detected at the same location. The study uses a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capability of two short range circumferential guided wave setups which use both the reflected and transmitted signals. The setups themselves consist of either an axial array of transducers, for monitoring, or a single transducer which axially scans a pipe. Both setups have an array or scan pitch between either adjacent transducers or measurements. The detection capability of the fundamental Lamb wave modes (A0 and S0) in both reflection and transmission have been compared, as well as a hybrid shear horizontal wave setup, which uses the SH0 mode in reflection and the SH1 mode in transmission. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using two separate methods to determine the probability of detection (POD) for either the reflection or transmission signals. Both methods determine a POD for a specific defect, noise level, and array or scan pitch. Probability images are produced which map the POD for a range of defect sizes. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that in transmission large diameter defects have a higher detectability, whereas deep, narrow diameter defects are more detectable in reflection. A generalised overview of the sensitivity of short range guided waves is presented by combining both the reflection and transmission PODs. The data fused sensitivity of the S0 and SH hybrid modes are given as 0.6% and 0.75% cross sectional area (CSA) respectively, allowing for the comparison with LRGWs. The A0 mode was excluded from the POD analysis because it was much less sensitive than the other two modes.
Reproduction of steep long crested irregular waves with CFD using the VOF method
 The present paper aims to reproduce an extreme event extracted from an experimental time series relative to 2D long crested irregular waves. The experimental values are relative to the wave tank experiments at 1:80 scale, carried out on a stiff monopile within the Waveloads project. The monopile, modeled as a cylinder of constant diameter, is placed on a 1:25 slope and irregular waves are generated at the inlet with a mechanical paddle. In order to reproduce the time series and the consequent loads on the structure, a reconstruction of the wave elevation using a super position of 1st order components is done, the components are then imported to the aero-servo-elastic code 3Dfloat and the wave kinematics at the inlet for the computation fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are obtained using 1st order formulation. Successively, the kinematics are imported as boundary conditions into the CFD commercial code STAR-CCM+. The free surface is modelled with the volume of fluid formulation and the k-ω turbulence model with the Menter formulation is used. In the experiments, a monopile of 0.75cm diameter (6m in full scale) is placed a distance of 7.75m (600m in full scale) from the inlet. The water depth at the model is 0.26cm (20m in full scale). Two different wave events of 25s extracted from two different time series are reproduced and compared with the experiments. The simulated wave elevation is measured at different locations and compared with the experiments. Good agreement between the simulations and the experiments is found.
Detection of delamination in composite laminates using Lamb wave based nonlinear method
 In this study, a Lamb wave based nonlinear method is used to detect delamination in a composite laminate. For this purpose, an artificial delamination is created in a composite laminate using a thin Teflon sheet. The research includes an experimental study as well as finite element simulation. Two higher harmonics are observed in the Lamb wave response as a result of contact nonlinearity at the delamination. A spectral damage index is extracted from the spectral information of the fundamental and higher harmonics. It is found to be invariant to the sensor location and its values show decreasing trend with increase in the delamination width. Further, a new hybrid method is introduced, wherein the spectral and temporal data are used together in order to locate a delamination.
LAICE CubeSat mission for gravity wave studies
 The Lower Atmosphere/Ionosphere Coupling Experiment (LAICE) CubeSat mission will focus on understanding the interaction of atmospheric gravity waves generated by weather systems in the lower atmosphere with the mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere (MLTI). Specifically, LAICE will focus on the energy and momentum delivered by these waves and attempt to connect the wave sources and the wave effects in three widely different altitude ranges, substantially adding to our knowledge of critical coupling processes between disparate atmospheric regions. The LAICE mission consists of a 6U CubeSat with a four-instrument payload. The retarding potential analyzer (RPA) will provide in-situ ion density and temperature measurements. A four-channel photometer will measure density and temperature variations in the mesosphere through observations of O2 (0, 0) Atmospheric band and O2 Herzberg I band airglows. There are two pressure sensors that comprise the Space Pressure Suite (SPS): the Space Neutral Pressure Instrument (SNeuPI) and the LAICE Ionization gauge Neutral Atmosphere Sensor (LINAS). Both will provide neutral density measurements, but SNeuPI is a prototype sensor that will be validated by LINAS. This CubeSat mission, scheduled for launch in early 2016 from the International Space Station, provides a cost-effective approach to measuring low altitude in-situ parameters along with simultaneous imaging that is capable of addressing the fundamental questions of atmospheric gravity wave coupling in the MLTI region.
Numerical analysis of tsunami-like wave impact on horizontal cylinders
 During the past few decades, several tsunami events have caused tremendous devastation to onshore and offshore infrastructures. Although the tsunami waves have been studied with solitary waves since 1970s, the wave profile differences between solitary and tsunami waves directly result in the significant differences in their energy carrying capability and potential destructive impacts. In this study, a tsunami-like wave profile has been adopted by using a composition of solitary waves to simulate a real tsunami wave profile. A two-phase flow model was numerically resolved with the finite volume method with the volume of fluid method to track the free surface. The numerical model was first validated against the experimental and theoretical studies with the solitary wave. And then, the impact of tsunami waves at submerged horizontal cylinders was numerically studied. The hydrodynamic differences between the solitary wave and tsunami-like wave passing the submerged cylinders have been discussed, which shows the significant differences on the punching forces and the velocity field evolution around the cylinders. Moreover, the effects of wave height and submersion depth on the hydrodynamic loads were considered, and the influence of the spacing distance on the interactions between cylinders in a tandem arrangement was also investigated.
Reliable sensor location for object positioning and surveillance via trilateration
 Object positioning and surveillance has been playing an important role in various indoor location-aware applications. Signal attenuation or blockage often requires multiple local sensors to be used jointly to provide coverage and determine object locations via mobile devices. The deployment of sensors has a significant impact on the accuracy of positioning and effectiveness of surveillance. In this paper, we develop a reliable sensor location model that aims at optimizing the location of sensors so as to maximize the accuracy of object positioning/surveillance under the risk of possible sensor disruptions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and develop solution approaches based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm with an embedded approximation subroutine. A series of hypothetical examples and a real-world Wi-Fi access point design problem for Chicago O’Hare Airport Terminal 5 are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model and solution algorithms. Managerial insights are also presented.
A benchmark facility for guided elastic wave actuation by piezoelectric discs
 Key aspects of piezoelectric actuation of circular-crested guided elastic waves (ccGEW) in homogeneous plates are investigated experimentally and studied with finite element analysis (FEA). The specific implementation of fiber-optic strain transduction presented offers virtually distortion-free conversion of radial GEW displacements with a flat transfer characteristic and negligible interference with the wave to be studied. Due to a concentric arrangement of actuator disc, fiber-optic transducer and circular plate, a shuttling GEW pulse packet can be retained over an exceptionally long period of time. Hence accurate long term measurements of the excited surface strain in response to piezoelectrical actuation becomes feasible for specific GEW modes. Presumably, traveling-wave-like behavior of compressional ccGEW pulses including the transition of converging into expanding wave packets around the symmetry axis is observed for the first time. Minor deviations between FEA predictions and measurement results can be traced back to imperfections of the experimental setup or inaccurate material data. The presented approach may be used for thorough characterization of piezoelectric disc actuators and studies of ccGEW propagation in various homogeneous materials.
Modeling and simulation of polarization errors in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor
 Sagnac fiber optic current sensor (S-FOCS) is a kind of optical interferometer based on Sagnac structure, optical polarization states of sensing light wave in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor are limited. However, several factors induce optical polarization error, and non-ideal polarized light waves cause the interference signal crosstalk in sensor, including polarizer, quarter-wave retarder, splice angular, birefringence and so on. With these errors, linearly polarized light wave in PM fiber and circularly polarized light wave in sensing fiber become elliptically polarized light wave, then, nonreciprocal phase shift induced by magnetic field of the current is interrupted by wrong polarization state. To clarify characteristics of optical polarization error in fiber optic current sensor, we analyze the evolution process of random optical polarization state, linear optical polarization state and circular optical polarization state in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor by using Poincare sphere, then, build optical polarization error models by using Jones matrix. Based on models of polarization state in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor, we investigate the influence of several main error factors on optical polarization error characteristics theoretically, including extinction ratio in polarizer, phase delay in quarter-wave retarder, splice angular between quarter-wave retarder and polarization maintaining fiber. Finally, we simulate and quantify nonreciprocal phase shift to be detected in fiber optic current sensor related with optical polarization errors. In the end, we demonstrate S-FOCS in test. The results show that transfer matrix errors are induced by inaccurate polarization properties during polarization state conversion, then, the stability and accuracy of the S-FOCS are affected, and it is important to control the polarization properties at each step of the polarization state conversion precisely.
Characterization of 3-D wave flow regimes on falling liquid films
 Experimental study of wave evolution on the surface of isothermal liquid films falling down vertical plate conducted by means of field measuring system has revealed three typical scenarios of the evolution in the range of low and moderate liquid flow rates. At low liquid flow rates transverse modulation of 2D waves develops without formation of 3D waves. Two dimensional waves break up into 3D waves only when Reynolds number Re of the film flow exceeds some threshold value which depends on physical properties of working fluid. The fully developed steady-state 3D wave regimes are observed when Re exceeds another threshold value. The obtained results allow to determine the boundaries within which the adequate comparison between modeling and experiments on 3D wave flow of liquid films is possible.
The influence of swash-based reflection on surf zone hydrodynamics: a wave-by-wave approach
 A detailed understanding of the behaviour of waves in the nearshore is essential for coastal engineers as these waves cause beach erosion, coastal flooding and damage to coastal structures. Significantly, the influence of reflected waves is often neglected in surf zone studies, although they are known to influence wave properties and circulation in the nearshore. In this paper, a phase-resolving model is rigorously applied to model conditions from the prototype-scale BARDEXII experiment in order to examine and assess the influence of swash-based reflection on surf zone hydrodynamics at both the individual wave and time-averaged timescales. Surface elevation is separated into incoming and outgoing signals using the Radon Transform and a crest tracking algorithm is used to extract incident and reflected wave properties. It is found that on steep beaches (tanβ>1:9) the swash-based reflection - the reflection generated in the swash during the backwash - contributes significantly to the intrawave variability of individual wave properties such as the wave height to water depth ratio γ, through the generation of quasi-nodes/antinodes system. For γ expressed with individual wave heights, variations up to 25% and 40% are obtained for the modelled regular and irregular wave tests, whereas it reaches 15% when it is based on the significant wave height. The outgoing wave field-induced hydrodynamics is also found to affect time-averaged parameters: undertow and horizontal velocity skewness. The undertow is mainly strengthened, particularly in the shoaling region where the outgoing component dominates over the contribution from the incoming wave field. Offshore of the bar, an onshore-directed flow streaming close to the bed is also generated under the outgoing wave field, and is suspected to help in stabilising the bar position. This, along with the influence of the outgoing wave field on the horizontal velocity skewness and the presence of quasi-standing waves, suggests a complex contribution of the hydrodynamics induced by swash-based reflection into sediment transport rates and nearshore bar generation/migration.
A nonlinear weakly dispersive method for recovering the elevation of irrotational surface waves from pressure measurements
 We present the derivation of a nonlinear weakly dispersive formula to reconstruct, from pressure measurements, the surface elevation of nonlinear waves propagating in shallow water. The formula is simple and easy to use as it is local in time and only involves first and second order time derivatives of the measured pressure. This novel approach is evaluated on laboratory and field data of shoaling waves near the breaking point. Unlike linear methods, the nonlinear formula is able to reproduce at the individual wave scale the peaked and skewed shape of nonlinear waves close to the breaking point. Improvements in the frequency domain are also observed as the new method is able to accurately predict surface wave elevation spectra over four harmonics. The nonlinear weakly dispersive formula derived in this paper represents an economic and easy to use alternative to direct wave elevation measurement methods (e.g. acoustic surface tracking and LiDAR scanning).
Travelling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator using an ultra-compliant alternator for utilization of low-grade thermal energy
 This paper proposes a novel concept of a travelling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator, which employs a looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine to convert thermal energy into acoustic power, an ultra-compliant alternator within the engine loop to extract and convert the engine acoustic power to electricity and an acoustic stub matching technique to match the alternator to the engine. In addition, a carefully designed cold heat exchanger acts as a phase shifting inertance to improve the performance. A simple model has been developed to capture and demonstrate the physics of this new concept, while the whole system has been investigated in detail numerically by using a specialized design tool DeltaEC. Based on the current concept, a prototype has been designed, constructed and tested. It uses atmospheric air as the working fluid, a commercially available audio loudspeaker as the electro-dynamic transducer, and inexpensive standard parts as the acoustic resonator. The experimental results have verified the simplified model and the numerical simulations of the practical build. The small-scale inexpensive prototype generator produced 11.6 W of electrical power, which shows the potential for developing cheap thermoacoustic electricity generators for energy recovery from waste heat sources. It is concluded that such concept could be very attractive provided that inexpensive ultra-compliant alternators based on the standard technology used in audio loudspeakers could be developed. Finally, some guidelines have been discussed and proposed for developing such alternators.
Wireless sensor network in landslide monitoring system with remote data management
 This paper describes a system that uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) to monitor landslide disasters in remote areas. The system consists of 3 subsystems called the Local Sensing Node Network System (LSNNS), the Cloud System (CS), and the Host System (HS). To monitor the field status and condition of the nodes remotely, we set up an appropriate management scheme in which the HS collects various data types in categories: node status, node data, LSNNS status, and LSNNS data. Equivalent lists are available to manage the HS and CS. Each data type contributes to 1 or 2 key analyses in determining a temporary situation. Experiments are conducted to investigate some featured data for landslide monitoring application, including node posture, dynamic change of topology, landslide occurrence recognition, and node location change. Where WSN is a candidate for monitoring natural disasters, this remote management scheme provides the surveillance process with extra information and helps the operator to comprehend the situation and maneuver with less effort.
Effect of CO2 on P- and S-wave velocities at seismic and ultrasonic frequencies
 Time-lapse seismic is a widely used technology for monitoring the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2), consisting of mapping its movement in the subsurface and of demonstrating that the CO2 is safely stored in the reservoir (Xue and Ohsumi, 2004). In this work, the effect of CO2 on P- and S-wave velocities was investigated. Laboratory measurements were performed with Castlegate sandstone both at seismic frequencies (1–155 Hz), and at ultrasonic frequency (around 500 kHz). Different CO2 saturations between 2% and 10% were obtained by controlled depressurization of CO2-saturated water with which the sandstone sample had been saturated with. At seismic frequencies, the results of the experiments revealed that P-wave velocity is strongly reduced in the presence of free gas CO2 in the pore space, whereas at ultrasonic frequency, the P-wave velocity changed only slightly. Therefore, the presence of free CO2 gas increased significantly the P-wave dispersion between seismic and ultrasonic frequencies. The S-wave velocity, on the other hand, was hardly affected by the pore fluid at seismic frequencies. At seismic frequencies, P- and S-wave velocities were consistent with the Biot–Gassmann model. The P-wave velocity dispersion and corresponding attenuation were simulated by applying the Cole–Cole model. The transition frequency was found around 200 kHz.
An improved solid boundary treatment for wave–float interactions using ISPH method
 The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has proved to have great potentials in dealing with the wave-structure interactions. Compared with the Weakly Compressible SPH (WCSPH) method, the ISPH approach solves the pressure by using the pressure Poisson equation rather than the equation of state. This could provide a more stable and accurate pressure field that is important in the study of wave-structure interactions. This paper improves the solid boundary treatment of ISPH by using a high accuracy Simplified Finite Difference Interpolation (SFDI) scheme for the 2D wave-structure coupling problems, especially for free-moving structure. The proposed method is referred as the ISPH_BS. The model improvement is demonstrated by the documented benchmark tests and laboratory experiment covering various wave-structure interaction applications.
Internal Gravity Waves☆
 The ocean's interior is filled with waves that can only exist because the ocean is vertically stratified in temperature and salinity. Like waves at the ocean surface, internal waves are restored by gravity. These internal gravity waves are generated by wind, tides, and low-frequency flows. As internal waves propagate through the ocean, they interact with low-frequency background flows, topography, and other waves, facilitating an energy cascade to smaller scales, and eventually turbulence. The turbulent mixing is relevant for the general ocean circulation, impacting climate and the dispersion of tracers, like nutrients. In recent decades, the quality of observations and numerical simulations of internal wave processes, and their interpretation, has improved significantly, leading to rapid advances in internal wave research.
Damage characterization of composite plates under low velocity impact using ultrasonic guided waves
 In this work, two numerical procedures based on Finite Elements Method (FEM) have been developed in order to simulate the Lamb wave propagation in Low Velocity Impact (LVI) damaged CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) laminate. The former (softening representation), usually adopted in literature, consists of modelling LVI damages by lowering the elastic material properties which allowed investigating the Lamb wave propagation at different stages of LVI damages evolution. The latter, proposed in this paper, conversely to the first one and the most of techniques presented in literature, consists of simulating Lamb wave propagation in a plate characterized by an initial stress-strain state and the related failures carried out by a previous impact simulation involving the same model. Such technique allows a better damage modelling and, consequently, overcoming the damage modelling approximations introduced by the former strategy; the lowering of the elastic material properties leads to a bad damage modelling which does not allow reproducing accurately what happens in the reality. Such procedure allowed investigating the Lamb wave propagation at different impact energy levels. The interaction between Lamb waves and damages has been investigated under three central frequencies of the actuation signal: 150 kHz, 200 kHz and 250 kHz which resulted in interesting observations to minimize the effect of the first lamina's fibres orientation on the wave propagation velocity. It is well known that different wave propagation velocities along fibres and matrix lead to different RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) damage index values, even if the sensors are mounted at the same distance from the damage location, resulting in wrong or less accurate information about the identification of both damage size and location during the post-processing phase. Moreover, the relationships between the RMSD damage index values, recorded at different instants of time of the impact history, and the impactor phases has been achieved. Finally a comparison between the results achieved by the two investigated strategies has been carried out and presented here.
Bus travel time prediction using a time-space discretization approach
 The accuracy of travel time information given to passengers plays a key role in the success of any Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) application. In order to improve the accuracy of such applications, one should carefully develop a prediction method. A majority of the available prediction methods considered the variation in travel time either spatially or temporally. The present study developed a prediction method that considers both temporal and spatial variations in travel time. The conservation of vehicles equation in terms of flow and density was first re-written in terms of speed in the form of a partial differential equation using traffic stream models. Then, the developed speed based equation was discretized using the Godunov scheme and used in the prediction scheme that was based on the Kalman filter. From the results, it was found that the proposed method was able to perform better than historical average, regression, and ANN methods and the methods that considered either temporal or spatial variations alone. Finally, a formulation was developed to check the effect of side roads on prediction accuracy and it was found that the additional requirement in terms of location based data did not result in an appreciable change in the prediction accuracy. This clearly demonstrated that the proposed approach based on using vehicle tracking data is good enough for the considered application of bus travel time prediction.
Detecting damaged reinforcement bars in concrete structures using guided waves
 Many engineering structures must be inspected or monitored throughout their serviceable life to ensure their safe operation. In the case of reinforced concrete structures, the most common cause of premature failure is corrosion of the steel reinforcement bars that must be pre-empted. Modal based techniques are popular, since they can potentially detect damage using sensors placed remotely from the damage site. However, changes in modal parameters due to damage can be masked by their sensitivity to environmental factors and changes to the boundary conditions that are unrelated to damage. In this respect, wave based techniques provide a potential alternative. In this paper, wave propagation is modelled in a damaged steel reinforced concrete beam. The damaged section is modelled in conventional finite elements and this is coupled to wave finite element models (WFE) of the undamaged sections on either side. This hybrid modelling approach facilitates a wave based analysis of a one dimensional structure with potentially geometrically complex damage. A numerical case study is presented for a locally damaged beam represented by a loss of thickness of one reinforcement bar. It is shown that some wave modes, that feature deformation of the cross section, exhibit a strong reflection close to their cut-on frequency. This is due to the difference in cut-on frequency between the damaged and undamaged sections. A damage detection method is outlined in which the amplitudes of incident and reflected waves of low wave number are compared. No a priori knowledge of the dispersion curves is necessary. In numerical simulations, a reduction in the ratio of the reflected to incident wave amplitudes is seen in the vicinity of cut-on frequencies.
Evaluation of ultrasonic sensor for variable-rate spray applications
 Automatic variable-rate sprayers require accurate measurement of canopy size. An estimate of canopy size is made by measuring the distance to the canopy at several elevations above the ground; an ultrasonic sensor was used to determine canopy distance in this study. It is sometimes necessary to conduct spray operations during harsh operating conditions. In this study ultrasonic sensors were subjected to simulated environmental and operating conditions to determine their durability and accuracy. Conditions tested included exposure to extended cold, outdoor temperatures, cross winds, temperature change, dust clouds, travel speeds and spray cloud effects. The root mean square (RMS) error in a series of measurements of the distance to a simulated plant canopy was used to test for significant difference among treatments. After exposure to outdoor cold conditions for 4 months, the RMS error in distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor increased from 3.31 to 3.55 cm, which was not statistically significant. Neither the presence of dust cloud nor the changes in cross-wind speeds over a range from 1.5–7.5 m/s had significant effects on the mean RMS errors. Varying sensor travel speed from 0.8 to 3.0 m/s had no significant influence on sensor detection distances. Increasing ambient temperature from 16.7 to 41.6 °C reduced the detection distance by 5.0 cm. The physical location of the spray nozzle with respect to the ultrasonic sensor had a significant effect on mean RMS errors. The mean RMS errors of sensor distance measurements ranged from 2.3 to 83.0 cm. The RMS errors could be reduced to acceptable values by proper controlling the sensor/spray nozzles spacing on a sprayer. In addition, multiple-synchronized sensors were tested for their measurement stability and accuracy (due to possible cross-talk errors) when mounted on a prototype sprayer. It was found that isolating the pathway of the ultrasonic wave of each sensor reduced detecting interference between sensors during multiple sensor operation. Test methods presented herein may be useful in the design of standardized testing protocols for field use distance sensors.
Estimating the ratio between travelling and standing vibration waves under non-stationary conditions
 This paper presents a new method of spatially decomposing vibration patterns in real time into their travelling and standing parts. This method creates a localized parametric model describing the nature of the developed vibrations leading to a scalar measure of the travelling to standing waves ratio. Despite being rather simple compared with spatial Fourier transform that yields space-averaged results, the current method seems superior for a localized description. Due to its superior localization, the decomposition conveys important insight and valuable information for vibrating structures that can be used for identification, diagnosis and for control purposes of ultrasonic motors and rotating discs. Several features make the proposed method advantageous over existing schemes, in particular when the number of deployed sensors is small and confined to a small region. It is shown that the presented approach differs from the commonly used Fourier-based methods in several ways: (a) the proposed method does not require equally distributed sensors and does not require a spatially complete coverage of the analyzed domain nor does it require equally spaced sensing elements; (b) the algorithm makes neither use of the spatial wavelength nor requires its estimate to curve-fit the instantaneous spatial deformation patterns; (c) the method is most suitable for cases where a localized pattern needs to be estimated and is therefore robust to imperfections in the vibrating structure; (d) the presented formulation has a recursive form that is suitable for real-time implementations by a digital signal processor.
Field measurements of surface waves using a 5-beam ADCP
 This study examines the performance of an improved 5-beam ADCP, with a vertical beam, when deployed to measure non-directional waves in waters of 40 m depth. To assess the performance, the ADCP is compared with four co-located directional wave buoys. The surface elevation spectra as measured by the vertical beam compare well with estimates from the buoys in the range 0.10–0.35 Hz. Except for peak period, spectral estimates of wave height, mean energy period and spectral bandwidth from the vertical beam agree well with estimates from the buoys, showing only small differences of 2–7%. Some cases exist where either the ADCP or the buoys can resolve particular wave systems that the other sensor cannot resolve, though some of these instances may be the result of numerical artefact. At low frequencies, the ADCP shows a better sensitivity to swell components, and though the buoys can produce low frequency peaks, the difference between the two sensors is particularly evident during low energy sea states. At high frequencies, both sensors may show susceptibility to noise. The study intends to increase the level of confidence in using a 5-beam ADCP with a vertical beam, and of its comparative performance with a different wave sensor.
Celerities of waves and ice runs from ice jam releases
 The release of a river ice jam can lead to rapidly rising water levels and a fast-moving torrent of water and ice that can threaten riverside communities. Two phases are released when an ice jam fails: a water wave and a moving ice accumulation (called an “ice run”). The propagation of the water component of an ice jam release wave is relatively well understood. However, a dearth of simultaneous observations of both the water and ice components of an ice jam release has hampered the development of tools to predict of the effects of these releases. This paper presents a field experiment on the Hay River in the Northwest Territories where both water level and ice condition were observed simultaneously at several locations over a distance of more than ten thousand flow depths. This research shows that the water wave and the ice run travel at different celerities resulting in two distinct, but initially overlapping, features. The celerity of the leading edge of the water wave was found to be higher than the ice components, making the water wave move out in front of the ice after 4 to 8 ice jam lengths of travel.
Sensor Technologies
 This chapter explains the different physical principles and technologies that are used in various types of measurement sensors. As well as summarizing the background theory, the different measurement sensors that use each principle are reviewed. The recent development of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices and nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) devices is also discussed in some detail. The chapter starts with a discussion on capacitive sensors and then moves on to resistive sensors. Following this, the various magnetic sensors in the form of variable inductance, variable reluctance, eddy current, and Hall effect devices are reviewed. This is followed by three sections that cover piezoelectric transducers, strain gauges, and piezoresistive sensors, respectively. The next subject of discussion is optical sensors, which can exist in both open air path and fiber optic forms. In the case of the latter, both intrinsic and extrinsic fiber optic sensors are discussed and the fundamental difference between the two types is explained. Following this, ultrasonic sensors are considered in both transit time and Doppler shift forms. Then, after a brief look at nuclear sensors, the chapter finishes with a discussion on microsensors (MEMS and NEMS devices).
Study of a liquid-piston traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engine with different working gases
 Thermoacoustic technology is becoming increasingly attractive because of its high reliability and environmental friendliness. The double-acting traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engine using liquid pistons, proposed by our group, can improve the thermoacoustic conversion efficiency further and yield a more compact engine. In this study, three different environmentally friendly working gases, helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, were studied experimentally, primarily in terms of thermoacoustic conversion parameters, including the onset temperature, the resonant frequency, and the pressure ratio, under different working mean pressures. Results show that the working gas significantly influences thermoacoustic performance. They also suggest a very encouraging application prospect for this novel thermoacoustic heat engine. Finally, we performed theoretical analysis to better understand thermoacoustic conversion with the different working gases.
Coverage in mobile wireless sensor networks (M-WSN): A survey
 A mobile wireless sensor network (M-WSN) consists of sensors equipped with locomotive platforms to allow movement after initial deployment. M-WSNs are useful for environments that are difficult and/or dangerous for sensor deployment. A key challenge in sensor networks deployment is to ensure that deployed sensors provide the required coverage for the area of interest, while ensuring connectivity of the deployed network. Sensor coverage and connectivity problems were investigated thoroughly in the literature for various types of WSNs, and several techniques were proposed with various capability and limitations. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive classification and categorization for the various techniques and algorithms used in M-WSNs for enhancing coverage after initial deployment, and for maintaining coverage after node failure. We present a mathematical formulation for each coverage type, and survey and analyze approaches proposed in the literature to maintain coverage in each type in the context of M-WSN.
Optimization of interdigital transducers for the generation of surface acoustic waves over a large bandwidth (20–125 MHz)
 In this paper, wideband interdigital transducers (IDT) to excite surface acoustic waves (SAW) have been developed and optimized. Three spatial chirp configurations were studied in order to cover a large bandwidth ranging from 20 to 125 MHz with sufficiently large displacement amplitudes to enable the characterization of surfaces (structures, thin layers, coatings, etc.). It is shown that by optimizing the configuration of the spatial distribution (width and spacing) of the electrodes, it is possible to adapt the spectral distribution of the SAW generated and to obtain a desired spectrum over the entire range of over 100 MHz. Finally, it is shown that high frequency attenuation of SAW can be overcome thanks to an additional optimization of the IDT by emitting more energy at high frequencies. It is thus possible with these transducers to measure displacements of the surface acoustic waves propagating along distances greater than 20 mm.
Modeling and performance evaluation of traveling-wave piezoelectric ultrasonic motors with analytical method
 A new analytical model for traveling-wave piezoelectric ultrasonic motors (TWUSM) is developed and experimentally verified in this study. The proposed model consists of two parts: one is for modeling mechanical vibrations of the stator with forced vibration equations, and the other is for modeling the contact between the stator and the rotor with consideration of the stick-slip behavior. The mechanical characteristic of the proposed model, with various control variables and constructional parameters, are investigated in simulations and experiments conducted on a self-manufactured motor prototype. It is shown that experimental results are in good agreement with simulation results, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model.
Estimating vehicle speed with embedded inertial sensors
 Pavements were instrumented with inertial sensors, and the possibility of estimating the speed of a passing vehicle was investigated numerically and experimentally from the measurements of two embedded accelerometers. The sensors were spaced apart in the travel direction, and subsequently the speed was directly related to the time delay between the received signals. No assumption was made regarding the vehicle and pavement properties. Model accelerations were presented, studied, and contrasted against field measurements; the latter were shown to be dominated by random vibration sources. Two calculation techniques were offered and applied to handle the noisy data. The first was based on time-centroids, and the second was based on cross-correlation with kernel presmoothing. The overall concept is deemed promising not only for inferring speeds but also for extracting additional traffic characteristics such as axle spacing and relative axle load distributions.
A weighted sparse reconstruction-based ultrasonic guided wave anomaly imaging method for composite laminates
 Ultrasonic guided wave is a promising tool for structural health monitoring and nondestructive testing. Numerous signal processing methods have been proposed to detect and localize anomalies based on ultrasonic guided waves for plate-like structures. However, imaging performance is limited in these methods, such as large spot size and significant artifacts. To achieve a better imaging performance of Lamb waves, a weighted sparse reconstruction-based anomaly imaging method is proposed for plate-like structures. Scattering signals are sparsely decomposed in a dictionary pre-constructed from Lamb wave propagation and scattering models. The pixel value at each location of the imaging region can be obtained by solving a weighted sparse reconstruction problem. To verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments on a carbon fiber reinforced plastic with and without additional mass are conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve anomaly imaging with smaller spot size and fewer artifacts.
Thermal Sensors
 The thermal infrared spectrum of the Earth as observed from space contains a wealth of information regarding the chemical composition and temperature of the atmosphere and surface. The wavelength range referred to by the term “thermal infrared” spans more than two orders of magnitude, and specialized materials and techniques are required to develop sensors that operate effectively in this spectral region. This article provides an introduction to the components used in thermal sensors, an overview of basic sensor design and operation concepts, and a discussion of instrument calibration.
Monitoring early-age setting of silica fume concrete using wave propagation techniques
 It is imperative to investigate and monitor young and plastic concrete as soon as it is poured into the moulds from both, technical as well as economic considerations. It would facilitate to detect any anomalies in concrete and to undertake any remedial action at an early stage and avoid the hardship of dismantling solidified concrete later. The focus of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of wave propagation based Non-Destructive Techniques (NDT) of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGW) and Acoustic Emission (AE) to determine their efficacy in analysing the setting behaviour of concrete made with 6–12% replacement of cement by Silica Fume (SF). Test results indicate that a judicious combination of the three NDT techniques utilizing wave propagation characteristics of UPV, discrete UGW and continuous AE monitoring give a good indication of the setting mechanism of normal concrete as well as SF modified concrete. The three techniques applied in-situ in the field gives an early indication of the quality and efficiency of normal as well as SF modified concretes by studying the changes in UPV, transmitted UGW signal strength and AE hits with the setting of concrete. The research effort proposes an in-situ set-up for early age monitoring of green concrete as soon as it is poured into moulds utilizing these wave propagation techniques.
Assessment, sources and predictability of the swell wave power arriving to Chile
 Located at the western border of South America, Chile lacks appreciable reservoirs of fossil fuels, and has begun an effort for developing renewable energies. As the wave power increases to the south, and the southern border of the Chilean Interconnected electrical network lies by 40°S, the zone around Chiloé Island represents a unique opportunity for harvesting wave energy. Using results from a 20-year global numerical wave model we assessed the wave power and its variability for the Chilean coast, and we determined the sources of the swell arriving to the coast. Wave power and wave arriving direction increased rather steadily from 25 kW/m and SW at the northern Chile (∼18°S) to 100 kW/m and W near the south (∼54°S). A validated high resolution wave model was developed for the ocean around Chiloé Island. Determination of wave generation zones allows foreseeing a potentially accurate forecast of wave energy for this area. Total wave power along 10% of the coastline of Chiloé Island is of around 1800 MW–720 MW during the year. We postulate that wave energy harvesting could fulfill the electricity needs at the remote regions of Southern Chile.
Wave propagation based monitoring of concrete curing using piezoelectric materials: Review and path forward
 The in-situ strength of concrete is often evaluated by destructive compressive strength tests conducted on cylinders or cube specimens cast alongside the main structure. Various non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are also available in the industry. In the past decade, the use of piezoelectric based wave propagation (WP) techniques for monitoring the curing process of concrete has attracted considerable interest from researchers in the civil engineering discipline and hence there is a need to summarize the state of knowledge in order for future research efforts to be focused and relevant. This paper therefore presents a review of recent research and development of the abovementioned research area. Existing NDT techniques and piezoelectric based techniques for the monitoring of concrete curing are initially reviewed. Developments associated with the WP technique employing both embedded and surface bonded piezoelectric transducers are then presented. Finally, successful applications of the WP technique are provided. A wide range of parameters adopted by different researchers as concrete strength indicators are also summarized. Theoretical and numerical models available are reviewed, followed by a summary of practical issues related to the application of this technique. Several studies to date have proven the capability of the WP technique in monitoring the curing process of concrete. More rigorous studies are, however, required before a mature technique is developed that can entice commercial interest. Thus, future areas of investigation are identified in the final section. This article is expected to serve as an introduction for researchers interested in venturing into this area and as a valuable summary to inspire existing researchers for further improving the technique.
Derivation of vertical wavelengths of gravity waves in the MLT-region from multispectral airglow observations
 We present the derivation of gravity wave vertical wavelengths from OH airglow observations of different vibrational transitions. It utilizes small phase shifts regularly observed between the OH(3-1) and OH(4-2) intensities in the spectra of the GRIPS (GRound-based Infrared P-branch Spectrometer) instruments, which record the OH airglow emissions in the wavelength range from 1.5  μm to 1.6  μm simultaneously. These phase shifts are interpreted as being due to gravity waves passing through the OH airglow layer and affecting individual vibrational transitions at slightly different times due to small differences in their emission heights. The results are compared with co-located observations of the Na-Lidar measurements acquired between 2010 and 2014 at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR, 69.28° N, 16.01° E), Norway. This comparison shows best agreement if the mean height difference of the OH(3-1) and OH(4-2) emission is assumed to be 540 m (1σ = 160 m). The results are also compared with co-located observations of the OH(6-2)- and O2b(0-1)-transitions by means of spectrometer observations (TANGOO instrument, Tilting-filter spectrometer for Atmospheric Nocturnal Ground-based Oxygen & hydrOxyl emission measurements) performed from 2013 until 2016 at Oberpfaffenhofen (48.08° N, 11.27° E), Germany. For approximately 40% of all wave events observed with GRIPS in the period range from 0.25 h to 17 h, a quantitative estimate of the phase relationship between the OH(3-1) and OH(4-2) intensities can be retrieved from the spectra allowing derivation of vertical wavelengths. The retrieval performs best for wave periods below two hours (80% success rate) and worse for periods above ten hours (successful in less than 10% of the cases). The average wavelength determined from 102 events amounts to 22.9 km (1σ: 9.0 km). The corresponding mean wavelength determined from the TANGOO observations amounts to 22.6 km ± 10.5 km, if a mean separation of 6.5 km is assumed for the height difference between the OH(6-2) and O2b(0-1)-transitions.
Characteristics of ring type traveling wave ultrasonic motor in vacuum
 The characteristics of ultrasonic motor strongly depend on the properties of stator/rotor contact interface which are affected by ambient environment. With the developed apparatus, load properties of two ring type traveling wave ultrasonic motors in atmosphere, low vacuum and high vacuum were studied, respectively. Wear of friction material, variations of vacuum degree and the temperature of motor during the experiment were also measured. The results show that load properties of motor A in vacuum were poorer than those in atmosphere, when load torque Mf was less than 0.55 N m. Compared to motor A, load properties of motor B were affected a little by environmental pressure. Wear of friction material in vacuum was more severe than wear in atmosphere. The temperature of motor in vacuum rose more quickly than it in atmosphere and had not reached equilibrium in 2 h experiment. However, the temperature of motor in atmosphere had reached equilibrium in about forth minutes. Furthermore, outgas was also observed during experiment under vacuum conditions.
Ultra-fast tuning of refractive index in Lithium Niobate slab by GHz acoustic wave
 Refractive index modulation in optical materials facilitates dynamic control on electromagnetic waves. Ultra fast tuning of both refractive index and its spatial distribution in Y−Z Lithium Niobate slab via strain employed through GHz acoustic perturbation has been simulated and studied. To create acoustic disturbance in taken 500 nm thick slab, the fundamental symmetric Lamb mode at 5 GHz acoustic frequency is excited. Displacement field patterns generated by longitudinal and transverse disturbances of perturbing fundamental symmetric Lamb mode are analyzed under reinstate limits of optical material to create elastic strain. Modification in optical index of Lithium Niobate due to strain generated by longitudinal and transverse acoustic disturbance is then examined. The sinusoidal modulation in refractive index with maximum change of 0.070 along nz and 0.036 along ny is observed. The modulated refractive index has a periodic distribution over space with period equals to wavelength of acoustic disturbance created by fundamental Lamb mode. This acoustically induced ultra-fast change in refractive index and in its spatial distribution depends on perturbing acoustic frequency and thickness of slab. Thus, the slab can optimize dynamically, to control electromagnetic wave for various optical applications.
Locating fatigue damage using temporal signal features of nonlinear Lamb waves
 The temporal signal features of linear guided waves, as typified by the time-of-flight (ToF), have been exploited intensively for identifying damage, with proven effectiveness in locating gross damage in particular. Upon re-visiting the conventional, ToF-based detection philosophy, the present study extends the use of temporal signal processing to the realm of nonlinear Lamb waves, so as to reap the high sensitivity of nonlinear Lamb waves to small-scale damage (e.g., fatigue cracks), and the efficacy of temporal signal processing in locating damage. Nonlinear wave features (i.e., higher-order harmonics) are extracted using networked, miniaturized piezoelectric wafers, and reverted to the time domain for damage localization. The proposed approach circumvents the deficiencies of using Lamb wave features for evaluating undersized damage, which are either undiscernible in time-series analysis or lacking in temporal information in spectral analysis. A probabilistic imaging algorithm is introduced to supplement the approach, facilitating the presentation of identification results in an intuitive manner. Through numerical simulation and then experimental validation, two damage indices (DIs) are comparatively constructed, based, respectively, on linear and nonlinear temporal features of Lamb waves, and used to locate fatigue damage near a rivet hole of an aluminum plate. Results corroborate the feasibility and effectiveness of using temporal signal features of nonlinear Lamb waves to locate small-scale fatigue damage, with enhanced accuracy compared with linear ToF-based detection. Taking a step further, a synthesized detection strategy is formulated by amalgamating the two DIs, targeting continuous and adaptive monitoring of damage from its onset to macroscopic formation.
Incremental scattering of the A0 Lamb wave mode from a notch emanating from a through-hole
 Lamb wave scattering from a crack originating at a through-hole is of practical importance because of the abundance of fastener holes used in engineering structures. Notches are often used to simulate cracks so that Lamb wave methods can be more conveniently investigated in the laboratory. A linear, three-dimensional finite element model is employed in this paper to study incremental scattering of the fundamental anti-symmetric (A0) Lamb wave mode from notches emanating from through-holes. The term “incremental scattering” refers to the change in scattering caused by introduction of the notch and is motivated by structural health monitoring for which transducers are fixed and signal changes are interpreted to detect damage. Far-field angular scattering patterns are generated for multiple incident angles and frequencies, and such patterns are experimentally validated at one frequency by laser vibrometry measurements. Comparisons are made between a vertical notch alone (no hole) and notches located above and below the through-hole. Additionally, holes of different sizes are considered to investigate the effect of hole diameter on incremental scattering patterns. Results show that the presence, location and size of the through-hole affect both the shape and strength of notch incremental scattering patterns.
On the probability of detecting wall thinning defects with dispersive circumferential guided waves
 Two ultrasonic techniques are well established for pipe inspection and monitoring: highly sensitive ultrasonic spot thickness measurements, which can be presented in C-scan form, or low frequency guided waves that rapidly screen large areas for big defects. Recently there has been a growing interest in pipe inspection and monitoring systems exploring the middle ground between these two techniques by using higher frequency guided waves over shorter distances. In this paper the use of an axial transducer array (more suitable for monitoring applications) or a single axially scanned transducer (more suitable for inspections) that sends and receives dispersive circumferential guided waves around a pipe has been studied. The presence of a defect is detected as a result of a change in the wave travel time around the pipe circumference as a result of the thickness reduction. Both measurement modalities have a pitch between adjacent transducers/measurements. By approximating the pipe to a plate, a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capabilities (probability of detection-POD) of this short range guided wave technique as a function of scan or transducer pitch is presented. The performance of three guided wave modes (A0, S0, and SH1) are compared in a 10 mm thick plate. The results help to optimize the pitch and defect sensitivity of the setup. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that the S0 mode, at 2 MHz.mm, is the most suitable for detecting wide shallow defects. For the same detection capabilities a much wider pitch can be used for S0 mode transducers as compared to SH1 mode transducers. Whereas the SH1 mode, at 3 MHz.mm, is better suited to detecting narrow and deep defects using a relatively small pitch. The S0 mode is much less sensitive to these defects. The A0 mode was excluded from the POD analysis because it had a much higher variability in average thickness measurements, at comparable SNRs, compared to the other two modes.
The pressure field beneath intense surface water wave groups
 A weakly-nonlinear potential theory is developed for the description of deep penetrating pressure fields caused by single and colliding wave groups of collinear waves due to the second-order nonlinear interactions. The result is applied to the representative case of groups with the sech-shape of envelope solitons in deep water. When solitary groups experience a head-on collision, the induced due to nonlinearity dynamic pressure may have magnitude comparable with the magnitude of the linear solution. It attenuates with depth with characteristic length of the group, which may greatly exceed the individual wave length. In general the picture of the dynamic pressure beneath intense wave groups looks complicated. The qualitative difference in the structure of the induced pressure field for unidirectional and opposite wave trains is emphasized.
Identification of breathing type disbonds in stiffened panels using non-linear lamb waves and built-in circular PWT array
 A non-linear Lamb wave based active sensing technique for identification of breathing type disbonds in stiffened metallic plates has been presented. In this technique, a built-in dual transmitter and multi receivers (DTMR) clock-like array of piezoelectric wafer transducers (PWT) is used. The central part of the array consists of two transmitters, which are placed concentrically on either side of the plate. A Hanning window modulated sine pulse has been used for excitation. Opposite polling is applied to the transmitters to generate a predominant anti-symmetric (A0) Lamb mode to encourage breathing in the disbond. It is observed that the contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN) of breathing disbond generates higher harmonics when a primary Lamb wave interacts with the disbond. Since these harmonics carry damage information, a bandpass filter is used to extract the second harmonic component from the received signals followed by wavelet transformation. Finally, the transformed signals are used to device a baseline free damage detection algorithm for locating the disbond. Experimental investigations are carried out to interrogate a full width disbond that is located either at the middle of the T-stiffener or at an offset from its center. The damage index (DI) map obtained for the entire plate show higher values at the disbond location. Once the disbond is localized, a damage quantity (DQ) curve is devised to determine the extent of disbond with a high degree of accuracy. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out using commercially available finite element package, ANSYS 14.0, in an effort to examine the effectiveness of the damage detection algorithm and to further establish the DQ curves. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental findings that affirm the robustness of the nonlinear active sensing technique for detection and assessment of breathing type disbond in stiffened aluminium panels without requiring the baseline signals.
Functional thin films and nanostructures for sensors
 In this modern age, sensors are used in all aspects of life, whether to gather data in a laboratory, to control system in industrial process, to measure sugar or cholesterol levels in blood, car, and home alarm systems, or as huge as home-land security, sensors have become an essential in our private and general surroundings. An important part of the sensor system is the transducer, where a lot of innovations and improvement takes place in order to improve sensor output both quantitatively and qualitatively. Nanofilms and nanostructured materials can contribute largely to the processes of sensing, such as stability improvement, signal noise filtering, and most important in the transduction element. Functional nanofilms and micro- and nanostructured materials can achieve more functions in many applications that range far beyond sensing. In this chapter, sensors, transducers, and their applications are discussed. Preparations and characterization of the functional nanofilms and micro- and nanostructured materials are introduced in the framework of transduction. The significant roles of functional nanofilms in resolving matters and their advantages in applications both in liquid and gas phase sensors are demonstrated. This main part of the chapter covers the description of sensors, sensors types, transducers, transducing principles, preparations, and characterization methods of nanostructured materials, as well as applications of functional thin films and nanostructured materials in sensing.
On attenuation and measurement of Lamb waves in viscoelastic composites
 In this work, the influence of viscoelastic material properties, as featured by fibre reinforced plastics, on the measurement of Lamb waves with the aid of surface-applied piezoelectric sensors is examined. The focus points are frequency dependent material dampening and dispersion on the one hand and the impact of sensor size, wave excitation and measurement method on the other hand. The dependence of the measured wave propagation characteristics and the deviation from the actual characteristics is investigated to assess the relevance for Lamb wave based nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring methods. The sensor responses of piezoelectric sensors bonded to the surface of a viscoelastic composite are predicted by a comprehensive model including these influencing factors. The modelling approach is compared with experimentally measured values to evaluate both the methods and the relevance of the influencing factors.
Experimental observation of increased apparent dispersion and mixing in a beach aquifer due to wave forcing
 Solute dispersion and mixing in beach aquifers is strongly influenced by highly transient flow induced from wave forcing. While transport at the groundwater-ocean interface has been modelled, little is known about the quantitative effect of wave forcing on solute dispersion and mixing in beach aquifers. We use a prototype-scale laboratory flume experiment to conduct tracer transport experiments at two locations within a wave-forced beach aquifer. For the first time we demonstrate by systematic laboratory experimentation that transient conditions in the re-circulation zone due to run-up and beach face infiltration as well as head oscillations caused by wave forcing strongly disperse and mix subsurface solute plumes. Wave forcing can increase the apparent dispersion by an order of magnitude depending on conditions, compared to solute transport without waves. Our findings illustrate that beach aquifer transport models need to consider the additional dispersion to correctly quantify mixing and biogeochemical processes in this highly dynamic zone.
Multifunctional and miniaturized flexible sensor patch: Design and application for in situ monitoring of epoxy polymerization
 Sensor systems capable of in situ, continuous impedance measurements are expected to play an important role for a broad spectrum of applications. However, widespread use of these devices is hindered by their current form of separated sensors from bulky, expensive readout instruments. Moreover, the lack of other relevant sensing functionalities on the same system results in an incomplete understanding of the complex physical and chemical changes taking place. In this paper, a miniaturized sensor patch (MSP) with simultaneous impedance and temperature measurements and fully integrated readout is cleverly designed. By using an on-board microcontroller, sensor signal is read out locally and transmitted digitally, eliminating the noise on the signal over the transmission path. The MSP is stable over a wide temperature range (20–180 °C), and in various dielectric mediums (air, epoxies). Moreover, flexible circuit board technology based device fabrication permits further extended functionalities of the patch with off-the-shelf surface mounted devices. The MSPs were successfully applied for monitoring the polymerization processes of two epoxies, demonstrated the potential of the proposed sensor patch as an integrated and multifunctional sensing solution.
Rapid localization of damage using a circular sensor array and Lamb wave based triangulation
 A damage detection and imaging methodology based on symmetry of neighborhood sensor path and similarity of signal patterns with respect to radial paths in a circular array of sensors has been developed. It uses information regarding Lamb wave propagation along with a triangulation scheme to rapidly locate and quantify the severity of damage without using all of the sensor data. In a plate like structure, such a scheme can be effectively employed besides full field imaging of wave scattering pattern from the damage, if present in the plate. This new scheme is validated experimentally. Hole and corrosion type damages have been detected and quantified using the proposed scheme successfully. A wavelet based cumulative damage index has been studied which shows monotonic sensitivity against the severity of the damage, which is most desired in a Structural Health Monitoring system.

 This chapter introduces basic concepts related sensors and actuators.
Gas Sensors
 This chapter covers selected topics on sensors and analyzers from the point of view of its fundamentals, their development, and their applications in buildings, transportation, medicine, homeland security, and industry, with which the author was involved during his 42 years with the Honeywell Labs. Space limitations clearly demanded a focus on just a few of such developments, of which microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based sensors received a major share, and within that large field, thermal microbridge (MB) sensors are discussed in some detail, covering sensors for flow, thermal conductivity, specific heat, pressure (Pirani gage), infrared radiation, temperature, and special sensing effects (electrochemical (EC) and impedance changes) with thin films of metal oxides and polymers. Also discussed is how such simple measurements of specific heat and thermal conductivity can be used for correlations with more complex gas properties such as heating value, octane number, and compressibility, as well as how oscillatory responses of such sensors can lead to useful normalization signals. The reader is then led from the basically single-channel sensors to multichannel sensors or analyzers, while highlighting how that same MB technology led to innovative micro gas chromatography (micro-GC) approaches. Then presented are the analytical benefits of scaling analyzers down to microanalyzers, as well as first separating an unknown gas mixture via GC into its components before exposing them to further analysis (for identification and quantitation) to optical-spectroscopic, mass analysis, ion mobility, or polymeric instruments. These multichannel GC detectors thus add a second dimension to the gas analysis, with the associated benefit of more reliable analyte identification. Such identification is further detailed in Section ‘Errors, Uncertainty, Self-Calibration, and False Positives’ in the context of sensor error, self-calibration, and the notion of false alarm probability, the rapid determination of which still requires significant R&D.
Ambient noise tomography of three-dimensional near-surface shear-wave velocity structure around the hydraulic fracturing site using surface microseismic monitoring array
 Surface microseismic monitoring array has been widely used to monitor hydraulic fracturing process for developing unconventional oil/gas reservoirs. Here we take advantage of relatively dense surface seismic stations for monitoring the fracturing process of a shale gas reservoir in southwest China, to determine the shallow Vs structure around the fracking site using the ambient noise tomography. This is because having a detailed three-dimensional (3D) Vs model is important for 3D seismic structure inversion. For ambient noise tomography, we use 21 days of continuous ambient noise data to extract Rayleigh wave group and phase dispersion data in the period band of 0.1–0.5 s. The 3D Vs structure is inverted by the direct surface wave tomographic method that directly inverts surface wave dispersion data for 3D Vs model. With the spatial coverage of 4 km by 4 km for this surface seismic array, we can determine the Vs structure down to 400 m. Our inversion results show that shear wave velocity in this region can be up to about 3 km/s above 400 m depth, which is consistent with the lithology of drilling core along the well. The obtained model is further validated by checkerboard test and the close relationship between waveform amplitude and the local velocity structure around stations. It is found that large waveform amplitudes are associated with stations located at shallow low velocity anomalies due to surface reverberations. This application shows that ambient noise tomography using local dense seismic array can be used to reliably determine high-resolution 3D shear velocity structure in the near surface.
Temperature evaluation of traveling-wave ultrasonic motor considering interaction between temperature rise and motor parameters
 In this paper, a novel model for evaluating the temperature of traveling-wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM) is developed. The proposed model, where the interaction between the temperature rise and motor parameters is considered, differs from the previous reported models with constant parameters. In this model, losses and temperature rises of the motor were evaluated based on the temperature-related varying parameters: the feedback voltage Vaux of the stator, dielectric permittivity ɛ and dielectric loss factor tan δ. At each new temperature, Vaux, ɛ and tan δ were updated. The feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed model was verified by comparing the predicted temperatures with the measured one. The effects of driving voltage, driving frequency and ambient temperature on the predicted temperature were also analyzed. The results show that the proposed model has more accurate predicted temperature than that with constant parameters. This will be very useful for the optimal design, reducing the heat loss, improvement of control and reliability life of TWUSM.
Study on the influence of semiconductive property for the improvement of nanogenerator by wave mode approach
 Some piezoelectric materials, such as zinc oxide, are semiconductors simultaneously. Usually, the semiconductive property of these materials is omitted in the study of piezoelectric characteristics. However, due to the small sizes of some piezoelectric devices, such as nanogenerators, the semiconductive property may have an appreciable impact on the wave motion characteristics and potential output. In this paper, we study the influence of semiconductive property for the improvement of nanogernerators through the propagation of shear-horizontal waves in a piezoelectric semiconductor plate of 6 mm class crystals by using wave mode approach. Some interesting results are observed from the points of both mechanical and electrical views. Mechanically, the semiconductive property will reduce the frequencies of waves (decrease the kinetic energy of waves), and cause new size-dependent wave modes due to the drift of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, a size-dependent acoustic loss is generated, where the acoustic loss becomes greater when the size gets smaller. Electrically, by comparing the magnitudes and distributions of potential between the cases with and without semiconduction, it is presented that energy can be harvested not only when the deformations are generated but also when the deformations are recovering. Further, the potential output in piezoelectric semiconductor can be improved by increasing strain and reducing conductivity. These results are useful for the design of piezoelectric semiconductor devices. They are also good corrections to the theoretical analyses of some piezoelectric devices in which semiconductive property is omitted, especially for the devices with small sizes.
An improved time reversal method for diagnostics of composite plates using Lamb waves
 The time reversal method has been widely used to detect damage in composite plates. Based on the time reversibility of Lamb waves, the waveform of the original input signal will be reconstructed after the time reversal process. However, the time reversal operator of Lamb waves in composite plates is a function of frequency. Thus the shape of the reconstructed signal will not be identical to that of the original input signal. To alleviate the effects of the time reversal operator, an improved time reversal method (ITRM) is proposed. In this method, the response signal in the forward path and the reconstructed signal in the time reversed path are both modulated by a weight vector which is obtained as the product of a window function and the reciprocal of amplitude dispersion. The window function varies with the excitation signal adaptively, and its shape is also determined by a threshold. An experimental example is then introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of the ITRM. The results show that the time reversibility can be greatly enhanced and the impact damage in the composite plate can be exactly located by the ITRM.
A model assessment method for predicting structural fatigue life using Lamb waves
 This paper presents a study on model assessment for predicting structural fatigue life using Lamb waves. Lamb wave coupon testing is performed for model development. Three damage sensitive features, namely normalized energy, phase change, and correlation coefficient are extracted from Lamb wave data and are used to quantify the crack size. Four data-driven models are proposed. The average relative error and the probability of detection (POD) are proposed as two measures to evaluate the performance of the four models. To study the influence of model choice on the probabilistic fatigue life prediction, probability density functions of the actual crack size are obtained from the POD models given the Lamb wave data. Crack growth model parameters are statistically identified using Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model assessment and the influence of model choice on fatigue life prediction are made using both coupon testing data with artificial cracks and realistic lap joint testing data with naturally developed cracks.
Impulse waves in reservoirs generated by landslides into shallow water
 Landslides sliding into shallow water often block watercourses, and in addition landslide-induced impulse waves may result in risks to the safety of the reservoir or waterways over a wide area. Such impulse waves differ from those from landslides into deep water which slide underwater completely. This study conducted twenty-five groups of orthogonal experiments of landslide-induced impulse waves in shallow water where the Froude numbers ranged between 0.6 and 2.0. Based on the experimental results, dimensionless functions of the parameters such as amplitude, wavelength and jet-flow height of the initial landslide-induced waves in shallow water were derived. The predictions from these formulae are very close to those obtained from the experiments. Further, a source model of landslide-induced waves in shallow water was built based on formulae derived from the experiments, and wave propagation and run-up were calculated with the Boussinesq-type equations model. The newly built model of landslide-induced waves in shallow water was used to calculate and analyze two representative examples from landslides in the Three Gorges in China, namely the Qianjiangping landslide-induced impulse wave event and the Xintan landslide-induced impulse wave event. Comparison of the calculations with data from multiple sources indicated that our model for landslide-induced waves in shallow water had high accuracy. Our model for landslide-induced waves in shallow water may help in the predictive analysis of impulse waves and mitigation works for this type of event in reservoirs worldwide.
Nitric oxide optical fiber sensor based on exposed core fibers and CdTe/CdS quantum dots
 Nitric oxide plays a crucial role as a messenger in biological systems, but limitations in measurement are restricted due to its relatively low concentration and short half-life time. Here we report a novel approach to sensing nitric oxide by using an exposed core fiber with its core coated with CdTe/CdS core/shell quantum dots. This enables rapid detection and opens up the possibility of monitoring its production within biological systems. The detection mechanism is based on fluorescence quenching of CdTe/CdS quantum dots by nitric oxide, which can coordinate with Cd2+ directly as a ligand forming transition metal complexes. We demonstrate that CdTe/CdS quantum dots functionlization exposed core optical fibers can respond rapidly to nitric oxide in physiological environments with picomolar sensitivity.
Currents, waves and sediment transport around the headland of Pt. Dume, California
 Sediment transport past rocky headlands has received less attention compared to transport along beaches. Here we explore, in a field-based study, possible pathways for sediment movement adjacent to Point Dume, a headland in Santa Monica Bay, California. This prominent shoreline feature is a nearly symmetrical, triangular-shaped promontory interior to the Santa Monica Littoral Cell. We collected current, wave, and turbidity data for 74 days during which several wave events occurred, including one associated with a remote hurricane and another generated by the first winter storm of 2014. We also acquired sediment samples to quantify seabed grain-size distributions. Near-bottom currents towards the headland dominated on both of its sides and wave-driven longshore currents in the surf zone were faster on the exposed side. Bed shear stresses were generated mostly by waves with minor contributions from currents, but both wave-driven and other currents contributed to sediment flux. On the wave-exposed west side of the headland, suspended sediment concentrations correlated with bed stress suggesting local resuspension whereas turbidity levels on the sheltered east side of the headland are more easily explained by advective delivery. Most of the suspended sediment appears to be exported offshore due to flow separation at the apex of the headland but may not move far given that sediment fluxes at moorings offshore of the apex were small. Further, wave-driven sediment flux in the surf zone is unlikely to pass the headland due to the discontinuity in wave forcing that causes longshore transport in different directions on each side of the headland. It is thus unlikely that sand is transported past the headland (specifically in a westerly direction), although some transport of finer fractions may occur offshore in deep water. These findings of minimal sediment flux past Point Dume are consistent with its role as a littoral cell boundary, although more complex multi-stage processes and unusual events may account for some transport at times.
Numerical prediction and experimental verification of temperature effect on plate waves generated and received by piezoceramic sensors
 This work proposes a numerical approach based on a Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) model to predict temperature effects on guided waves generated and received by low-profile piezoceramic (PZT) transducers. The proposed model includes the cumulative role of transducer elements (actuator and sensor), substrate structure, and transducer/structure interaction, in the prediction of the full pitch-catch guided wave response under changing temperature. Experimental tests were carried out in a controlled environmental chamber at different temperatures ranging from −40 °C up to 60 °C. Time and frequency domain based system responses were obtained. Numerical versus experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the effect of temperature on PZTs generated/received Lamb waves with great accuracy. In addition, because the SAFE is capable to model also wave propagation in anisotropic plates, the proposed model can lay the groundwork for the development of more robust Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies for complex aerospace structures.
Momentum transfer under laboratory wind waves
 In this study, we explain contradictory previous observations of the contribution of coherent wave organised motion to the downward transfer of momentum through wave Reynolds stresses (ρu˜w˜¯) below wind waves. The generation of non-zero u˜w˜¯ is potentially significant because 1) the turbulent mixing is not then the only momentum transport mechanism under wind waves as was previously assumed, 2) this provides a wave-current energy exchange pathway that could explain inconsistencies in measured air- and water-side wind-wave energy transfer and 3) it can be a critical term in the wave-current coupling formulation under wind waves. However, such a mechanism for momentum transfer has generally been ignored, since contradictory observations were reported. Here, two new sets of wind-wave laboratory experiments are reported. For the first set, contradictory u˜w˜¯ were observed, as in previous literature. Investigating the sources of such inconsistency, we examined spatial inhomogeneity due to wave reflection through a second set of experiments, by varying instrument location and additionally considering random waves. The results resolve the inconsistencies observed in the first set of experiments and previous measurements. In addition, we emphasise the contribution of secondary circulation cells in momentum transfer under wind waves.
Monitoring the hydration of cement using highly nonlinear solitary waves
 In this paper we present a nondestructive evaluation technique based on the propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves (HNSWs) to monitor the hydration of cement. HNSWs are mechanical waves that can form and travel in highly nonlinear systems, such as one-dimensional chains of contacting spherical particles (i.e., granular crystals). In the present study, we use a granular crystal-based actuator/sensor to observe the solitary waves propagating to and from the mechanical interface between the transducer and a fresh gypsum cement sample. We hypothesize that the reflected HNSWs traveling along the crystal-based transducer are affected by the hydration process of the cement, and we assess the elastic modulus of the specimen in the localized region of the granular crystal contact. To verify the experimental results, we perform numerical simulations based on a simplified finite element model. The elastic properties of the cement specimen measured by the granular crystal transducer are compared with the compressive strength and the elastic modulus measurements obtained from destructive tests, conducted according to the ASTM C109. We observe good agreement between experiments and numerical simulations.
A flexible multifunctional tactile sensor using interlocked zinc oxide nanorod arrays for artificial electronic skin
 In the development of artificial electronic skin (e-skin), a flexible tactile sensor is a critical component that imitates human skin response to dynamic and static stimuli. In this study, we developed a novel multifunctional tactile sensor to mimic human skin with high force sensitivity, high flexibility, and temperature measurable performance. The unique geometry of the interlocked structures enabled differentiation between different mechanical stimuli, including pressure, bending and torsion forces. The substrate was flexible because of the material properties of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer. The top electrode and bottom electrode layers were interlocked by high-aspect-ratio zinc oxide nanorods (NRs), which were grown vertically on the PDMS surface, providing high sensitivity for the measurement of contact force and environmental temperature. Moreover, the sensor was applied for measuring and monitoring arterial pulse pressure. Thus, we successfully fabricated a 3 × 3 sensor array with multiple functions, which were verified through experiments. In the future, the proposed tactile sensor can be used in wearable health care devices, flexible interfaces, and bionic robotic skins in the industry.
Crust and upper mantle shear wave structure of Northeast Algeria from Rayleigh wave dispersion analysis
 We resolve the crust and upper mantle structure beneath Northeast Algeria at depths of 0–400 km, using inversion of fundamental mode Rayleigh wave. Our data set consists of 490 earthquakes recorded between 2007 and 2014 by five permanent broadband seismic stations in the study area. Applying a combination of different filtering technics and inversion method shear wave velocities structure were determined as functions of depth. The resolved changes in Vs at 50 km depth are in perfect agreement with crustal thickness estimates, which reflect the study area’s orogenic setting, partly overlying the collision zone between the African and Eurasian plates. The inferred Moho discontinuity depths are close to those estimated for other convergent areas. In addition, there is good agreement between our results and variations in orientations of regional seismic anisotropy. At depths of 80–180 km, negative Vs anomalies at station CBBR suggest the existence of a failed subduction slab.
Changes in the Scheduling Process According to Observed Activity-travel Flexibility
 In this work we analyze the reasons for changing pre-planned activities and travels episodes considering the type of modification observed during the scheduling process. Specifically we selected a small sample from those pre-planned episodes that are no executed at all as a pilot study. The data analyzed was collected in the first wave of a weekly activity-travel panel survey carried out in Valencia (Spain) in 2010. Each survey wave consisted on a face-to-face interview to generate a pre-planned activity agenda for the following week, an activity-travel diary implemented on mobile phones to collect activities and travels as they are executed, and in-depth telephone interviews to inquire about differences between pre-planned agenda and observed activities and travels. This methodology allowed to collect data related to how respondents pre-planned activity-travel episodes and how they re-scheduled them before execution. Observed modification types provide us with information about their spatio-temporal and social flexibility. Open-ended records collected in the in-depth telephone interviews, were coded and provided a semi-formal segmentation and categorization of the changing process as the basis of our study. Spatio-temporal and social constraints, biological needs and resource constraints are differentiated along with facets of the activity-travel episodes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents.
Integrated non-destructive assessment of concrete structures under flexure by acoustic emission and travel time tomography
 Elastic stress wave methods are attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners for real time monitoring of structures as well as quantitative evaluation of damage. The acoustic emission (AE) and travel time tomography (TTT) techniques are promising elastic waves-based diagnosis approaches for condition assessment of structures. In this research, fiber reinforced concrete beams loaded under flexure were monitored using both the AE and TTT techniques. The primary aim was to evaluate the development of fracture in beams in a non-destructive manner, with the two adopted techniques complementing each other to provide a more reliable assessment. There was satisfactory agreement between the results of AE parametric analysis and tomographic reconstruction, suggesting the feasibility of integrating the two techniques for a more comprehensive and effective condition assessment of structures.
Detection of crack propagation in concrete with embedded ultrasonic sensors
 This study evaluates the sensitivity of embedded ultrasonic sensors to detect propagating cracks within concrete. Because of the sensors constant coupling to the medium, highly sensitive data analysis techniques, such as the correlation between signals and their attenuation, are applied to detect changes in the signal due to propagating cracks. The accuracy of the detected onset of the crack is evaluated with the nondestructive testing methods acoustic emission and Digital Image Correlation. It shows that with embedded ultrasonic sensors crack propagation can be detected before it is visible on the surface of the concrete.
A tunnel magnetoresistive effect wattmeters-based wireless sensors network
 In the present work a wireless sensors network (WSN) for smart energy metering is presented using the ZigBee protocol as the communication link. Each network node process the electrical power by means of a Wheatstone bridge sensor based on the tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) effect working as analogue multiplier. The electrical power is acquired and processed by a digital signal processor that extracts various parameters of interest like current and voltage load, active power and power factor by means of Fourier analysis. All the obtained electrical parameters at each node are served and shown in a web page that can be easily accessed by authorized users.
Acoustic emission source localization in thin metallic plates: A single-sensor approach based on multimodal edge reflections
 This paper presents a new acoustic emission (AE) source localization for isotropic plates with reflecting boundaries. This approach that has no blind spot leverages multimodal edge reflections to identify AE sources with only a single sensor. The implementation of the proposed approach involves three main steps. First, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the dispersion curves of the fundamental Lamb wave modes are utilized to estimate the distance between an AE source and a sensor. This step uses a modal acoustic emission approach. Then, an analytical model is proposed that uses the estimated distances to simulate the edge-reflected waves. Finally, the correlation between the experimental and the simulated waveforms is used to estimate the location of AE sources. Hsu-Nielsen pencil lead break (PLB) tests were performed on an aluminum plate to validate this algorithm and promising results were achieved. Based on these results, the paper reports the statistics of the localization errors.
Near-optimal control of a wave energy device in irregular waves with deterministic-model driven incident wave prediction
 This paper investigates wave-by-wave control of a wave energy converter using incident wave prediction based on up-wave surface elevation measurement. The goal of control is to approach the hydrodynamically optimum velocity leading to optimum power absorption. This work aims to study the gains in energy conversion from a deterministic wave propagation model that accounts for a range of group velocities in deriving the prediction. The up-wave measurement distance is assumed to be small enough to allow a deterministic propagation model, and further, both wave propagation and device response are assumed to be linear. For deep water conditions and long-crested waves, the propagation process is also described using an impulse response function (e.g. [1]). Approximate low and high frequency limits for realistic band-limited spectra are used to compute the corresponding group velocity limits. The prediction time into the future is based on the device impulse response function needed for the evaluation of the control force. The up-wave distance and the duration of measurement are then determined using the group velocity limits above. A 2-body axisymmetric heaving device is considered, for which power capture is through the relative heave oscillation between the two co-axial bodies. The power take-off is assumed to be linear and ideal as well as capable of applying the necessary resistive and reactive load components on the relative heave oscillation. The predicted wave profile is used along with device impulse response functions to compute the actuator force components at each instant. Calculations are carried out in irregular waves generated using a number of uni-modal wave spectra over a range of energy periods and significant wave heights. Results are compared with previous studies based on the use of instantaneous up-wave wave-profile measurements, both without and with oscillation constraints imposed. Considerable improvements in power capture are observed with the present approach over the range of wave conditions studied.
Measured vs. predicted site response at the Garner Valley Downhole Array considering shear wave velocity uncertainty from borehole and surface wave methods
 This paper compares measured and predicted site response at the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) using a wide range of shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles developed from both borehole methods and inversion of surface wave data. Only low amplitude ground motions, resulting in approximately linear-viscoelastic site response between the downhole accelerometer and the surface accelerometers, were considered in this study. Thus, uncertainties associated with the small-strain Vs profiles used for site response predictions play a considerable role in attempting to match the recorded site response and its associated variability. Prior to our study, two borehole Vs profiles extending into rock were available for the site. However, their predicted/theoretical transfer functions (TTFs) were quite different and in poor agreement with the measured/empirical transfer functions (ETFs). These differences provided motivation to collect and interpret an extensive set of active-source and passive-wavefield surface wave measurements in an attempt to develop deep Vs profiles for the site that might be used to more accurately model the measured site response and its associated variability. Suites of non-unique Vs profiles developed from inversion of the surface wave data visually exhibited considerable differences, yet their predicted TTFs matched the measured ETFs very well. These results provide further evidence that surface wave dispersion data and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio curves represent an experimental “site signature” that can be used as a quantitative means of assessing whether candidate Vs profiles are appropriate for use in site response analyses.
Blast wave dynamics: The influence of the shape of the explosive
 A numerical model is developed to analyse the influence of the shape of a high-explosive on the dynamics of the generated pressure wave. A Multi-Material Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MM-ALE) technique is used as the CONWEP approach is not adequate to model such situations. Validation and verification of the proposed numerical model is achieved based on experimental data obtained from the bibliography. The numerical model provides relevant information that cannot be obtained from the experimental results. The influence of the mass and shape of the high-explosive is studied and correlated to the dynamics of the generated blast wave through the analysis of peak pressures, time of arrival and impulse. Tests are done with constant mass hemispherical, cylindrical and flat-shaped Formex F4HV samples. A detailed analysis of the generated blast wave is done, along with a thorough comparison between incident and reflected waves. It is concluded that the dynamic effects of the reflected pressure pulses should always be considered in structural design, most relevantly when analysing closed structures where the number of reflections can be significant. The model is proved reliable, concluding that the frontal area of the high-explosive is a determinant driving parameter for the impulse generated by the blast.
Real time size-dependent particle segregation and quantitative detection in a surface acoustic wave-photoacoustic integrated microfluidic system
 We present an integrated microfluidic system capable of size-dependent separation, concentration, and quantitative detection of microparticles on a single piezoelectric (128° YX LiNbO3) substrate using surface acoustic wave (SAW) and photoacoustic (PA) technique. First, using a tilted-angle standing SAW highly efficient segregation of polystyrene beads of two different sizes was achieved in a continuous particle flow inside the channel. Flow-assisted migration of separated particles would then undergo particle aggregation using a SAW device, to preconcentrate the sample before detection The optical absorption of the pulsed laser by the polystyrene microparticles generates the PA wave. The detection scheme involves sensing the SAW generated by the optically induced mechanical resonance of the PA-wave inside the microfluidic channel. The SAW-PA signal was further correlated to the particle count. The developed integrated microfluidic system performs effectively, with separation efficiency above 95% for the 3- and 10-μm diameter polystyrene beads. The separated 10-μm particles were directed into the sensing chamber, where a SAW device concentrate the particles before real-time quantitative detection. The configuration and theoretical aspects of each integrated segments were studied and explained. The sensor presented a reliable (R2 = 0.98) detection of the 10-μm particles down to 7 particles in 10 μL of the sample volume in 15 min. This technique paves the way to the design and development of future lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices for clinical analyte detection and quantification.
One sensor acoustic emission localization in plates
 Acoustic emissions are elastic waves accompanying damage processes and are therefore used for monitoring the health state of structures. Most of the traditional acoustic emission techniques use a trilateration approach requiring at least three sensors on a 2D domain in order to localize sources of acoustic emission events. In this paper, we present a new approach which requires only a single sensor to identify and localize the source of acoustic emissions in a finite plate. The method proposed makes use of the time reversal principle and the dispersive nature of the flexural wave mode in a suitable frequency band. The signal shape of the transverse velocity response contains information about the propagated paths of the incoming elastic waves. This information is made accessible by a numerical time reversal simulation. The effect of dispersion is reversed and the original shape of the flexural wave is restored at the origin of the acoustic emission. The time reversal process is analyzed first for an infinite Mindlin plate, then by a 3D FEM simulation which in combination results in a novel acoustic emission localization process. The process is experimentally verified for different aluminum plates for artificially generated acoustic emissions (Hsu–Nielsen source). Good and reliable localization was achieved for a homogeneous quadratic aluminum plate with only one measurement.
Nondestructive inspection of spent nuclear fuel storage canisters using shear horizontal guided waves
 Nondestructive inspection (NDI) is an integral part of structural integrity analyses of dry storage casks that house spent nuclear fuel. One significant concern for the structural integrity is stress corrosion cracking in the heat-affected zone of welds in the stainless steel canister that confines the spent fuel. In situ NDI methodology for detection of stress corrosion cracking is investigated, where the inspection uses a delivery robot because of the presence of the harsh environment and geometric constrains inside the cask protecting the canister. Shear horizontal (SH) guided waves that are sensitive to cracks oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the wave vector are used to locate welds and to detect cracks. SH waves are excited and received by electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) using noncontact ultrasonic transduction and pulse-echo mode. A laboratory-scale canister mock-up is fabricated and inspected using the proposed methodology to evaluate the ability of EMATs to excite and receive SH waves and to locate welds. The EMAT's capability to detect notches from various distances is evaluated on a plate containing 25%-through-thickness surface-breaking notches. Based on the results of the distances at which notch reflections are detectable, NDI coverage for spent nuclear fuel storage canisters is determined.
Microwave Position Sensor for Hydraulic Drives
 The basics, design, prototype and characterization of a microwave based linear displacement sensor for piston position detection in hydraulic cylinders is presented. This function is important for industrial applications to provide a precise feedback in position controlled hydraulic drives. At present technologies for piston position detection have disadvantages and are cost-intensive. Used technologies are inductive, magnetostrictive, magnetic or mechanical and have the need for design modifications in the cylinder structure, limited robustness and life-time. Microwave technology is established in many fields e.g. communication, traffic radar or air-defence radar. In this paper we describe a minimally invasive and contactless implementation of this technology for hydraulic drives. The development of an industrial sensor has raised new challenges and lead to new sensing concepts. Finally our solutions, designs and test results are presented.
An experimental study on the interactions between surface waves and floating viscoelastic covers
 A possible mathematical ice model for the wave interactions in polar seas was developed based on the assumption that an ice cover behaved as a Voigt viscoelastic material. The dispersion relation was found to depend on the rheological properties of the cover. In the present study, an experimental approach was developed that can enable the verification of the theoretical predictions in the laboratory. The approach utilized the blended mixture of white oil and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material with various mass percentages of a curing agent, to create a floating layer with a range of targeted viscoelastic properties. Due to the large coverage required for wave flume experiments, special curing procedures were also established for the preparation of PDMS material. The rheological results showed that the mechanical behavior of the floating cover was close to a Voigt material. Experiments were conducted to analyze the wave interactions with the floating viscoelastic cover. The measured data showed an obvious change of wavelength when waves propagated along the cover region. It is observed that the change in wavelength can be linked quantitatively to the viscoelastic properties based on the numerical predictions by Wang and Shen (2010). Some differences were however noted for less viscous covers under longer wave periods. A direct comparison of the PDMS covers with a polypropylene (PP) cover was also performed for verification. Only wave lengthening was observed under the PP cover. With a shear modulus more than three orders of magnitude greater than that of PDMS, the theoretical wavelength for the PP cover from Wang and Shen (2010) is very close to that of the thin elastic plate theory from Fox and Squire (1990). Comparison between these two theoretical results and the measured data again deviated with longer wave periods. In both PDMS and PP cases, edge effects and pitching motion of the covers were present at various degrees. In addition, the materials were not strictly a Voigt type. The small deviation from the idealized rheological behavior could also contribute to differences between theoretical and experimental results.
A novel method for tracking individual waves in the surf zone
 A new method to obtain information on individual waves as they travel shoreward is described. The wave-tracking method involves analysis of synchronous water level records obtained from a shore-normal transect of pressure transducers (PTs). The method is illustrated here using data from field deployments inside the surf zone, although the method could equally be applied outside the surf zone. As a wave travels shoreward along the instrument transect it appears in the PT records at a progressively later time. Serial cross-correlation techniques are used to shift each record in time so that each wave in the first record aligns approximately with the corresponding wave (if it exists) in subsequent records from along the transect. A local minima analysis [Power et al., 2010] is used to delimit individual waves in each record and then parameters of interest can be determined for each wave at each PT location. The wave tracking method provides the evolution of these parameters for a single wave as it travels to shore, and they can be analysed as a function of distance or local water depth. The utility of the method is illustrated with case studies including the evolution of wave height and the evolution of the ratio of wave height to water depth for surf zone waves.
Influence of the volume speckle on fiber specklegram sensors based on four-wave mixing in photorefractive materials
 In this work, the dependence on the speckle size in the performance of a micro displacement sensor based on fiber specklegrams stored in a photorefractive BSO (Bi12SiO20) crystal is experimentally demonstrated. In our experimental setup, a plastic optical fiber (POF) was used to generate a subjective speckle pattern which was recorded in the crystal by using a four-wave mixing arrangement in transmission geometry. The speckle size was controlled by modifying the diameter of a pupil aperture adjacent to a lens producing the image of the speckle. The signal speckle beam was mixed into the crystal with two counter propagating pump beams to generate a fourth beam which is proportional to the conjugate of the original speckle beam. Real time fringe patterns were obtained at the output of the system by producing micro displacements of the fiber output end. Increases of the phase conjugation reflectivity and the visibility of the fringe patterns were appreciated when the speckle length was increased by decreasing the pupil aperture diameter. This behavior allowed recovering the autocorrelation functions of fringe patterns associated to micro displacements that initially led to decorrelation, and therefore, to improve the dynamic range of the metrological system. Until the best of our knowledge this is the first report about the influence of the speckle size on fiber specklegrams sensors recorded on photorefractive materials by four-wave mixing.
Investigation of optical knife edge sensor for low-cost, large-range and dual-axis nanopositioning stages
 We analyzed the parameter effects of an optical knife-edge sensor (OKES) and the measurement uncertainty to achieve high linearity, long range, and high accuracy for nanopositioning stage applications. The OKES utilizes interference fringes produced from diffraction across the knife-edge. The total field at the detector was calculated from superposition of the incident field and the diffracted field at the knife-edge, and the edge diffraction effects on the sensor design parameters (distance between the knife-edge and detector, wavelength and beam diameter) were investigated by using a design of experiment (DOE), 3-Level L9 matrix from the Taguchi Method. Multi-factor experiments were designed to determine the relationship between factors affecting the interferogram and the sensor linearity. It was found that a shorter knife edge-detector distance, shorter wavelength, and larger beam diameter show high signal-to-noise ratio for sensing linearity. The OKES was modeled by using the electromagnetic wave propagation principle, and it was experimentally verified by controlling the positioning of an XY nanopositioning stage by the OKES. The sensor noise level showed X 20.1 nm and Y 19.4 nm, and the fundamental sensing limits of the OKES were estimated to be X 0.19 nm/Hz and Y 0.23 nm/Hz for a ±1.0 mm working range. These results indicate that the OKES can be a good alternative to other precision metrology tools because of its large working range, positioning accuracy, resolution, linearity, and bandwidth, as well as its compact size and low cost.
A new 1.4-GHz soil moisture sensor
 Moisture content determination in agriculture and civil engineering is a common process which needs special sensors with high accuracy, durability and compatibility with the measurement environment. A new 1.4-GHz soil moisture sensor using microstrip transmission line is presented. The proposed sensor consists of two separate parts: (1) A sensor head, which is a microstrip transmission line to be placed in the soil, and (2) an electronic transceiver which sends a sinusoidal wave into the sensor head at one end of the transmission line, and receives the traveled wave from the other end. Transmitter is basically a Colpitts oscillator, and the receiver is a phase detector that measures the phase shift due to velocity variation caused by the moisture content of soil. At a certain frequency, the velocity of a microwave traveling through a media depends on the permittivity of that media. The proposed sensor is implemented and tested on one sample of typical soil. The main advantages of the proposed sensor are its high accuracy, quickness of measurement, its low cost and ease of implementation. Since the sensor has low power consumption, it can be recommended for low-power applications such as wireless sensor network.
Hybrid elastic-wave CT with impact acoustics for single-side measurement in concrete structures
 For maintenance of infrastructures, advanced inspection techniques applicable to diagnosis and prognosis are increasingly in great demands. Elastic-wave computed tomography (CT) is one of the techniques that have been extensively applied to the inspection of concrete structures. This conventional technique requires inputs being recorded and hence limits the number of inputs and relevant examined ray paths in acknowledging that the number of sensor is limited and sensor installation is time-consuming in the field. To tackle this difficulty, we presented a hybrid CT method by introducing the concept of acoustic emission (AE) localization to the conventional elastic wave CT, enabling simultaneous identification of both elastic-wave velocity distributions and input locations. With this hybrid method, the velocity distribution can be constructed with no input information required, implying a saving in number of sensor and in sensor installing time. It also implies that inputs can be performed arbitrary times at arbitrary locations for yielding sufficient examined path rays even with a limited number of receiving sensors. In this study, we applied this technique to the single-side tomography of surface waves excited by mechanical impacts. The feasibility of this hybrid CT method was illustrated on a 1.5 × 1.5 × 0.3 m concrete specimen and on a cracked concrete wall in field. Also, its superior efficiency and resolution was shown.
Micro- and nano-structure based oligonucleotide sensors
 This paper presents a review of micro- and nano-structure based oligonucleotide detection and quantification techniques. The characteristics of such devices make them very attractive for Point-of-Care or On-Site-Testing biosensing applications. Their small scale means that they can be robust and portable, their compatibility with modern CMOS electronics means that they can easily be incorporated into hand-held devices and their suitability for mass production means that, out of the different approaches to oligonucleotide detection, they are the most suitable for commercialisation. This review discusses the advantages of micro- and nano-structure based sensors and covers the various oligonucleotide detection techniques that have been developed to date. These include: Bulk Acoustic Wave and Surface Acoustic Wave devices, micro- and nano-cantilever sensors, gene Field Effect Transistors, and nanowire and nanopore based sensors. Oligonucleotide immobilisation techniques are also discussed.
Use of corn height measured with an acoustic sensor improves yield estimation with ground based active optical sensors
 Corn height measured manually has shown promising results in improving the relationship between active-optical (AO) sensor readings and crop yield. Manual measurement of corn height is not practical in US commercial corn production, so an alternative automatic method must be found in order to capture the benefit of including canopy height into in-season yield estimates and from there into in-season nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications. One existing alternative to measure canopy height is an acoustic height sensor. A commercial acoustic height sensor was utilized in these experiments at two corn growth stages (V6 and V12) along with AO sensors. Eight corn N rate sites in North Dakota, USA, were used to compare the acoustic height sensor as a practical alternative to manual height measurements as an additional parameter to increase the relationship between AO sensor readings and corn yield. Six N treatments, 0, 45, 90, 134, 179, and 224 kg ha−1, were applied before planting in a randomized complete block experimental design with four replications. Height measurement using the acoustic sensor provided an improved yield relationship compared to manual height at all locations. The level of improvement of the relationship between AO readings multiplied by acoustic sensor readings and yield was greater at V6 growth stage compared to the V12 growth stage. At V12, corn height measured manually and with the acoustic sensor multiplied by AO readings provided similar improvement to the relationship with yield compared to relating AO readings alone with yield at most locations. The acoustic height sensor may be useful in increasing the usefulness of AO sensor corn yield prediction algorithms for use in on-the-go in-season N application to corn particularly if the sensor height is normalized within site before combining multiple locations.
Determination of the anisotropy of elastic waves monitored by a sparse sensor network
 A method of velocity anisotropy analysis based on conventional ultrasonic transmission technique is proposed. Multiple transducers are used both to monitor acoustic emission and to measure velocities in different propagation directions. A sparse network of transducers located on the rock core surface allows approximation of elastic waves velocity distribution as an ellipsoidal surface. The shape and orientation of velocity ellipsoid is a measure of velocity anisotropy. A study of changes in velocity anisotropy and its orientation was performed on uniaxially loaded migmatite rock samples with distinct foliation. The velocity measurement was carried out during applying a uniaxial constant strain-rate loading. Orientation of the velocity ellipsoid corresponded to the anisotropy of rock structure up to activation of a failure plane. Prior to brittle failure, the axis of minimum velocity rotated from its initial direction normal to the foliation to a direction normal to the failure surface. The practical importance of the ellipsoid model lies in its simplicity and in its general applicability, which allows the use of measurement in a sparse sensor network. The use of time-variable ellipsoidal velocity model led to a better localization of acoustic emission events during the sample loading when compared to the use of time-variable isotropic velocity model. The position of the failure plane determined by clustering of acoustic events foci coincided closely with observed sample failure.
Advanced fault location in MTDC networks utilising optically-multiplexed current measurements and machine learning approach
 This paper presents a method for accurate fault localisation of DC-side faults in Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) networks utilising optically-multiplexed DC current measurements sampled at 5 kHz, off-line continuous wavelet transform and machine learning approach. The technical feasibility of optically-based DC current measurements is evaluated through laboratory experiments using commercially available equipment. Simulation-based analysis through Matlab/Simulink® has been adopted to test the proposed fault location algorithm under different fault types and locations along a DC grid. Results revealed that the proposed fault location scheme can accurately calculate the location of a fault and successfully identify its type. The scheme has been also found to be effective for highly resistive fault with resistances of up to 500Ω. Further sensitivity analysis revealed that the proposed scheme is relatively robust to additive noise and synchronisation errors.
Wave energy conversion using fluidic flexible matrix composite power take-off pumps
 Fluidic flexible matrix composites (F2MCs) are composite tubes that consist of multiple layers of oriented, high performance fibers, such as carbon, precisely placed in a flexible matrix resin to form high-mechanical advantage actuators and variable stiffness materials. Unique to the F2MC tube is its ability to generate high pressures and volume change with a small external load as a result of the stiff reinforcement fiber orientation in the wall of the tube and the soft supporting elastomer. When a load is applied to the tubes, the volume of the F2MC tube is reduced and fluid is forced out of the tube by the reinforcing fibers. This is the first reported research on the design, fabrication, and characterization of F2MC tubes as power take-off (PTO) mechanisms for ocean wave energy conversion where the heaving motion of a floating body in waves provides the axial load that drives fluid through the pumps. An analytical model is developed to predict the performance of F2MC pumps in a variety of test conditions, and 1/50th scale F2MCs pumps are tested in a water basin. The scaled pumps are mechanically cycled between 0 Hz and 2 Hz at up to 17 percent strain replicating ocean waves of varying period and amplitude. Instantaneous input mechanical power and output fluid power values are calculated from force, velocity, pressure, and flow rate measurements, and the actuator efficiency is subsequently determined and compared with the prediction of the analytical model. At 1/50th scale, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 40 percent is obtained for a single pump and a peak output power of 0.21 W is recorded. At full scale, the predicted peak output power is 180 kW, suggesting that F2MC pumps are a promising class of fluid power take-off (PTO) mechanisms for ocean wave energy conversion, representing a substantial improvement over hydraulic cylinders.
Applying variational theory to travel time estimation on urban arterials
 The Variational Theory (VT) expresses the LWR model as a least cost path problem. Recent researches have shown that this problem can be simply applied on a graph with a minimal number of nodes and edges when the fundamental diagram is triangular (sufficient variational graph – SVG). Such a graph accounts for traffic signal settings on an urban arterial and leads to mean traffic states for the total arterial in free-flow or congested stationary conditions. The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) can then be directly estimated. In this paper, we extend this method to provide the complete distribution of deterministic travel times observed on an arterial. First, we will show how to obtain a tight estimation of the arterial capacity by properly identifying the most constraining part of the SVG. Then, we will show that a modified version of the SVG allows the exact calculation of the cumulative count curves at the entry and exit of an arterial. It is finally possible to derive the full travel time distributions for any dynamic conditions.
Spin wave filtering and guiding in Permalloy/iron nanowires
 We have investigated the spin wave filtering and guiding properties of periodic array of single (Permalloy and Fe) and bi-layer (Py/Fe) nanowires (NWs) by means of Brillouin light scattering measurements and micromagnetic simulations. For all the nanowire arrays, the thickness of the layers is 10 nm while all NWs have the same width of 340 nm and edge-to-edge separation of 100 nm. Spin wave dispersion has been measured in the Damon-Eshbach configuration for wave vector either parallel or perpendicular to the nanowire length. This study reveals the filtering property of the spin waves when the wave vector is perpendicular to the NW length, with frequency ranges where the spin wave propagation is permitted separated by frequency band gaps, and the guiding property of NW when the wave vector is oriented parallel to the NW, with spin wave modes propagating in parallel channels in the central and edge regions of the NW. The measured dispersions were well reproduced by micromagnetic simulations, which also deliver the spatial profiles for the modes at zero wave vector. To reproduce the dispersion of the modes localized close to the NW edges, uniaxial anisotropy has been introduced. In the case of Permalloy/iron NWs, the obtained results have been compared with those for a 20 nm thick effective NW having average magnetic properties of the two materials.
Optimal submergence of horizontal plates for maximum wave energy dissipation
 Rubble-mound breakwaters are widely used for beach protection and generate shelter zones in the water, although their feasibility diminishes as water depth increases, due mainly to construction costs. In this paper an alternative structure, a fixed submerged horizontal plate, is tested in the hope that such a design may be a practical engineering option for the protection of small ports and marinas, and/or providing a sheltered zone for recreational purposes. The interaction of irregular unidirectional-waves with the plates was studied using CADMAS-SURF software and validated experimentally. Several non-dimensional parameters were tested in order to evaluate their contribution in dissipating the incoming waves. Results suggest that energy loss depends to a large degree on the combination of the relative depth, wave steepness, relative thickness, relative length and relative submergence, with the last being the most important, as it significantly affects the wave-plate interaction. The plate produces greatest dissipation when placed at a depth of 3% of the water column. It should therefore be deployed near the surface and in regions with low tidal range conditions. Plate lengths of 20% of the incoming wavelength and a relative thickness of 0.08 are recommended to produce greater energy dissipation with lower transmission and reflection.
Guided waves for debonding identification in CFRP-reinforced concrete beams
 Ultrasonic guided waves excited and sensed by surface-bonded piezoelectric wafers were simulated and used to quantitatively evaluate the debonding between concrete beams and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) overlay. Eight concrete specimens reinforced by composite overlay were prepared with different bonding conditions, which were simulated by inserting different sizes of Teflon films when the overlay was cured. A continuous wavelet transform based signal processing method was implemented to filter out broad-band environmental noise in the experiments. In consideration of the inevitable discrepancies in different specimens due to concrete preparation and sensor installation, a time-reversal process was applied to individual specimens to achieve self-comparison between the originally emitted and reconstructed wave signals which were sent back to the actuator. That procedure highlighted discrepancies in specimens, caused by different debonding conditions. Debonding indices were successfully calculated to quantify the severity of debonding, showing the potential of guided waves for integrity evaluation of CFRP-reinforced concrete structures.
Characterization of impinging jet sprays of gelled propellants loaded with nanoparticles in the impact wave regime
 This study presents impact wave and spray properties for sheet breakup of rheologically complex gelled propellants using high-speed visualization and image processing. Two converging high-aspect ratio nozzles formed sheets for pressure drops in the range 414–828 kPa. Metalized gelled propellants are simulated using 0–20 wt% alumina nanoparticles suspended in a gelled rocket propellant. Spatio-temporal analysis of the impact waves formed on the sheet surface is presented for the first time and wave properties are compared against other liquids undergoing sheet breakup. Impact waves propagate in primary breakup region with constant velocity much less than jets. Unlike in Newtonian liquids, wave propagation velocity smaller than jet velocity delays the breakup of gelled propellants. Breakup length of the gelled propellant sheet varied with Weber number in a similar manner to impinging water jets. However, linear instability theories describing sheet breakup of Newtonian fluids could not describe the relationship between breakup length and Weber number. Bulk jets of 0.001 m diameter broke up into droplets of Sauter mean diameters 200–400 µm. Smaller size in this range is observed in the sheet periphery and near to the impingement region. Larger size occurs in the middle regions of sheet towards downstream. Externally impinging jets must overcome the rheological resistance of gelled propellants by imparting higher kinetic energy to the sheet. This invariably results in higher velocities of the propellant jets for a given orifice diameter. Thus, a smaller injector parameter is obtained and results of this study suggest that this operational limitation could induce combustion instability.
Visualization observation of onset and damping behaviors in a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine by infrared imaging
 To explore the effects of Gedeon streaming on the onset and damping behaviors, infrared imaging is applied for the first time in a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine to observe the temperature evolution of the regenerator. Under conditions of with and without Gedeon streaming, the temperature distribution differences of the regenerator in the onset and damping processes are compared and analyzed. Based on the visual images, the dimensionless temperature distribution reveals some phenomena that have not been revealed by traditional measurement methods. Analysis of the thermal and mass flows is made to further understand the mechanism of the onset and damping processes.
In situ observations of dust particles in Martian dust belts using a large-sensitive-area dust sensor
 In order to determine whether Martian dust belts (ring or torus) actually exist and, if so, to determine the characteristics of the dust, we propose a Circum-Martian Dust Monitor (CMDM) to be deployed on the Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) project, in which JAXA plans to launch the spacecraft in 2024, investigate Phobos and Deimos, and return samples back to Earth. The CMDM is a newly developed instrument that is an impact dust detector. It weighs only 650 g and has a sensor aperture area of ∼1 m2, according to the conceptual design study. Detectable velocities (v) range from 0.5 km/s to more than 70 km/s, which will cover all possible dust particles: circummartian (low v), interplanetary (mid v), and interstellar (high v) particles. The measurable mass ranges from 1.3 × 10−9 g to 7.8 × 10−7 g at v = 0.5 km/s. Since the MMX spacecraft will take a quasi-circular, prograde orbit around Mars, the CMDM will be able to investigate particles from Phobos and Deimos with relative velocities lower than 1 km/s. Therefore, the CMDM will be able to determine whether or not a confined dust ring exists along Phobos' orbit and whether an extended dust torus exists along Deimos' orbit. It may also be able to clarify whether or not any such ring or torus are self-sustained.
Development of Ultrasonic Guided Wave Inspection Methodology for Steam Generator Tubes of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor
 An ultrasonic guided wave based methodology is developed for inspection of steam generator tubes of the prototype fast breeder reactor. To this aim, axisymmetric longitudinal mode (L(0,2)) at the frequency of 250 kHz is optimized using 3D-finite element simulation and experiments. The group velocity of mode L(0,2) at 250 kHz is found to be 5387 m/s. First, the long range propagation of the L(0,2) mode at 250 kHz is examined and the mode is found to propagate over a distance of 45.6 m with a sufficiently good SNR. Secondly, the detection of multiple defects such as circumferential, axial, partial-pinholes and tapered defects lying in the same line of sight is investigated using 3D-finite element simulation and the results obtained are validated experimentally for the first three cases. The sensitivities achieved are 0.23 mm depth (10%WT) for circumferential, axial and tapered defects and for partial-pinholes: 1 mm diameter and 1.38 mm depth (60%WT). Thirdly, 3D-FE simulations with ID and OD pinhole defects are performed which show that the ID and OD defects are detected by L(0,2) with a fairly similar sensitivity. Finally, study on the thermal expansion bend (with three successive bends) shows that the bend does not have much influence on the mode and the multiple circumferential defects considered in the bend are detected with good sensitivity.
Time-frequency analysis of ship wave patterns in shallow water: modelling and experiments
 A spectrogram of a ship wake is a heat map that visualises the time-dependent frequency spectrum of surface height measurements taken at a single point as the ship travels by. Spectrograms are easy to compute and, if properly interpreted, have the potential to provide crucial information about various properties of the ship in question. Here we use geometrical arguments and analysis of an idealised mathematical model to identify features of spectrograms, concentrating on the effects of a finite-depth channel. Our results depend heavily on whether the flow regime is subcritical or supercritical. To support our theoretical predictions, we compare with data taken from experiments we conducted in a model test basin using a variety of realistic ship hulls. Finally, we note that vessels with a high aspect ratio appear to produce spectrogram data that contains periodic patterns. We can reproduce this behaviour in our mathematical model by using a so-called two-point wavemaker. These results highlight the role of wave interference effects in spectrograms of ship wakes.
Void fraction and pressure waves in a transient horizontal slug flow
 The void fraction and the pressure waves in an air–water mixture flowing in the slug regime are experimentally investigated in a horizontal line. The test section is made of a transparent Plexiglas pipe with 26 mm ID and 26.24 m long, operating at ambient temperature and pressure. The flow induced transients are made by quickly changing the air or the water inlet velocity. The test grid has four operational points. This choice allows one to create expansion and compression waves due to the changes to the gas or to the liquid. Each experimental run is repeated 100 times to extract an ensemble average capable of filtering out the intrinsic flow intermittence and disclosing the void fraction and pressure waves’ features. The slug flow properties such as the bubble nose translational velocity, the lengths of liquid film underneath the bubble and the liquid slug are also measured. The objective of the work is two-fold: access the main characteristics of the void fraction and pressure waves and disclose the mechanics of the transient slug flow as described through the changes of the slug flow properties.
Wave forcing and morphological changes of New Caledonia lagoon islets: Insights on their possible relations
 In the present study, we examine how waves may contribute to the morphological changes of islets in the New Caledonia lagoon. We collected in situ wave data to investigate their characteristics. Three types of waves are identified and quantified: (1) high-frequency waves generated within the lagoon, (2) low-frequency waves originating from swells in the Tasman Sea, and (3) infragravity waves. We found out that high-frequency waves are the dominant forcing on the islets during typical wind events throughout the year, while infragravity waves, likely generated by the breaking of low-frequency waves, dominate during seasonal swell events. During swell events, low-frequency waves can also directly propagate to the islets through channels across the barrier reef, or be tidally modulated across the barrier reef before reaching the islets. Topographic surveys and beach profiles on one islet indicate areas with seasonal morphological changes and other areas with longer, interannual or decadal, erosion patterns. Although more data are needed to validate this hypothesis, we suspect that a relation exists between wave forcing and morphological changes of the islets.
Self-adaptive method for high frequency seismic surface wave method
 When the high frequency multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method is conducted to explore soil properties in the vadose zone, existing rules for selecting the near offset and spread lengths cannot satisfy the requirements of planar dominant Rayleigh waves for all frequencies of interest and will inevitably introduce near and far field effects as well as spatial aliases at certain frequencies. To solve these problems, a self-adaptive method is developed to determine high frequency dispersion trends. In this method, an initial dispersion curve is obtained by a fixed-offset MASW method and used to estimate wavelengths at all frequencies of interest. At each frequency, the near offset and spread lengths are then set to be 0.2–0.6 and 2–4 wavelengths respectively. In other words, the near offset and spread lengths are self-adaptive to the corresponding wavelength. Furthermore, in order to avoid spatial aliases and minimize the number of sensors or sensor locations, a variable sensor spacing configuration is proposed, in which the spacing for the first 120 steps is set to be 0.5 cm and the next 40 steps start with 1 cm spacing followed by 1 cm incremental spacing for each subsequent step. In this study, an accelerometer was used as a sensor to detect surface vibrations generated by an electrodynamic shaker operating in chirp mode. Two field tests were conducted and the results from the fixed-offset, self-adaptive, and variable spacing MASW methods were compared. The study demonstrates the ability of the self-adaptive MASW method to preferentially identify the dispersion trends of either the fundamental mode or higher modes of Rayleigh waves. It is also found that the dispersion trends can be determined beyond the source frequency range due to nonlinear effects that generate high harmonics of surface waves. This nonlinear phenomenon deserves future investigation.
Optimisation of focused wave group runup on a plane beach
 Insight is provided into focused wave group runup on a plane beach by means of laboratory wave flume experiments and numerical simulations. A focused wave group is presented as an alternative to an empirical description of the wave conditions leading to extreme runup. Second-order correction to the laboratory wavemaker generation signal is observed to remove about 60% of the sub-harmonic error wave that would otherwise contaminate coastal response experiments. Laboratory measurements of the wave runup time history are obtained using inclined resistance-type wires and copper strips attached to the beach surface. The numerical wave runup model is based on hybrid Boussinesq-Nonlinear Shallow Water equations, empirical parameters for wave breaking and bed friction, and a wetting and drying algorithm. After calibration against experimental runup data, the numerical model reproduces satisfactorily the propagation, shoaling and runup of focused wave groups over the entire length of the wave flume. Results from a comprehensive parametric study show that both measured and predicted maximum runup elevations exhibit strong dependence on the linear focus amplitude of the wave group (linked to its probability of occurrence), the focus location, and the phase of the wave group at focus. The results also demonstrate that extreme runup events owing to focused wave incidence cannot be characterised using spectral parameters alone. The optimal band of focus locations shifts onshore as linear focus amplitude of the incident wave group increases. Optimisation of phase and focus location leads to a maximum runup elevation at each linear amplitude, and, when generated using second-order corrected paddle signals, the maximum runup appears to approach saturation at very large focused wave amplitudes. This study therefore moves beyond simple wave focusing, and presents a focused wave group as a tool for investigating the relationship between extremes within an incident wave field and extreme wave runup.
Big Sensor Data Applications in Urban Environments
 The emergence of new technologies such as Internet/Web/Network-of-Things and large scale wireless sensor systems enables the collection of data from an increasing volume and variety of networked sensors for analysis. In this review article, we summarize the latest developments of big sensor data systems (a term to conceptualize the application of the big data model towards networked sensor systems) in various representative studies for urban environments, including for air pollution monitoring, assistive living, disaster management systems, and intelligent transportation. An important focus is the inclusion of how value is extracted from the big data system. We also discuss some recent techniques for big data acquisition, cleaning, aggregation, modeling, and interpretation in large scale sensor-based systems. We conclude the paper with a discussion on future perspectives and challenges of sensor-based data systems in the big data era.
Liquid refractometer based mirrorless fiber optic displacement sensor
 Liquid refractometer based mirrorless fiber optic displacement sensor is proposed and demonstrated. Various liquid samples with refractive index in the range of 1.333–1.433 RIU were used as modulator. The refractometer sensor was operated based on intensity modulation with regard to displacement sensor. Each of the tested samples has its own fingerprint. This allows the performance of the sensor to be quantified based on the front slope, back slope and peak voltage. The peak voltage is optimized at constant displacement of 3 mm. The sensitivity of the refractometer sensor based mirrorless fiber optic displacement sensor is achieved as 188.37 mV/mm/RIU with repeatability of 99.87% and resolution of 0.00531RIU. The sensor work based on the peak voltage. The higher the peak voltage means the higher the refractive index of the liquid medium. The collection of more lights entering into the receiver is realized due to the contribution from the reflectivity of the surface liquid. Such mirrorless liquid refractometer sensor offering many advantages including the simplicity, easier, faster and cheaper compared to conventional refractometer.
Improving the analysis of biogeochemical patterns associated with internal waves in the strait of Gibraltar using remote sensing images
 High Amplitude Internal Waves (HAIWs) are physical processes observed in the Strait of Gibraltar (the narrow channel between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea). These internal waves are generated over the Camarinal Sill (western side of the strait) during the tidal outflow (toward the Atlantic Ocean) when critical hydraulic conditions are established. HAIWs remain over the sill for up to 4 h until the outflow slackens, being then released (mostly) towards the Mediterranean Sea. These have been previously observed using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which captures variations in surface water roughness. However, in this work we use high resolution optical remote sensing, with the aim of examining the influence of HAIWs on biogeochemical processes. We used hyperspectral images from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and high spatial resolution (10 m) images from the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2A satellite. This work represents the first attempt to examine the relation between internal wave generation and the water constituents of the Camarinal Sill using hyperspectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing images. This enhanced spatial and spectral resolution revealed the detailed biogeochemical patterns associated with the internal waves and suggests local enhancements of productivity associated with internal waves trains.
Vehicle Index Estimation for Signalized Intersections Using Sample Travel Times
 We introduce in this paper the concept of vehicle indices in a cycle at a signalized intersection which are the positions of vehicles in the departure process of the cycle. We show that vehicle indices are closely relate to the vehicle arrival and the departure processes at the intersection. Based on vehicle indices and sample travel times collected from mobile sensors, a three-layer Bayesian Network model is constructed to describe the stochastic intersection traffic flow by capturing the relationship of vehicle indices, and the arrivals and departure processes. The non-homogeneous Poisson process and log- normal distributions are used respectively to model the stochastic arrival and departure processes. The methods of parameter learning and vehicle index inference are presented based on the observed intersection travel times. Simplification to the methods is discussed to reduce the computational effort of parameter learning and vehicle index estimation. The model is tested using data from NGSIM, field test, and simulation with reasonable results.
Design of a guided wave absorber for Structural Health Monitoring system development
 The objective of this paper is to present and validate an efficient guided wave absorber for increased sensitivity of structural health monitoring systems based on guided wave, and especially for inspection close to structure boundaries. Such an absorber would also help with systematic characterization of guided waves interaction with defects in aerospace structures. A complete numerical parametric study is undertaken using the power flow in the structure to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients and thus the dissipated energy by the absorber. Starting with the determination of the geometry and dimensions using Finite Element Modelling (FEM), and following with an investigation on the influence of the absorber's mechanical properties, a practical and efficient absorber is identified. The dimensions of the developed absorber are minimized to provide optimal results for frequencies ranging from 50 kHz to 500 kHz for an incident A0 mode. The resulting right triangle cross section absorber of Teflon has been machined and tested experimentally using a piezoelectric wave generator on one side of the absorber, and a tri-dimensional laser Doppler vibrometer (3D-LDV) to measure the transmitted wave on the other side. Using a spatial Fourier transform approach for the determination of the experimental reflection and transmission coefficients, the numerical results have been successfully validated.
Wave-based vibration control of large cable net structures
 Large cable net structures have been widely applied in aerospace engineering due to the feature of light-weight, high packaging efficiency, and high thermal stability. Structural vibrations induced by a variety of disturbances are inevitable in the space environment, resulting in the requirement of effective vibration control strategies for large cable net structures. Since the large cable net structures have many closely spaced vibrational modes in the range of low frequencies, traditional modal based control may cause modal truncation and spillover problems. In this paper, a wave-based boundary control strategy is adopted and its effectiveness to control the vibration of cable net structures is investigated, by transfer function analysis and numerical methods. It is found that the structural vibration can be absolutely resisted by applying the wave-based boundary controllers onto all the exterior nodes, when disturbances come from the external boundaries of the cable net. Our results in this paper can provide a theoretical basis for the vibration control of large cable net structures.
Modeling and experimental verification of polarization errors in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor
 Every optical state polarization in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor (S-FOCS) is restricted in specific stage theoretically. However, complex transforming processes of optical state polarization induce illegal linear optical state polarization and illegal circular optical state polarization in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor, then, decrease performance of S-FOCS. According to the parameters of the optical components, we built Jones matrixes and the mathematical model of optical transmission in S-FOCS. Based on polarization state error models of Sagnac fiber optic current sensor, we made experiments to evaluate performances of several key components, including polarizer, quarter-wave retarder and sensing head, then, investigate the influence of several main polarization error factors on S-FOCS's performance practically. The result shows that the changing degree of polarization state causes bias instability, nonlinear of scale ratio, and random noises of S-FOCS, and influents S-FOCS's performance.
Patterning microparticles into a two-dimensional pattern using one column standing surface acoustic waves
 The patterning of micro particles in microfluidic networks is important for many biological and medical applications. In this paper, the micro particles patterns that driven by standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) are investigated in microchannel. A two-dimensional particle pattern is formed by the micro particles under the actuation of one column SSAW. Two forces, i.e., chaining force generated by interaction of polarized particles, and acoustic radiated force (ARF) generated by the surface acoustic wave (SAW), should dominate the particles assembling process. The intricate and interesting interplay between acoustic radiation force and chaining force on the particles is studied. The analysis and experiment reveal that the ARF drives the particles to form broken line along the nodal line (one-dimensional particle pattern) where the ARF is zero and the chaining force can dominate the particles to form array points (two-dimensional particle pattern) in the area of node. The results will be useful for deeply understanding the particles moving and precisely control the particles patterns induced by SSAW.
Shear lag solution for tuning ultrasonic piezoelectric wafer active sensors with applications to Lamb wave array imaging
 An analytical investigation of the interaction between piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS), guided Lamb waves, and host structure is presented in this paper, supported with application examples. The analytical investigation assumes a PWAS transducer bonded to the upper surface of an isotropic flat plate. Shear lag transfer of tractions and strains is assumed, and an analytical solution using the space-wise Fourier transform is reviewed, closed-form solutions are presented for the case of both ideal bonding (i.e., load transfer mechanism localized at the PWAS boundary) and not ideal bonding (i.e., load transfer mechanism localized close the PWAS boundary). The analytical solutions are used to derive Lamb wave mode tuning curves which indicate that frequencies exist at which the A0 mode or the S0 mode can be either suppressed or enhanced. The paper further shows that the capability to excite only one desired Lamb wave mode is critical for practical structural health monitoring applications such as PWAS phased array technique (e.g., the embedded ultrasonics structural radar, EUSR) and the sparse array imaging. Extensive experimental tests that verify the tuning mechanism and prediction curves are reported. Examples of correctly tuned EUSR images vs. detuned cases illustrate the paramount importance of Lamb wave mode tuning for the success of PWAS based damage detection.
Shear-wave velocity structure of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre, New Zealand: Fast Rayleigh and slow Love waves indicate strong shallow anisotropy
 Models of the velocity structure of volcanoes can help define possible magma pathways and contribute to calculating more accurate earthquake locations, which can help with monitoring volcanic activity. However, shear-wave velocity of volcanoes is difficult to determine from traditional seismic techniques, such as local earthquake tomography (LET) or refraction/reflection surveys. Here we use the recently developed technique of noise cross correlation of continuous seismic data to investigate the subsurface shear-wave velocity structure of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre (TgVC) of New Zealand, focusing on the active Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. We observe both the fundamental and first higher-order modes of Rayleigh and Love waves within our noise dataset, made from stacks of 15 min cross-correlation functions. We manually pick group velocity dispersion curves from over 1900 correlation functions, of which we consider 1373 to be high quality. We subsequently invert a subset of the fundamental mode Rayleigh- and Love-wave dispersion curves both independently and jointly for one dimensional shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles at Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. Vs increases very slowly at a rate of approximately 0.2 km/s per km depth beneath Ruapehu, suggesting that progressive hydrothermal alteration mitigates the effects of compaction driven velocity increases. At Tongariro, we observe larger Vs increases with depth, which we interpret as different layers within Tongariro's volcanic system above altered basement greywacke. Slow Vs, on the order of 1–2 km/s, are compatible with P-wave velocities (using a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.7) from existing velocity profiles of areas within the TgVC, and the observations of worldwide studies of shallow volcanic systems that used ambient noise cross-correlation methods. Most of the measured group velocities of fundamental mode Love-waves across the TgVC are 0.1–0.4 km/s slower than those of fundamental mode Rayleigh-waves in the frequency range of 0.25–1 Hz. First-higher mode Love-waves are similarly slower than first-higher mode Rayleigh waves. This is incompatible with synthetic dispersion curves we calculate using isotropic, layered velocity models appropriate for Ruapehu and Tongariro, in which Love waves travel more quickly than Rayleigh waves of the same period. The Love-Rayleigh discrepancy is likely due to structures such as dykes or cracks in the vertical plane having increased influence on surface-wave propagation. However, several measurements at Ruapehu have Love-wave group velocities that are faster than Rayleigh-wave group velocities. The differences between the Love- and Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves also vary with the azimuth of the interstation path across Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. Significant azimuthal dependence of both Love and Rayleigh-wave velocities are also observed. This suggests azimuthal anisotropy within the volcanic structures, which coupled with radial anisotropy, makes the Vs structures of Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes anisotropic with orthorhombic or lower order symmetry. We suggest that further work to determine three-dimensional volcanic structures should include provisions for such anisotropy.
Online condition monitoring of MV cable feeders using Rogowski coil sensors for PD measurements
 Condition monitoring is a highly effective prognostic tool for incipient insulation degradation to avoid sudden failures of electrical components and to keep the power network in operation. Improved operational performance of the sensors and effective measurement techniques could enable the development of a robust monitoring system. This paper addresses two main aspects of condition monitoring: an enhanced design of an induction sensor that has the capability of measuring partial discharge (PD) signals emerging simultaneously from medium voltage cables and transformers, and an integrated monitoring system that enables the monitoring of a wider part of the cable feeder. Having described the conventional practices along with the authors’ own experiences and research on non-intrusive solutions, this paper proposes an optimum design of a Rogowski coil that can measure the PD signals from medium voltage cables, its accessories, and the distribution transformers. The proposed PD monitoring scheme is implemented using the directional sensitivity capability of Rogowski coils and a suitable sensor installation scheme that leads to the development of an integrated monitoring model for the components of a MV cable feeder. Furthermore, the paper presents forethought regarding huge amount of PD data from various sensors using a simplified and practical approach. In the perspective of today’s changing grid, the presented idea of integrated monitoring practices provide a concept towards automated condition monitoring.
Hacking a soil water content reflectometer to measure liquid level
 A method for converting a soil water reflectometer to a water level sensor is presented. The sensor essentially records the time of travel of an electromagnetic pulse along two parallel rods, which is then used to infer the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the medium around these two rods. While the sensor is designed to capture the relative permittivity variation of soil with its moisture content, the immersion depth of the rods in water (or potentially other dielectric liquids) also influences the average dielectric constant of the air-water medium between the rods (consequently affecting its permittivity). Here we show how this change in permittivity can be calibrated to measure small liquid depths. An empirical calibration equation is developed; it accounts for the impact of water salinity, whereas the temperature effect on the measurements is shown to be negligible.
Non-destructive inspection of ground anchors using guided wave propagation
 This paper deals with numerical and experimental investigations of specific problems of guided wave propagation in ground anchors, focussing on recognizing the phenomenon of the energy transfer between anchor components. Particular attention is paid to characteristic features of guided waves propagating in free and embedded parts of the tendon, at the interface between the tendon and the surrounding anchor body, as well as waves diffracted on the start of the anchor body. Anchors with variable lengths and diameters of the anchor body, as well as anchors with non-reflecting boundary conditions, are analysed numerically. Experimental measurements are conducted on laboratory models of ground anchors of different fixed lengths. The study shows that the detailed recognition of the phenomenon of the transfer of the wave energy between the tendon and the anchor body is crucial for the appropriate application of the guided wave propagation method for non-destructive inspection of ground anchors. The obtained results indicate that the three most important geometric parameters, i.e. the anchor body length, the free length of the tendon and the thickness of the anchor body, can be determined on the basis of wave propagation signals recorded at the free end of the anchor.
Bathymetric control on the spatial distribution of wave breaking in the surf zone of a natural beach
 A non-hydrostatic wave model (SWASH) that phase-resolves the free surface and fluid motions in the water column is applied to investigate wave transformation and the spatial distribution of wave breaking over different morphological features. The model is forced using observed directional energy spectra and results are compared to wave observations collected outside the surf zone using acoustic wave sensors, and over a 100 m nearshore transect using high-frequency measurements of the sea surface from a LIDAR sensor mounted on the beach dune at the Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. The model is applied to four cases with different wave conditions and bathymetry, tested for sensitivity of model parameters to these different natural conditions, and used to predict the spatial variability in wave breaking and correlation between energy dissipation and morphologic features. Model results compare very well with observations of spectral evolution outside the surf zone, and generally well with the remotely sensed observations of wave transformation inside the surf zone with R = 0.85-0.93 for Hs along the cross-shore transect. In particular the model is able to spatially resolve wave shoaling and dissipation at the shore break at the same location as observed in the LIDAR data. The results indicate that nearshore morphology has a significant effect on the spatial distribution of wave energy dissipation. Alongshore variability in bathymetry due to bars, rip channels, and larger morphological features such as the scour depression under the pier, causes large alongshore changes in cross-shore wave energy flux that influence the location and intensity of wave breaking.
Effects of Various Factors on Performance of MAC Protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks
 Research on underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) is an emerging area. This domain offers challenges and opportunities dynamically. Acoustic communication is one of the most mature technologies in this domain. Existing medium access control (MAC) protocol for terrestrial WSNs are not sufficient to solve the issues in UWSNs due to their limitations. Therefore, to design a new MAC protocols for UWSNs, it is required to study the factors which can affect the performance of MAC protocols in underwater environment. In this paper, we highlight the factors which cause degradation of performance for MAC protocol in terms of energy efficiency. In addition, this paper also focuses on simulation-based experimental results to compare the performance of MAC protocols under data rate factor.
Viscoelastic shock wave in ballistic gelatin behind soft body armor
 Ballistic gelatins are widely used as a surrogate of biological tissue in blunt trauma tests. Non-penetration impact tests of handgun bullets on the 10 wt% ballistic gelatin block behind soft armor were carried out in which a high-speed camera recorded the crater׳s movement and pressure sensors imbedded in the gelatin block recorded the pressure waves at different locations. The observed shock wave attenuation indicates the necessity of considering the gelatin׳s viscoelasticity. A three-element viscoelastic constitutive model was adopted, in which the relevant parameters were obtained via fitting the damping free oscillations at the beginning of the creep-mode of rheological measurement, and by examining the data of published split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. The viscoelastic model is determined by a retardation time of 5.5×10−5 s for high oscillation frequencies and a stress relaxation time of 2.0–4.5×10−7 s for shock wave attenuation. Using the characteristic-line method and the spherical wave assumption, the propagation of impact pressure wave front and the subsequent unloading profile can be simulated using the experimental velocity boundary condition. The established viscoelastic model considerably improves the prediction of shock wave attenuation in the ballistic gelatin.
Fiber Optic Sensors in the Oil and Gas Industry

Where applicable, descriptions of the different extraction techniques will be explained. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of potential future directions.
Self-sustained, high-frequency detonation wave generation in a semi-bounded channel
 Combustion dynamics in a linear, semi-bounded channel were studied to characterize injection, mixing, and ignition processes in a two dimensional analogue of a rotating detonation wave combustor. The linear channel was developed to operate using natural gas and oxygen and to provide large optical accessibility in support of high-fidelity diagnostics at thermal power density levels representative of rotating detonation wave combustors over a broad range of flow conditions. Measurements of pressure and heat release were performed using an array of high-frequency dynamic pressure probes and OH*-chemiluminescence, respectively. Self-sustained, periodic generation of detonation waves was observed. These traveling combustion waves were initiated from low amplitude deflagrative fronts and steepened as they traveled through the combustion channel. The sensitivity of this instability to changes in acoustic boundary conditions was explored to determine the origin of the high-amplitude dynamics. The change in acoustic boundary at the end-wall affected the transverse acoustic mode frequency as expected, but had no effect on the detonation wave initiation. The detonation wave dynamics were found to be correlated with resonant frequencies in the propellant manifolds. It was determined that the frequency of the self-sustained chamber dynamics depends on which manifold has the strongest injection pressure ratio. OH*-chemiluminescence and pressure measurements indicate that the observed transition to detonation is linked to the auto-ignition of the reactants and that the auto-ignition event is coupled with the fluctuation in reactant mass flow associated with the manifold dynamics.
Prototype of a compact displacement sensor with a holographic diffraction grating
 This paper discusses a compact displacement sensor which is constructed with a volume holographic diffraction grating. The sensor is integrated with a heterodyne interferometer. The best sensitivity can be better than 1 pm and the displacement error better than 28 nm within a traveling range of 2.5 mm. According to long-term static position observations, the stability of the proposed sensor is 10 times better than the apparatus to which it is compared. Furthermore, measurement of the thermal expansion properties of the hologram shows that the grating pitch variation is less than 0.1 nm as long as the temperature variation remains within 1 °C. Based on these results, the holographic diffraction grating has the potential to measure displacement with high sensitivity, high stability, and reduced measurement error.
Advanced Optical Incremental Sensors
 In this chapter the principles of displacement metrology by optical incremental sensors are given. First the basic concepts of displacement interferometer systems as well as their signal processing and error sources are reviewed. Then the concepts of optical encoder systems and some of their design considerations are discussed.
Irregular deep ocean wave energy attenuation using a cycloidal wave energy converter
 The performance of a lift based wave energy converter in unidirectional irregular deep ocean waves is investigated. The energy converter consists of two hydrofoils attached parallel to a horizontal main shaft at a radius. The main shaft is aligned parallel to the wave crests and submerged at a fixed depth. The local flow field induced by the incident wave will cause the hydrofoils to rotate about the main shaft. The orientation of each hydrofoil is adjusted to produce the desired level of bound circulation. The energy converter and incident wave field are modeled using potential flow theory. The wave field is assumed to be long-crested and the hydrofoil span infinitely long, thereby the resulting flow field is two-dimensional. Each hydrofoil is modeled as a point vortex moving under a free surface. The irregular ocean wave is modeled by linear superposition of a finite number of regular wave components. The amplitude and frequency of each component is determined based on a Bretschneider spectrum. The hydrofoil position and bound circulation are controlled using a sensor located up-wave of the device and wave state estimator. The results demonstrate the converter’s ability to effectively extract energy from multiple wave components simultaneously. Inviscid hydrodynamic efficiencies for incident wave fields consisting of 7 and 10 regular wave components were 85% and 77%, respectively.
A theoretical basis for standing and traveling brain waves measured with human EEG with implications for an integrated consciousness
 We propose a theoretical framework for EEG and evoked potential studies based on the single postulate that these data are composed of a combination of waves (as this term is used in the physical sciences) and thalamocortical network activity. Using known properties of traveling and standing waves, independent of any neocortical dynamic theory, our simple postulate leads to experimental predictions, several of which have now been verified. A mathematical–physiological theory of “brain waves” based on known (but highly idealized) properties of cortical synaptic action and corticocortical fibers is used to support the framework. Brain waves are predicted with links between temporal frequencies and the spatial distributions of synaptic activity. Such dispersion relations, which essentially define more general phenomena as waves, are shown to restrict the spatial–temporal dynamics of synaptic action with many experimental EEG consequences. The proposed framework accounts for several salient features of spontaneous EEG and evoked potentials. We conjecture that wave-like behavior of synaptic action may facilitate interactions between remote cell assemblies, providing an important mechanism for the functional integration underlying conscious experience.
Potential of a jet-induced shock wave to influence an upstream droplet cloud in compression-ignition engines using multiple injection strategies
 High-pressure diesel-fuel sprays have been shown to emit shock wave under certain conditions, while the advanced injection strategy used in internal-combustion engines involve multiple injections taking place within a short time frame. Experimental study of double injection has shown in two instances that the first fuel-spray cloud could be accelerated before the arrival of the second fuel spray. Herein, it is hypothesized that a shock wave emitted from an injection interacts with the fuel-spray cloud of a preceding injection and is responsible of a push-away mechanism on the first droplet cloud reported on in the literature. In this context, the shock waves emitted by fuel-spray jets with a commercial 5-hole diesel injector injecting into a pressure vessel were characterized with schlieren visualizations and dynamic pressure measurements taken with single- and double-injection strategies. The experimental results confirm the shock presence based on schlieren measurements. The measured shock conditions show a different shock topology from most shock-tube experiments as the expansion wave closely followed the shock front, resulting in a thin shocked region and a short duration of the droplet exposition to the post-shock gas conditions. Experimental measurements were then used as initial conditions in a 1D multiphase simulation model allowing simulation of the shock-wave interaction with the droplet cloud under engine-related conditions. The model was used to conduct a parametric study on the droplet-cloud characteristics and showed that, as the cloud density increased, the shock intensity and droplet-induced velocity decreased. Finally, the model was used to illustrate that the push-away interaction mechanism could be explained by the shock wave–fuel-droplet-cloud interaction.
Lubricating oil conditioning sensors for online machine health monitoring – A review
 Analysis of lubricating oil is an effective approach in judging machine's health condition and providing early warning of machine's failure progression. Many studies from both academia and industry have been conducted. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art online sensors for measuring lubricant properties (e.g. wear debris, water, viscosity, aeration, soot, corrosion, and sulfur content). These online sensors include single oil property sensors based on capacitive, inductive, acoustic, and optical sensing and integrated sensors for measuring multiple oil properties. Advantages and disadvantages of each sensing method, as well as the challenges for future developments, are discussed. Research priorities are defined to address the industry needs of machine health monitoring.
Shock wave attenuation by geotextile encapsulated sand barrier systems
 This paper presents a laboratory scale experimental technique to study the performance of the encapsulated sand barrier systems in mitigating shock waves. The geotextile encapsulated sand barrier systems are made of cubical wire mesh formwork lined with geotextile and form a thick protective barrier when filled with granular materials. In the present study, dry sand particles of size varying from microns to few millimeters (fine and coarse) are used as infill granular material. Spherical shaped glass beads are also used as the infill material to study the influence of shape of the infill particle on the attenuation behavior. The process of shock wave attenuation by the sand barrier, with and without the geotextile facing formwork is examined. The experiments are performed using a conventional shock tube, where shock waves with incident Mach number in the range of 1.29–1.70 are generated. The experimental results show that the presence of geotextile layer has contributed significantly towards shock wave attenuation. The geotextile also plays an important role as a regulator, which is able to deliver gradual pressure rise at the downstream end of the barrier.
An evanescent-wave optical fiber relative humidity sensor with enhanced sensitivity
 We report a fiber optic relative humidity (RH) sensor based on the evanescent wave absorption spectroscopy using a single U-bend plastic-clad silica fiber with high dynamic range and high sensitivity. The sensor is fabricated using a CoCl2 doped thin polymer film coated on the bare fiber core. A comprehensive study of the sensor was made in terms of performance optimization. Sensor response was investigated in terms of the chemically synthesized cladding thickness over the centrally de-cladded U-bent probe. The effect of fiber core diameter on the sensitivity was also studied and the fiber with smaller core diameter was observed to be more sensitive unlike the previously reported results. In addition, we observed that the sensor was having a very fast response to the relative humidity, and was fully reversible, repeatable with a large dynamic range.
Production of a quasi-travelling wave in silicon membranes with a thin deposited layer of sol—gel PZT
 In this paper, we present the excitation of travelling waves in a rectangular silicon membrane covered with a thin sol—gel PZT layer. We first describe the process of deposition and poling of the PZT layer and the measurements of its electro-mechanical properties. Then, we have generated travelling waves in the membrane using a single-phase drive on the piezoelectric stack and we characterized the deformation modes using a special interferometer technique. Finally, we show that, by generating micron scale amplitudes of vibration, it will be possible to realise micro-actuators using this principle.
Analysis and correction of ocean wave pattern induced systematic coordinate errors in airborne LiDAR bathymetry
 This contribution investigates the effects of ocean wave patterns on 3D underwater point coordinate accuracy for LiDAR bathymetry. The refraction of the finite diameter laser pulse passing the air/water interface is modeled differentially in a strict manner. Typical wave patterns and sensor configurations are simulated, and their impact on the 3D coordinates at the bottom of the water body are systematically analyzed. It can be shown that waves have a significant effect on both the planimetry and depth coordinates of underwater topography 3D point cloud coordinates, especially for modern small footprint LiDAR systems. Planimetric effects may reach several decimeters or even meters, and depth coordinate errors also reach several decimeters, even in the case of a horizontal water body bottom. The simulations show that the simplified assumption, that wave effects average out (as is made in most LiDAR bathymetry data processing tools) is not even fulfilled for large footprint systems (spreading the laser beam to a diameter of several meters at the water surface) under certain wave pattern conditions. Modern systems with smaller beam divergence are much more sensitive to wave-induced variations of the refraction conditions and will experience significant wave pattern dependent coordinate errors. The results presented here form a basis for a more strict coordinate correction, if the wave pattern can be modeled from the LiDAR bathymetry water surface reflections or from other observations. Moreover, it will be shown that the induced coordinate errors contain a non-zero bias in addition to a local wave surface dependent quasi-random part, which allows for the formulation of wave pattern dependent correction terms in order to increase the accuracy of LiDAR bathymetry by removing systematic wave pattern dependent effects.
Gravitational wave astronomy and cosmology
 The first direct observation of gravitational waves’ action upon matter has recently been reported by the BICEP2 experiment. Advanced ground-based gravitational-wave detectors are being installed. They will soon be commissioned, and then begin searches for high-frequency gravitational waves at a sensitivity level that is widely expected to reach events involving compact objects like stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. Pulsar timing arrays continue to improve the bounds on gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies, and may detect a signal on roughly the same timescale as ground-based detectors. The science case for space-based interferometers targeting millihertz sources is very strong. The decade of gravitational-wave discovery is poised to begin. In this writeup of a talk given at the 2013 TAUP conference, we will briefly review the physics of gravitational waves and gravitational-wave detectors, and then discuss the promise of these measurements for making cosmological measurements in the near future.
Atmospheric aerosol variability above the Paris Area during the 2015 heat wave - Comparison with the 2003 and 2006 heat waves
 The aerosol layers during the heat wave of July 2015 over Paris Area have been studied using a N2-Raman lidar with co- and cross-polarized channels. The lidar observations are examined to allow the identification of main aerosol types and their origins, in synergy with measurements of the AERONET sunphotometer network and back trajectory studies from the HYSPLIT model. The results are compatible with spaceborne observations of MODIS and CALIOP. As for previous heat waves of August 2003 and July 2006 occurring in France, the aerosol optical thickness is very large, up to 0.8 at the lidar wavelength of 355 nm (between 0.5 and 0.7 at 550 nm). However, air mass trajectories highlight that the observed aerosol layers may have multiple and diverse origins during the 2015 heat wave (North America, Northwest Africa, Southern and Northern Europe). Biomass burning, pollution and desert dust aerosols have been identified, using linear particle depolarization ratio, lidar ratio and analysis of back trajectories initiated at the altitudes and arrival times of the plumes. These layers are elevated and are shown to have little impact on surface aerosol concentrations (PM10 < 40 μg m−3 or PM2.5 < 25 μg m−3) and therefore no influence on the local air quality during the 2015 heat wave, unlike in 2003 and 2006. However, they significantly modify the radiative budget by trapping part of the solar ingoing/outgoing fluxes, which leads to a mean aerosol radiative forcing close to +50 ± 17 Wm-2 per aerosol optical thickness unit at 550 nm (AOT550) for solar zenith angles between 55 and 75°, which are available from sunphotometer measurements. This value is smaller than those of the 2003 and 2006 heat waves, which are assessed to be +95 ± 13 and +70 ± 18 Wm-2/AOT550, respectively. The differences between the heat wave of 2015 and the others are mainly due to both the nature and the diversity of aerosols, as indicated by the dispersion of the single scattering albedo distributions at 550 nm: 0.90 ± 0.03, 0.95 ± 0.02 and 0.93 ± 0.04 for 2003, 2006 and 2015, respectively.
Ultrasonic guided wave tomography for ice detection
 Of great concern for many structures, particularly critical sections of rotary and fixed wing aircrafts, is the ability to detect ice either on grounded or in-flight vehicles. As a consequence, some work is reported here that could be useful for a variety of different industries where ice formation is an important problem. This paper presents experimental validations of a probability-based reconstruction algorithm (PRA) on ice detection of plate-like structures. The ice detection tests are performed for three different specimens: a single layer aluminum plate with a circular ice sensing array, a titanium plate with a sparse rectangular ice sensing array, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced titanium plate with an embedded ice sensing array mounted on a carbon fiber back plate. Cases from the simple to the more challenging exemplify that special modes can be used to differentiate ice from water, a sparse rectangular array could also be used for ice detection, and an ice sensing array could be further used to detect the ice on the sensor free side, a very useful application of ice sensing for aircraft wings, for example. Ice detection images for the respective cases are reconstructed to investigate the feasibility of ice sensing with ultrasonic guided wave tomography technology. The results show that the PRA based ultrasonic guided wave tomography method successfully detected and showed ice spots correctly for all three cases. This corroborates the fact that ultrasonic guided wave imaging technology could be a potential useful ice sensing tool in plate-like structures.
A novel method of reducing the acoustic emission wave reflected by boundary based on acoustic black hole
 Due to the difference between the characteristic impedance of air and plate structure, the acoustic emission (AE) wave propagating in a plate structure is reflected when reaching the boundary. It leads to the fact that the obtained signal contains not only direct AE components but also reflected components. The existence of the reflected AE wave brings error and difficulty to accurate AE source analysis. This paper attempts to introduce the acoustic black hole (ABH) into an experimental plate structure (a disc structure in this paper) to attenuate the reflected AE wave from the structure boundary and obtain the high Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR) direct AE wave. Firstly, the finite element model of a disc with an ABH is established to verify the attenuation of the reflected AE wave. Then, the orthogonal test is conducted to reveal the influence of geometric parameters of the ABH on reflection attenuation. And a method based on the optimal parameter combination of the ABH is proposed to attenuate boundary reflection. Finally, the broken-lead and friction experiments are performed on the processed disc with the ABH to verify the ability of the ABH to attenuate the boundary reflection of AE wave. Both analytical and experimental results show that the ABH is a candidate tool to reduce the reflected AE wave on the boundary.
Routing protocols in wireless body sensor networks: A comprehensive survey
 Wireless sensor technologies, especially Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) or Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), have gone beyond the fine-grained continuous monitoring platforms and became one of the enabling technologies that provide many successful applications in medical and non-medical fields. The physiological monitoring systems are developed to monitor the human health issues and are responsible to route the sensed data (physical or vital information for instance, blood sugar, Electromyography (EMG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electro-encephalograph (EEG), temperature, etc.) from biosensors nodes to the medical or non-medical server for further analysis. Many routing and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WBSNs. Routing protocols in WBSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. This paper present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art routing schemes in WBSN based on the recent standards and publications. First, we present the deep insight of WBSN and its related technologies. Next, distinguished characteristics of WBSN and its applications are discussed. Furthermore, routing issues and challenges are also explored as a source of inspiration towards future developments in WBANs. Based on the operational mechanism, existing routing protocols are classified as: temperature aware, QoS aware, security aware, cluster based, cross layered based and posture based routing protocols. Finally, various summary tables are provided that evaluates the efficacy of routing protocols in pursuit of design characteristics of WBSN.
Investigating of Helmholtz wave energy converter
 This study examines a new concept of wave energy conversion inspired by natural wave pools which are able to trap ocean wave energy into a basin. A novel wave energy converter that uses the Helmholtz resonance frequency is introduced. This device which is called Helmholtz wave energy converter (HWEC) amplifies the oscillation amplitude of a fluid in a basin that is connected to the sea through a narrow channel. The main focus of the current study is to understand the mechanism of wave amplification at Helmholtz resonance frequency in a basin and experimentally investigate the geometry of an ideal wave pool in a wave tank utilizing the theoretical method previously has been done on tidal Helmholtz resonance. The geometry causes amplification in oscillating fluid velocity within the channel at the Helmholtz frequency. Geometric characteristics of HWEC were experimentally studied to determine the dimensions of the basin for inducing Helmholtz resonance. A 1/25th and a 1/7th scale models were used to correlate the Helmholtz frequency with the device geometry. In addition, the effects of the device's basin length and angle of winglets at the inlet of the channel were explored. Furthermore, Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to determine the velocity fields through the channel of the 1/25th scale model. The results suggest that reducing the angle of the winglets leads to fewer higher order harmonics resulting in better performance of the device in extracting the energy of the incoming waves. It is also shown that the alignment of the axis of the device relative to the incoming waves plays an important role in the overall efficiency of the device. The results of the current study can be used to optimize the design of HWEC devices for extracting wave energy. Moreover, the results reveal that resonance in the channel results in amplification of wave height relative to incoming waves and the corresponding wave power available for absorption. Appropriate location of the power take-off (PTO) in the channel can be empirically determined using PIV data. However this work does not examine the effect of the PTO in the device's energy absorption performance.
Non-contact damage detection on a rotating blade by Lamb wave analysis
 Propeller inspection is mandatory for safe operation of aircraft. Damage evaluation on such rotating structures requires dedicated measurement techniques. In this study efforts to create a stroboscopic technique are reported. Lamb waves were excited on a rotating blade with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser synchronized to the sample rotation, whereas the wave amplitude was obtained by a laser Doppler vibrometer. A surface breaking notch on an aluminum sample rotating at 415 rpm was detected and sized with millimeter accuracy. The technique has potential for automatic non-contacting damage detection on rotating structures such as helicopter blades and turbines.
Novel experimental modelling of the hydrodynamic interactions of arrays of wave energy converters
 Wave energy converters (WECs) range significantly in respect of concepts, technologies and design maturation, with the majority of devices at an early commercial stage. To date, most large scale deployments have been conducted with a single WEC. However, there is a necessity to expand these to ‘arrays’ or ‘farms’ in the future in order to reduce both installation and maintenance cost per unit as well as harnessing maximum energy at a given site. There are complex hydrodynamic and environmental implications which require consideration when moving from a single device installation to an array of devices. Many theoretical and numerical studies exist in this domain, however, limited experimental investigations have been performed due to the cost and size related to testing facilities as well as the complexity of the experiment and related instrumentation. This paper presents a novel experimental approach, performed as part of a larger project, aiming to address a critical knowledge gap: understanding the performance of WEC arrays, and to develop a methodology to accurately model an array of WECs. The experimental investigation utilised Australia’s most technically advanced wave basin at the Australian Maritime College, specialist institute of the University of Tasmania. For the first time, it applied the phenomenological theory to experimental hydrodynamic investigation of array of generic WECs by separating the problem into its diffraction and radiation problems. Such approach removes the need of power-take-off modelling and control. Using a post-processing analytical model, the q-factor, the parameter representative of the array performance, for several configurations can be derived. Furthermore a bespoke stereo-videogrammetry method was developed to measure the wave field around and in the lee of the array. This paper describes the hydrodynamic approach and experimental methods developed as part of this project and presents preliminary results related to array q-factor and wave field measurements.
Graphene photo detector with integrated waveguide biochemical sensors
 In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a graphene integrated waveguide device with graphene as the photo detector for bio-chemical sensor applications. The working principle of the sensor is based on the variation of the local evanescent wave intensity according to the variation of the analyte's refractive index. Graphene film is transferred onto the field-effect transistor device, and an overlay of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as the waveguide. A few microliter drop of glucose is placed on the PDMS waveguide, and the change in the photocurrent through the graphene is monitored. Depending of the refractive index of the glucose (or analyte) changed, the local evanescent field changed and hence the photo current of the graphene. We believe that this sensing platform can be used for detection of various bio-analytes and for bio reactions.
Polymers and organic materials-based pH sensors for healthcare applications
 In this review, we discuss chemical, physical and electrochemical properties of pH-sensitive polymers and organic materials and their sensing mechanisms for healthcare applications. We find that polymers and organic materials, due to their biocompatibility and customizable electrical and electrochemical properties, can be used in pH sensors as structural, pH-sensitive, and passivation materials. To do so, we first identify the properties and sensing mechanisms for pH-sensitive polymers and organic materials. Different functional groups in the materials determine their chemical properties and are involved in redox reactions for chemical sensing of pH. The transport of charge carriers in the polymers and organic materials is influenced by pH-induced electrical field change, which is responsible for physical sensing of pH. Some polymers and organic materials also show hybrid sensing properties, where both functional groups and electrical field-effect contribute to their pH response. Next, we review fabrication technologies for polymers and organic materials, and identify that engineering the materials and new device structures are two possible approaches to improve the sensitivity and reliability of pH sensing devices. We propose that miniaturized sensors can provide enhanced functionality of the sensing materials in constrained spaces. Finally, we present an overview of biocompatible polymers and organic materials for monitoring of pH and pH-related analytes in biological fluids, and for pH-change-triggered drug delivery.
Bee Colony Optimization for innovative travel time estimation, based on a mesoscopic traffic assignment model
 In this article, we propose a framework for travel time prediction based on a time-discrete, mesoscopic traffic flow model, in which the measure of travel time is obtained as a link performance resulting from a dynamic network loading process. The spatiotemporal flow propagation on the road network is simulated incorporating the mesoscopic model and a linear link performance model, based on a travel time function. Acceleration levels are calculated explicitly, as a result of a fixed point problem. The traffic assignment to the network has been carried out through a completely new model, based on the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristics. In comparison with results of simulations carried out by using another mesoscopic model (DYNASMART), the travel times obtained with the proposed method appear more realistic.
Open channel flows of magnetic fluid induced by traveling magnetic field
 A theoretical analysis is made on laminar open channel flows of magnetic fluid induced by a non uniform traveling magnetic field which is applied with a stator of a single-sided linear induction motor. The induced flows are mainly in the direction opposite to the traveling direction of the magnetic field and in proportion to the phase velocity of the magnetic field. The velocity profiles are greatly affected by dimensionless wave number of the magnetic field. Near the bottom of the channel, the theoretical velocity distributions agree well with experimental ones which are measured with a laser optical fiber velocity sensor. However, the experimental velocity distributions become larger near the free surface.
Measurement of spray-cloud characteristics with bubble image velocimetry for braking wave impact
 The process of spray-cloud production and flow kinematics arising from breaking wave impact on a fixed flat-shaped plate and a bow-shaped plate models were investigated based on the image velocimetry method. During wave impact and water sheet formation on a flat surface, an enormous amount of aerated flow is created in front of the surface. This process produces a significant number of bubbles in the resulting flow. The Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV) was used to measure the wave run-up velocity. The BIV method uses these bubbles as a tracer and measures bubble velocity by correlating the texture in the bubble images. A high-speed camera was employed to record images for calculating fluid velocity. Instead of using a laser light sheet, a diffused LED backlight illuminated the bubble images. Two perpendicular plane views were used to capture the footages: a side and a front view. The wave run-up velocity measurements at the moment of impact are compared with the results of several published experimental results. Aside from the BIV method, spray characteristics were examined based on the Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) method. This method was used for the area that the concentration of bubbles is low or no bubbles are present. Measurements of droplet size, and velocity, as well as wave run-up velocity, were major concerns in this study. Results of velocimetry from both views were compared, and a satisfactory agreement was achieved among > 90% of the data. The highly transient process of spray formation from the liquid sheet breakup was discussed, and the drag coefficients and drag forces were calculated in two different stages of spray formation. Several pressure sensors were used to measure the impact pressure and three capacitive wave probes to measure the free surface profile. It was observed that higher impact pressure leads to the production of more dense and finer spray with a higher transition velocity. Moreover, it was illustrated that smaller size droplets have a higher velocity in compare with the medium and large size droplets, however, because of the effect of drag force these small size droplets cannot reach the maximum spray heights.
PolyWaTT: A polynomial water travel time estimator based on Derivative Dynamic Time Warping and Perceptually Important Points
 Traditional methods for estimating timing parameters in hydrological science require a rigorous study of the relations of flow resistance, slope, flow regime, watershed size, water velocity, and other local variables. These studies are mostly based on empirical observations, where the timing parameter is estimated using empirically derived formulas. The application of these studies to other locations is not always direct. The locations in which equations are used should have comparable characteristics to the locations from which such equations have been derived. To overcome this barrier, in this work, we developed a data-driven approach to estimate timing parameters such as travel time. Our proposal estimates timing parameters using historical data of the location without the need of adapting or using empirical formulas from other locations. The proposal only uses one variable measured at two different locations on the same river (for instance, two river-level measurements, one upstream and the other downstream on the same river). The recorded data from each location generates two time series. Our method aligns these two time series using derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and perceptually important points (PIP). Using data from timing parameters, a polynomial function generalizes the data by inducing a polynomial water travel time estimator, called PolyWaTT. To evaluate the potential of our proposal, we applied PolyWaTT to three different watersheds: a floodplain ecosystem located in the part of Brazil known as Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area; and the Missouri River and the Pearl River, in United States of America. We compared our proposal with empirical formulas and a data-driven state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyWaTT showed a lower mean absolute error than all other methods tested in this study, and for longer distances the mean absolute error achieved by PolyWaTT is three times smaller than empirical formulas.
Determination of microseismic event azimuth from S-wave splitting analysis
 P-wave hodogram analysis has been the only reliable method to obtain microseismic event azimuths for one-well monitoring. However, microseismic data usually have weak or even no P-waves due to near double-couple focal mechanisms and limited ray path coverage, which causes large uncertainties in determined azimuths and event locations. To solve this problem, we take advantage of S-waves, which are often much stronger than P waves in microseismic data, and determine event azimuths by analyzing S-wave splitting data. This approach utilizes the positive correlation between the accuracy of event azimuth and the effectiveness of measuring S-wave splitting parameters and finds the optimal azimuth through a grid search. We have demonstrated that event azimuths can be well constrained from S-wave splitting analysis using both synthetic and field microseismic data. This method is less sensitive to noise than the routine P-wave hodogram method and provides a new way of determining microseismic event azimuths.
A retrievable sensor installation technique for acquiring high frequency signals
 The use of in-seam waves for void detection in mines requires the capability of capturing high frequency signals over large distances. For instance, the Airy phase of Love waves which are used for void detection in coal mines ranges from several hundred to over one thousand Hertz and the expected travel distance of these signals is at least 90 m (equivalent to a detection distance of 45 m) for the technique to be considered practical. In order to obtain high quality and broadband signals, sensors are conventionally grouted at the bottom of boreholes so that the attenuation due to the fractured surface is minimized and the coupling effect is improved. However, to be economically feasible, the expensive and high sensitive sensors must be retrievable so that they can be used repeatedly at the same or other locations. Because of these concerns, a retrievable sensor installation technique was developed. This paper provides a detailed review of the technique as well as a brief discussion of its applications. The technique is simple and reliable for both installation and retrieval operations and can be used for boreholes oriented in any directions. The technique has been demonstrated in over 200 sensor installation/retrieval operations under various borehole conditions, including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, shale, sandstone and trona. With this technique, we were able to detect the high frequency signals required for our projects. For instance, the signals used at a trona mine for void detection have a typical frequency of 5 kHz with the travel distance of 150–200 m. The results of these operations have shown that sensors installed in the prescribed manner exhibit predictable, consistent, and repeatable performance. The technique also provides an economical and reliable means for many other field seismic monitoring applications where high quality and broadband signals are essential, such as microseismic monitoring and geotomography studies.
Data gathering problem with the data importance consideration in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks
 In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), if sensors rely on multi-hop transmission to send sensing data to the sink above the water, sensors that are closer to the water's surface will deplete energy sooner because they share a larger load of the packet relaying work. This problem becomes worse if the water being monitored is very deep. This imbalance in energy consumption can be effectively mitigated by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data. However, if the data to collect are important, the delay time required by this data gathering method may be too long. In this study, we integrate the two data gathering mechanisms mentioned above, namely utilization of AUVs and multi-hop transmission, to reduce the problem of unbalanced energy consumption and long delay time. Moreover, we also investigate how to determine the importance level of data and set delay time requirements without domain knowledge. Our purpose is to deliver data of higher importance to the sink within the delay time requirement. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance in energy consumption, reduce the delay time required for delivering important data, and also prolong the network lifetime.
Boussinesq modeling of solitary wave run-up reduction by emergent vegetation on a sloping beach
 To better understand the reduction of the run-up of leading tsunami waves by mangrove forests on a sloping beach, we presented a numerical model in this study, which was based on one-dimensional (1D) fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations with the effect of vegetation resistance included in terms of the drag coefficient. Solitary waves were used to model the leading tsunami waves and five models of different forest densities and tree distributions of the emergent vegetation were examined. The bottom friction and vegetation drag were calibrated based on our published laboratory experiments. Model results show that the modified Boussinesq equations could give satisfactory predictions of the solitary wave transformation over the vegetation and subsequent run-up on the slope. The drag coefficient was found to be dependent on the incident wave height. Effects of beach slope, forest density and tree distribution on the drag coefficient were also discussed based on the numerical results.
Fiber-Optic Underground Sensor Networks
 The main motives driving the trend toward increased implementation of structural monitoring systems are the need for structural health monitoring of existing and ageing structures and the desire for a better understanding of increasingly complex designs through performance monitoring of new structures. This drive is sustained by rapid progress in research and technology development on sensors and communications. This chapter presents three case studies focusing on the monitoring of tunnels using distributed fiber-optic sensing. The first case study presents the results of strain development in the sprayed concrete lining (SCL) of a new Crossrail station tunnel during excavation of a cross-passage. The second case study focuses on the short term monitoring of a century old cast iron tunnel during the proximity construction of a large platform tunnel for the Crossrail project. The final case study describes the early stage implementation of a long-term structural health monitoring program to assess the integrity of tunnels at CERN. For all these projects Brillouin-based time domain techniques were used. A brief description of the basic principles of the method and the fiber-optic systems used is presented before the case studies. The variety of optical fibers available today combined with the number of fibre devices, with improved characteristics, recently developed provides a countless potential sensor configurations for environmental monitoring. In this chapter, a background of the use of fiber optic sensor networks in environmental applications are discussed focus in the optical detection for gas leakage sensing, water contamination sensing, soil contamination sensing and mapping with distributed fiber-optic sensors for environment.

Opto-electronic humidity sensor: A review
 The present paper reports the detailed study of various metal oxide nanomaterials as opto-electronic humidity sensor. The sensor elements were fabricated and characterized as thin or thick film based on the semi-conducting metal oxide. As semi-conducting metal oxides are known for their n-type conduction because of the presence of oxygen vacancies and change in refractive indices with the exposure of moisture therefore they were proven to be very good sensors for humidity. Depending upon the need, the sensing materials were deposited either on the base of the prism or on the U-shaped borosilicate glass rods or on some other transparent substrates for opto-electronic sensing. Light from LED or He–Ne laser was launched into the sensing element from one side and collected into the other side by optical power meter. The mode of propagation of light was transmission, reflection or partially refraction. Modulations in the intensity of light with changes in humidity were recorded. Being optical in nature, such types of sensors are very useful for detection of moisture level at remote places or unmanned stations. The primary purpose of this paper is to focus on the techniques used in these sensors.
Numerical modeling for karst cavity sonar detection beneath bored cast in situ pile using 3D staggered grid finite difference method
 Karst cavities beneath bored cast in situ piles constitute substantial dangers to the stability and quality of underground construction projects. Therefore, it is important to detect and image these karst cavities before the construction of piles for such projects. New sonar detection methods, which have advantages such as low cost and high efficiency, can ensure the quality of the bedrock for underground construction projects. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hole-bedrock-cave model for the sonar detection of karst cavities was developed using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The modeling parameters were calibrated with measured data, and the numerical results were then compared with measured field detection data to validate the reliability of the proposed method. The numerical results revealed the following findings. (1) The waves transmitted to the center of the pile hole bottom can be divided into three types: the waves traveling upward into the slurry that are absorbed by a perfectly matched layer (PML) and can be ignored, the waves traveling horizontally along the hole bottom that constitute the primary interference during the detection process, and the waves traveling downward into the bedrock that represent the effective detection signal. To minimize the negative effects of multiple reflections from the pile hole wall, we deployed a receiver at the midpoint between the transmission point and the hole wall, at which location the signals from the multiple reflections are symmetrical and easy to identify. (2) The reflected signals generated from different depths, sizes and directions of cavities have different travel time features that make it possible to estimate the depth, size and direction of a cavity beneath a pile. (3) The velocities of multiple surface wave reflections can be predicted in the frequency spectrum of a test signal and then used to predict the arrival times of multiple surface wave reflections and identify reflected P-waves. (4) Cavities have a focusing effect on waves when they are completely filled with a low-velocity medium. The energy of a wave reflected from the floor of a karst cavity after focusing is theoretically stronger than that reflected from the roof of a karst cavity. (5) PMLs can effectively absorb waves reflected from artificial boundaries to avoid false interference. High-order FDTD methods can eliminate numerical dispersion and reduce the computational costs. In general, the sonar detection of karst cavities beneath bored piles can be simulated using a 3D high-order staggered grid finite difference method and PMLs. This numerical modeling scheme is reliable and can improve the accuracy and feasibility of practical detection experiments.
Effect of observed micropolar motions on wave propagation in deep Earth minerals
 We provide a method to compute the Cosserat couple modulus for a bridgmanite (MgSiO3 silicate perovskite) solid from frequency gaps observed in Raman experiments. To this aim, we apply micropolar theory which is a generalization of the classical linear elastic theory, where each particle has an intrinsic rotational degree of freedom, called micro-rotation and/or spin, and which depends on the so-called Cosserat couple modulus μc that characterizes the micropolar medium. We investigate both wave propagation and dispersion. The wave propagation simulations in both potassium nitrate (KNO3) and bridgmanite crystal leads to a faster elastic wave propagation as well as to an independent rotational field of motion, called optic mode, which is smaller in amplitude compared to the conventional rotational field. The dispersion analysis predicts that the optic mode only appears above a cutoff frequency, ωr, which has been observed in Raman experiments done at high pressures and temperatures on bridgmanite crystal. The comparison of the cutoff frequency observed in experiments and the micropolar theory enables us to compute for the first time the temperature and pressure dependency of the Cosserat couple modulus μc of bridgmanite. This study thus shows that the micropolar theory can explain particle motions observed in laboratory experiments that were before neglected and that can now be used to constrain the micropolar elastic constants of Earth’s mantle like material. This pioneer work aims at encouraging the use of micropolar theory in future works on deep Earth’s mantle material by providing Cosserat couple modulus that were not available before.
Importance of infragravity waves for the generation of washover deposits
 Washover deposits are among the most remarkable sedimentary signatures of dune breaching and coastal inundation. Overwash of the barrier leading to washover development can be related either to storms or tsunamis but the distinction between these two processes based on the depositional record is still a matter of debate. Hence, studying recent well-documented washover deposits, combining sedimentological and hydrodynamic investigations is a key approach to identify the processes governing the washover deposition and to analyze their sediment record within the washover. During the winter of 2013–2014, the coasts of the Bay of Biscay experienced an exceptional wave climate, leading to dune breaching and washover deposition at many locations, including the Gatseau Spit (South of Oléron Island, France). Field observations, aerial photographs, topographic measurements, GPR investigations, trenches and cores, grain size analysis and magnetic fabric measurements were carried out and complemented with hydrodynamic modeling of tides, storm surges, short waves and infra gravity waves in order to compute maximum runup during the winter of 2013–2014. Such an interdisciplinary approach led to propose that: (1) large overwash events occurring during the winter of 2013–2014 were mainly driven by infra gravity (IG) waves combined with high tides; (2) the washover elongated outer shape was strongly controlled by the antecedent morphology of the back-barrier area; (3) one overwash flow driven by one IG wave is recorded by one normally graded lamina composed of quartz sand at base and heavy minerals enriched sand at top; (4) dominant settling of the particles from a suspension during sedimentation occurred in the end of each overwash flow in response to flow velocity decrease; (5) laminae can be grouped in laminasets generally composed of thinning upward laminae, related to overwash flow depth decrease during falling tide and to erosion of basal laminae by highest overwash flows occurring more likely around the high tide; (6) the number of laminasets in a proximal position is in the same order of magnitude as the number of modeled highest runup events, offering an almost complete record of overwash events that occurred during the winter 2013–2014.
Field observation of wave damping by fluid mud
 Extensive mud deposits are found off Cassino Beach, Brazil. The wave damping over the muddy bottom was studied using field measurements. By applying a technique of spectral analysis we showed that the wave attenuation occurred differently throughout the wave spectra. Field measurements revealed that the maximum wave energy dissipation took place over the deposit's depocenter and that lutocline height varied significantly in the order of days. The results indicated that short waves (from 3.75 to 6.25 s) underwent the greatest damping due to the interaction with fluid mud. An idealized 1-D model helped to explain the observations.
Observations of shear-wave splitting parameters in the Western Gulf of Corinth focusing on the 2014 Mw = 5.0 earthquake
 The Western Gulf of Corinth, located in Central Greece, is an active neotectonic graben that features intense seismicity. Events recorded by dense local networks during 2014 (including those belonging to an offshore swarm between Nafpaktos and Psathopyrgos) were used to perform a shear-wave splitting study, with recordings that fulfill strict criteria. The splitting parameters, determined by visually inspecting polarigrams and hodograms, are the polarization direction of the fast shear-wave and the time-delay between the two-split shear-waves. Over 960 observations were obtained for 13 stations in the area. Temporal variations of normalized time-delays were investigated to extract patterns that indicate stress accumulation and release. Such patterns were identified in 5 stations, where linear trends of increase, followed by a decrease a couple of weeks before the Mw = 5.0 7th November 2014 earthquake, were identified. These observations highlight similarities with behavior of time-delays before the occurrence of earthquakes in other areas. Nevertheless, scattering of measurements poses a significant challenge in interpreting these variations. The mean polarization direction of the fast shear-wave in each station is consistent with the known regional maximum horizontal stress component (i.e. WNW–ESE), except for three stations located in the northern shore of the gulf, which present a general NE–SW polarization direction. The former is interpreted with the Anisotropic Poro-Elasticity model, where fluids within microcracks, aligned with the regional stress regime, affect shear-wave splitting. The latter are located in an area where faults of similar direction have been mapped, which could indicate the presence of secondary local stress states.
Effects of composite lamina properties on fundamental Lamb wave mode dispersion characteristics
 Lamb waves are useful for detecting changes in material properties, as their propagation characteristics are sensitive to changes in the medium through which they travel. Defects and damage in materials/structures can be detected by analyzing the difference between the phase and/or group velocity amplitude and mode changes of Lamb waves’ propagation in damaged versus un-damaged specimens. The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves are described in the form of dispersion curves, relating phase and/or group velocities to the product of frequency and thickness, with these curves being generated by solving the Lamb wave equations. In this article, the effect on the Lamb wave propagation/dispersion due to changes in the material properties such as E11, E22, G12, and density were analyzed for three different composite laminate types – unidirectional, cross-ply, and quasi-isotropic, all constructed out of 16-plies of unidirectional carbon-fiber epoxy prepregs. The analysis was performed by obtaining the characteristic Lamb waves’ phase velocity dispersion and slowness curves for each laminate type. This was done by reducing E11, E22, and G12 by 5%, 10%, 15% and 30%, and density by 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% with the intent of representing manufacturing and in-service defects. Since the Lamb waves’ velocity in a composite laminate varies with the propagation direction, the laminates were analyzed at 0°, 20°, 45°, 70°, and 90° propagation angles, with all the aforementioned variations. A program developed in MATLAB was used to generate the dispersion curves for the fundamental anti-symmetric and symmetric Lamb wave. The information provided in this paper can be used to select the proper Lamb wave modes, excitation frequency, which in turn governs sensor selection, data acquisition hardware, and damage detection algorithm for structural health monitoring of composite structures.
Experimental validation of the ISWEC wave to PTO model
 Wave power represents a highly promising field in the broader area of green energy and it is currently the subject of increasing research and investments. The wave energy converter (WEC) under study in this paper is a 1:8 scaled prototype of the ISWEC, a device able to harvest sea energy exploiting the inertial effect of a gyroscope. The aim of this work is to validate the numerical simulation model of the device against the results of a wave tank test campaign carried out in INSEAN facilities in Rome. In the first part of the paper the ISWEC dynamic and hydrodynamic governing laws are outlined and implemented in a numerical model. A detailed description of the 1:8 scaled prototype characteristics is provided together with the experimental setup for the tank tests. A wide range of theoretical operating conditions are considered in order to test the system dynamics as well as its control strategy, and it is discussed how different control strategies influence the system behavior and its energy production. In the last part the experimental results are compared with the output of the numerical model, which gives a good prediction of the device behavior.
Photonic millimeter-wave bridge for multi-Gbps passive optical networks
 Survivability is a critical requirement of optical communication networks that is typically addressed implementing path diversity. However, due to the elevated cost of fiber installation, this approach may prove prohibitively expensive in optical access networks. In this paper, a novel cost-efficient photonic millimeter (mm)-wave bridge is proposed, which converts passive optical network (PON) signals to radiofrequency signals at mm-wave bands. The performance of the mm-wave photonic bridge is numerically tested, revealing its feasibility to transmit a 2.5-Gbps PON with –55.6 dB wireless link gain (WLG) using the 81–86 GHz band and 10-Gbps PON with –35 dB at the 102–109.5 GHz band. The effect of fiber is also analyzed, showing that fiber cuts closer to the optical network unit degrades more the system performance.
Measurement issues associated with surface mounting of thermopile heat flux sensors
 Thermopile is one of the most commonly used heat flux sensor, usually attached to the surface of interest for measurement of wall heat flux. One of the major drawbacks of such surface mounted sensors is that they potentially disturb the very thermo-physical phenomena responsible for heat transfer, altering the heat transport through the medium on which it is mounted, resulting in erroneous measurements. This paper closely examines the intrusion due to surface mounting of such sensors. Parametric simulations have been performed for commonly employed sensor mounting configurations. Furthermore, the attenuation in heat transfer through the plate as a function of its thermophysical properties (absolute as well as relative to the sensor material) is evaluated. It is found that matching the impedance of sensor and heat conduction medium is important for minimizing the intrusive effects. Simulations are substantiated by a case-study involving heat flux measurement during filmwise condensation of steam on a flat plate in the presence of air. The experimental design ratifies the recommendations of the simulation study, minimizing the intrusive effects after proper impedance matching and in situ calibration. The resulting heat transfer coefficient estimated using the measured wall heat flux matches well with those obtained using Terasaka-Makita correlation.
Elastic wave characterization of controlled low-strength material using embedded piezoelectric transducers
 Ultrasonic wave methods have been widely used to monitor the hydration process of cementitious materials. However, the conventional ultrasonic wave methods require a coupling agent and pressure or a buffer material to maximize the coupling of the transducer. The objective of this study is to apply two types of embedded piezoelectric transducers to controlled low-strength material (CLSM) and to monitor the elastic wave characteristics during the hydration process. The CLSM mixture is composed of silica sand, calcium sulfoaluminate cement, fly ash, and water, and then, the CLSM mixture is prepared with three different fine contents. Using piezoelectric disk and bender elements installed in cuboid containers, the compressional and shear waves are measured for 72 h at various intervals. The monitoring results show that during the hydration process, the evolution of shear wave velocities obtained using the bender element is less variable than that in compressional wave velocities obtained using the piezoelectric disk element. As a power function, the shear wave velocities increase with an increase in the elapsed time. As the fine content of the CLSM mixture increases, the water content required for the flowability of the CLSM mixture increases and the shear wave velocities then decrease. The results demonstrate that the CLSM mixture with high water content induces a delay of the interconnection of the cementitious particles at the very early stage of the hydration. The geometric boundary condition of the container is considered as an aspect of the estimation of the shear wave velocity obtained by the bender element. This study demonstrates that the embedded elastic wave transducers can be effectively used for monitoring the hydration process of CLSMs.
A self-calibration water level measurement using an interdigital capacitive sensor
 A water level measurement using an interdigital capacitive sensor with low-cost, low-energy, good repeatability, high linearity, and ease of installation is proposed with a support of experimental results. This sensor comprises a printed circuit board (PCB) with configuration of two interpenetrating comb electrodes. The comb electrode is 70–80 mm width, 300 mm height with 1–2 mm spacing between each comb. This configuration of electrode causes the capacitance between comb electrodes to vary by the water level. Microcontroller is used to calculate the capacitance between comb electrodes in terms of a discharge time correlated to the water level. A practical water level measurement technique using two comb electrodes designated as level and reference sensors is presented. This technique can directly be applied to water with different conditions without recalibration. This sensor is able to measure absolute levels of water with 0.2 cm resolution over 30 cm range. In addition, it is also sensitive enough to trace the variability of water level. A flood monitoring simulation is carried out in wave flume where this sensor is used to detect the rising wave.
Experimental study on overtopping performance of a circular ramp wave energy converter
 Circular ramp overtopping wave energy converter (CROWN) is an offshore overtopping wave energy converter that consists of a reservoir surrounded by a circular ramp and an outflow duct installed with a low water head turbine. Physical model experiments were conducted in a wave tank as a preliminary study at Ocean University of China. The wave overtopping behaviors demonstrated that guide vanes can effectively lead the wave water motion on the ramp for overtopping into the reservoir. An analysis of the overtopping discharge shows that the resonant zone is located in the smaller relative wave length domain. Within the scope of shape parameters used in this study, guide vanes and milder ramp slopes were found to significantly enhance the overtopping discharge. The orientation of the guide vane angle also had a large influence on the overtopping flow rates for smaller relative wave heights and lengths. The experimental results are presented with the aim of designing and optimizing the shape parameters of CROWN for a future prototype device.
Lamb wave mode decomposition for structural health monitoring
 Lamb waves propagate over large distances in plate-like thin structures and they have received great attention in the structural health monitoring (SHM) field as an efficient means to inspect a large area of a structure by using only a small number of sensors. The times-of-flight of the Lamb wave modes are useful for detecting damage generated in a structure. However, due to the dispersive and multi-mode nature of Lamb waves, it is very challenging to decompose Lamb wave modes into symmetric and anti-symmetric modes for potential applications to structural health monitoring. Thus, we propose an efficient Lamb wave mode decomposition method based on two fundamental rules: the group velocity ratio rule and the mode amplitude ratio rule. The group velocity ratio rule means that the ratio of the group velocities of A0 and S0 modes must be constant. The mode amplitude ratio rule means that the ratio of the magnitudes of A0 and S0 modes in a measured response signal must be always greater than one once the center frequency of the input signal is determined, such that the magnitude of the A0 mode in the excited signal is larger than that of the S0 mode, and vice versa. The proposed method is verified through experiments conducted for a plate specimen.
Two-dimensional Morlet wavelet transform and its application to wave recognition methodology of automatically extracting two-dimensional wave packets from lidar observations in Antarctica
 Waves in the atmosphere and ocean are inherently intermittent, with amplitudes, frequencies, or wavelengths varying in time and space. Most waves exhibit wave packet-like properties, propagate at oblique angles, and are often observed in two-dimensional (2-D) datasets. These features make the wavelet transforms, especially the 2-D wavelet approach, more appealing than the traditional windowed Fourier analysis, because the former allows adaptive time-frequency window width (i.e., automatically narrowing window size at high frequencies and widening at low frequencies), while the latter uses a fixed envelope function. This study establishes the mathematical formalism of modified 1-D and 2-D Morlet wavelet transforms, ensuring that the power of the wavelet transform in the frequency/wavenumber domain is equivalent to the mean power of its counterpart in the time/space domain. Consequently, the modified wavelet transforms eliminate the bias against high-frequency/small-scale waves in the conventional wavelet methods and many existing codes. Based on the modified 2-D Morlet wavelet transform, we put forward a wave recognition methodology that automatically identifies and extracts 2-D quasi-monochromatic wave packets and then derives their wave properties including wave periods, wavelengths, phase speeds, and time/space spans. A step-by-step demonstration of this methodology is given on analyzing the lidar data taken during 28–30 June 2014 at McMurdo, Antarctica. The newly developed wave recognition methodology is then applied to two more lidar observations in May and July 2014, to analyze the recently discovered persistent gravity waves in Antarctica. The decomposed inertia-gravity wave characteristics are consistent with the conclusion in Chen et al. (2016a) that the 3–10 h waves are persistent and dominant, and exhibit lifetimes of multiple days. They have vertical wavelengths of 20–30 km, vertical phase speeds of 0.5–2 m/s, and horizontal wavelengths up to several thousands kilometers in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The variations in the extracted wave properties from different months in winter indicate a month-to-month variability in the gravity wave activities in the Antarctic MLT region.
Effects of longitudinal wave on the resonance behavior of an electrode-separated piezoelectric sensor in liquids
 An electrode-separated piezoelectric sensor (ESPS) was constructed and its operation in the liquid phase was characterized. When the surface of the separated-electrode reflects the weak longitudinal wave (LW) back to the surface of the quartz disc where it was generated, the interaction of the reflected LW with the main thickness-shear wave of the quartz disc is a potential error source. In this study, the influence of the LW effect on the response of the ESPS was investigated by an impedance analysis method. It was shown that all the impedance response parameters shift periodically as a function of the distance between the separated-electrode and the quartz crystal. The LW effect depends markedly on the surface conditions, including the shape, area, position, angle and roughness, of the separated-electrode. When a rough, non-parallel or ball electrode was used, the influence of the LW could be decreased greatly. The influence of the air/liquid interface on the reflection of the LW was efficiently screened in the ESPS.
Acoustic sensors
 The chapter opens with an overview of acoustic parameters and properties. Next the operation and performance of piezoelectric and electrostatic transducers are discussed. In the ensuing section various methods for distance measurements are given, generally based on the ToF principle. Finally, in the application section, we discuss examples of ranging and imaging, as well as nondestructive testing, inspection using acoustic principles and interfacing.
The sensing principle of a new type of crack sensor based on linear macro-bending loss of an optical fiber and its experimental investigation
 For traditional distributed optical fiber sensors, the sensing principle is based on a complex relationship between the crack opening displacement (COD) and the macro-bending loss of the fiber, which introduces many difficulties in its application in practical engineering projects. To solve this problem, a simple linear relationship between the macro-bending loss of the fiber and the COD is established in this work by controlling the fiber winding shaft to ensure the bending radius remains constant. Based on this linear relationship, a crack sensing principle of optical fiber is proposed. To verify the feasibility of this crack sensing principle, a validation experiment was performed using three groups of fiber winding shafts with different diameters and three groups of working light sources with different wavelengths. The experimental results show that the macro-bending loss is linearly related to the COD. Based on the proposed crack sensing principle, and a new type of optical fiber crack sensor to monitor the COD of pre-existing cracks and contraction joints of structures is designed, and the performance is verified by an experiment.
Three-dimensional modeling of the wave dynamics of tensegrity lattices
 This paper develops effective numerical models to study the wave dynamics of highly nonlinear tensegrity metamaterials. Recent studies have highlighted the geometrically nonlinear response of structural lattices based on tensegrity prisms, which may gradually change their elastic response from stiffening to softening through the modification of mechanical, geometrical, and prestress variables. We here study the nonlinear dynamics of columns of tensegrity prisms subject to impulsive compressive loading. An effective nonlinear rigid body dynamics is employed to simulate the dynamic response of such metamaterials. We illustrate how to pass from the matrix to the vector form of the equations of motions, on accounting for a rigid response of the compressive members (bars). Numerical simulations show that the wave dynamics of the examined metamaterials supports compression solitary pulses with profile dependent on the elastic properties of the tensile members (strings), the given impact velocity, and the applied prestress. We conclude that tensegrity columns can be effectively used as tunable acoustic lenses, which are able to generate acoustic solitary waves with adjustable profile in a host medium.
A combined dielectrophoresis, traveling wave dielectrophoresis and electrorotation microchip for the manipulation and characterization of human malignant cells
 The study of the dielectric properties of micrometer- or nanometer-scale particles is of particular interest in present-day applications of biomedical engineering. Electrokinetics utilises electrically energised microelectrode structures within microfluidic chambers to noninvasively probe the physiological structure of live cancer cells. A system is described that combines the three complementary techniques of dielectrophoresis (DEP), travelling wave dielectrophoresis (TWD) and electrorotation (ROT) for the first time on a single, integrated chip (3×6 mm). The chip employs planar microelectrode arrays fabricated on a silicon substrate to facilitate the synthesis of the various nonuniform electric fields required for the controlled manipulation, measurement and characterization of mammalian cells. A study of the dielectric properties of human malignant cells (Daudi and NCI-H929) was performed to demonstrate the potential and the versatility of the system in providing a fully programmable microsystem.
Defect detection and location in switch rails by acoustic emission and Lamb wave analysis: A feasibility study
 An acoustic emission (AE) based approach is proposed in this study to identify and locate newly initiated defects or the propagation of existing defects in railroad switch rails. Defect-induced AE signals are identified through frequency analysis, as frequencies of these signals are much higher than those induced by structural vibration. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is employed to analyze the Lamb wave dispersion of the detected signal, so that two characteristic points can be selected on the CWT contour map to locate the defect. Using this approach, defects in a damaged switch rail can be located using a single sensor.
Derivation and experimental validation of Lamb wave equations for an n-layered anisotropic composite laminate
 Lamb waves are ultrasonic guided waves that propagate between two parallel free surfaces and their use for damage detection has been widely explored and demonstrated. Damage in materials/structures can be detected by analyzing the difference between the phase/group velocity and the loss of amplitude of Lamb waves on damaged and un-damaged specimens. The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves are described in the form of dispersion curves, which are plots of phase/group velocities versus the product of frequency-thickness generated by solving the Lamb wave equations. Lamb waves’ dispersion behaviors for isotropic materials are well established in the literature; however, such is not the case for the laminated composites. The most common methods for solving the Lamb wave equations in composites consist of using laminated plate theory or 3D linear elasticity by assuming an orthotropic and/or higher symmetry. This assumption may not be true, if the actuators and sensors in an orthotropic or transversely isotropic laminates are installed in a non-principle direction or the layup is symmetric but not balanced. This paper presents a full derivation of Lamb wave equations for n-layered monoclinic composite laminates based on linear 3D elasticity by considering the displacement fields in all three directions using the partial wave technique in combination with the Global Matrix (GM) approach. In the partial wave technique, the principle of superposition of three upward and three downward travelling plane waves are assumed in order to satisfy the associated boundary conditions. The bounded upper and lower surfaces reflect the waves and the combination of these reflections going towards the upper or lower interfaces results in the propagating guided waves. The GM approach is used to assemble all the equations from each layer to form a global, unified matrix that describes the displacement and stress fields along the entire laminate associated with the wave propagation. A robust method for numerically solving the Lamb wave equations is also presented. The presented method was verified experimentally by analyzing the propagation of Lamb waves in two different composite panels constructed out of unidirectional carbon-fiber epoxy prepreg and fiber-metal laminate (GLARE 3-3/4). The panels were instrumented with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric sensors, which were excited at different frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to 500 kHz to generate and acquire the waves. The waves were excited and gathered at three different propagation angles of 0°, 45°, and 90° for the carbon-fiber epoxy laminate panel and at six different angles of 0°, 20°, 45°, 70° and 90° for the fiber-metal laminates (GLARE). The phase and group velocities of the fundamental symmetric (So) and anti-symmetric (Ao) Lamb waves were extracted by tracking the peaks of each individual wave phase and the wave envelope respectively using an in-house code developed in MATLAB. It was found that the presented 3D linear elasticity model followed the experimental data closely for both symmetric and anti-symmetric Lamb modes. The analytical method presented in this paper was able to predict the Lamb wave dispersion for both the carbon-fiber epoxy laminate and the hybrid fiber-metal laminate proving the robustness and versatility of the solution method.
Significance of Sensor Location in Real-time Traffic State Estimation
 Short-term congestion caused due to traffic incidents or other road environment factors significantly reduces traffic flow capacity of a link which forms a major part of travel time delays. Accurate and reliable estimate of real-time traffic state is essential for optimizing network performance during unpredictable events. Inaccurate estimate of current traffic state produces unreliable travel-time estimations which lead to ineffective traffic management strategies during traffic incident. This study highlights the accuracy and reliability of traffic state estimate when a traffic flow prediction model is not provided with information about duration and impact of the incident on traffic flow capacity of the link. Cell Transmission Model (CTM) is used for prediction of traffic state and measurements from the sensor are combined in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to minimize square of error between predicted and measured traffic state. A simple link is used to highlight the difference between actual traffic state and estimated traffic state using a naive prediction model for real-time traffic state estimation. Analysis of simulation results shows that estimate of traffic state is reliable and accurate for cells upstream of the measurement sensor when incident occurred downstream of measurement sensor. Whereas when incident location is upstream of measurement sensor, the estimated traffic state for downstream cells of measurement sensor is more close to actual traffic condition.
Mach–Zehnder interferometer sensor based on the U-shaped probe for concentration sensing
 A newly compact bent tapered optical fibre sensor is proposed and demonstrated for the detection of levofloxacin concentration. The structure of micro fibre Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MMZI) is fabricated using a glass processing system, demonstrating a 30 mm-long single mode fibre between two tapered fibres which has a waist diameter of 15 μm and tapering length of 6 mm. A combination of bending and tapering acts as a sensor, which results in high penetration depth of evanescent field. The sensor is sensitive to concentration variation. Upon exposure to Levofloxacin concentrations varying from 50 to 250 ppm, the U-shaped MMZI sensor sensitivity is 21 pm/ppm and a linearity of more than 98.7%, which is about 1.49 fold greater than that of a straight MMZI sensor. In addition, the U-shaped MMZI sensor is very compact in size which make this type of fibre sensor is easily measuring concentration variation in small volume.
Wave reflection and transmission in rotating and stressed pyroelectric half-planes
 This paper describes the rotation and initial stress effects on the wave reflection and transmission between two pyroelectric half-planes using inhomogeneous wave approach. The rotation in the governing pyroelectric equation is characterized by considering the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations and the initial stresses are considered by modifying the elasticity tensor. A scenario is modeled where a quasi-transverse wave is incident on interface, resulting into reflected and transmitted waves like temperature wave, quasi-transverse wave, quasi-longitudianal wave, and surface wave in both half-planes. Rotation and initial stresses’ effects on the wave velocity, attenuation, and energy coefficients are presented.
Simultaneous estimation of states and parameters in Newell’s simplified kinematic wave model with Eulerian and Lagrangian traffic data
 The traffic state estimation process estimates various traffic states from available data in a road network and provides valuable information for travelers and decision makers to improve both travel experience and system performance. In many existing methods, model parameters and initial states have to be given in order to estimate traffic states, which limits the accuracy of the results as well as their transferability to different locations and times. In this paper, we propose a new framework to simultaneously estimate model parameters and traffic states for a congested road segment based on Newell’s simplified kinematic wave model (Newell, 1993). Given both Eulerian traffic count data and Lagrangian vehicle reidentification data, we formulate a single optimization problem in terms of the initial number of vehicles and model parameters. Then we decouple the optimization problem such that the initial number of vehicles can be analytically solved with a closed-form formula, and the model parameters, including the jam density and the shock wave speed in congested traffic, can be computed with the Gauss-Newton method. Based on Newell’s model, we can calculate individual vehicles’ trajectories as well as the average densities, speeds, and flow-rates inside the road segment. We also theoretically show that the optimization problem can have multiple solutions under absolutely steady traffic conditions. We apply the proposed method to the NGSIM datasets, verifying the validity of the method and showing that this method yields better results in the estimation of average densities than existing methods.

Application of an ultra-wide band sensor-free wireless network for ground monitoring
 Ground displacement monitoring is one of the most important aspects of early warning systems and risk management strategies when addressing phenomena such as landslides or subsidence. Several types of instrumentation already exist, but those able to provide real-time warnings on multiple time series are typically based on expensive technology, highlighting the need to develop a low-cost, easy to install system suitable for emergency monitoring. Therefore, a wireless network based on ultra-wideband impulse radiofrequency technology has been realized. The novelty of this network consists of its ability to measure the distance between nodes using the same signals used for transmission without the need for an actual measurement sensor. The system was tested by monitoring a mudflow in Central Italy and revealed its suitability as an early warning tool. More research on the integration of future low-cost hardware and eventual industrialization would provide further improvement to this promising technology.
A paired stretchable printed sensor system for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
 Blood pressure is an important daily bio-signal but continuous monitoring of blood pressure is not an easy task. Continuous measurement of blood pressure can be provided with pulse arrival time (PAT) which is calculated by electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pulse wave. In this study, dry conformable and stretchable ECG electrodes and a printed accelerometer are assembled into a wearable device which is aiming for continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Clear ECG signals which are comparable in shape and strength with those from the conventional wet electrode have been obtained. And reliable blood pulse wave with valid peripheral augmentation index is registered by the printed accelerometer. By utilizing paired printed sensors, the PAT is extracted from time difference between R-peak of the ECG signal and starting point of the pulse wave. Finally, a fitting line which is obtained from the graph of PAT vs. reference blood pressure estimates blood pressure reliably with intermittent exercises.
Speed and attenuation of acoustic waves in snow: Laboratory experiments and modeling with Biot's theory
 Monitoring acoustic emissions (AE) prior to imminent failure is considered a promising technique for assessing snow slope instability. Gaps in elastic wave propagation characteristics in snow hinder quantitative interpretation of AE signals. Our study focuses on characterizing the propagation of acoustic reference signals in the ultrasonic range across cylindrical snow samples with varying density (240–450 kg m− 3). We deduced the acoustic attenuation coefficient within snow by performing experiments with different column lengths to eliminate possible influences of the snow-sensor coupling. The attenuation coefficient was measured for the entire burst signal and for single frequency components in the range of 8 to 35 kHz. The acoustic wave propagation speed, calculated from the travel time of the acoustic signal, varied between 300 m s− 1 and 950 m s− 1, depending on the density and hardness of snow. From the sound speed we also estimated the Young's modulus of our snow samples; the values of the modulus ranged from 30 to 340 MPa for densities between 240 and 450 kg m− 3. In addition, we modeled the sound propagation for our experimental setup using Biot's model for wave propagation in a porous medium. The model results were in good agreement with our experimental results and suggest that our acoustic signals consisted of Biot's slow and fast waves. Our results can be used to improve the identification and localization of acoustic emission sources within snow in view of assessing snow slope instability.
A flexible numerical approach for non-destructive ultrasonic testing based on a time-domain spectral-element method: Ultrasonic modeling of Lamb waves in immersed defective structures and of bulk waves in damaged anisotropic materials
 This paper deals with the introduction of a spectral-element method, in the time domain, to address problems of ultrasonic wave propagation in the field of the nondestructive ultrasonic testing and evaluation. Two kinds of problems are addressed. The first focuses on guided waves that are often used to control immersed layered defective structures. The second focuses on the use of bulk waves to inspect layered anisotropic media that may contain a defect. This full-wave technique allows for the use of significantly coarser meshes compared to other standard finite-element methods that can be used for non-flat defective or damaged models, as using one element per shortest wavelength is sufficient. It is thus well suited to the simulation of wave propagation phenomena in complex structures at high frequencies. With the goal of first validating our approach for simple cases, we begin by presenting results of simulations for a homogeneous plate. We compare the dispersion curves obtained with the analytical ones. The results are in excellent agreement, and the spectral-element method is fast enough to allow for simulations having a high level of accuracy. We then reproduce and analyze the transmission losses of a quasi plane wave across the immersed plate, and discuss the influence of the finite size of the ultrasonic beam in real physical experiments. We subsequently study the transmission of an ultrasonic wave through an immersed tri-layer composed of two aluminum plates glued together and with a defect, a model that is already not accessible to quasi-analytical calculation techniques. We again determine the dispersion curves, and then study transmission through the structure having a delamination defect compared to transmission through a healthy structure. We then compute the dispersion curves of the same tri-layer structure but with a varying glue thickness. These dispersion curves are compared to those of the healthy structure. We then perform a three-dimensional simulation of a pulse-echo experiment in an immersed medium composed of layers of transversely-isotropic austenitic steel, the axis of symmetry of each layer being tilted differently. This medium represents a very simple model of a weld, in which we include two kinds of defects: a gas bubble resulting from the welding process, and then a branching and crossing Y-shaped crack resulting e.g. from aging. We illustrate their effect on ultrasonic waves by computing the scattered field.
Thickness shear mode acoustic wave sensors for characterizing the viscoelastic properties of cell monolayer
 The thickness shear mode (TSM) quartz crystal resonator attached with living cells has been shown to be an effective functional biosensing device to monitor the process of cell adhesion to a surface in real time. In this study, a multilayer acoustic wave sensor model including a quartz resonator substrate, a cell-substrate interfacial layer and a cell layer has been developed based on the state of cell adhesion to the quartz resonator substrate. In order to obtain comprehensive and detailed information on the resonator oscillation, the electrical admittance spectrum of the resonator sensor over a range of frequencies near resonance is measured by an impedance analyzer instead of only measuring the resonance frequency and motional resistance with an oscillator circuit. After cells are fully spread to form a monolayer on the surface, the admittance spectrum of the multilayer loaded acoustic wave sensor was recorded and used to extract the viscoelastic properties of the cell layer by fitting experimental spectrum curve with those obtained from the theoretical model through a curve-fitting algorithm. It is found that the viscoelastic properties of the cell layer are consistent with those measured by other techniques, indicating the quartz acoustic wave sensor can be used as a non-invasive device for characterizing the mechanical properties of cell layers.
Modelling of interactions between Barely Visible Impact Damages and Lamb waves in CFRP laminates.
 The improvement of the current design practice, especially for conventional materials, has allowed the production of structures able to better tolerate the presence of cracks and, in general, damages under the in-service loading conditions. As a result, especially in the aerospace field, nowadays, the damage tolerance philosophy is the core of the current design practice. However, conversely to the conventional materials, composite materials still cannot count on established prediction models supporting the damage tolerance approach. Among the critical damages which could affect composite materials, BVIDs (Barely Visible Impact Damages) due to accidental Low Velocity Impact (LVI) phenomena play a critical role. Since they cannot be easily detectable during the inspection intervals, in order to fulfil the damage tolerance targets, large safety factors are applied during the design current practice, resulting in the oversizing of the structure. For these reasons, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are being widely used for the improvement of the current design practice, allowing the damage detection. Thanks to the possibility to assess the structural health during the in-service loading conditions, Lamb waves, among the several non-destructive testing (NDT), appear to be the best candidate for damage detection. Studies on this topic are never enough and the literature cannot still count on a Finite Element (FE) procedure able to simulate Lamb wave propagation on LVI damaged plates. This work deals with a FE procedure, developed by using the FE code Abaqus v.6.14®, for the simulation of the interaction between ultrasonic guided waves and LVI damages in composite laminates, whose damages have been modelled by means of Hashin criteria in a previous impact simulation.
Wave mitigation in ordered networks of granular chains
 We study the propagation of stress waves through ordered 2D networks of granular chains. The quasi-particle continuum theory employed captures the acoustic pulse splitting, bending, and recombination through the network and is used to derive its effective acoustic properties. The strong wave mitigation properties of the network predicted theoretically are confirmed through both numerical simulations and experimental tests. In particular, the leading pulse amplitude propagating through the system is shown to decay exponentially with the propagation distance and the spatial structure of the transmitted wave shows an exponential localization along the direction of the incident wave. The length scales that characterized these exponential decays are studied and determined as a function of the geometrical properties of the network. These results open avenues for the design of efficient impact mitigating structures and provide new insights into the mechanisms of wave propagation in granular matter.
Soot template TiO2 fractals as a photoactive gas sensor for acetone detection
 Using candle soot fractal-like structures as a template to introduce porosity, TiO2 surfaces with visible-blind photoactivity for acetone gas sensing applications were developed, which would otherwise be impossible with thin films of TiO2 formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The photoactivity performance was obtained at low operating potentials, with a high UV response repeatability (∼99%) even towards low UV intensities of μW·cm−2, thus making it suitable for light-assisted gas sensing applications. The acetone gas sensing functionality can be used for non-invasive diabetic diagnoses as the sensing mechanism takes advantage of the developed material’s photoactivity, thus enhancing both sensitivity and selectivity towards acetone gas. This enables the sensor to discriminate between acetone concentrations associated with both healthy and diabetic concentrations in human breath while exhibiting a repeatability and detection limit of >97% and 10 ppb, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the high film porosity and fractal like network structures, thus enhancing the number of gas-solid interactions as well as having titania crystalline structure with good optical excitement in the UV range.
A label-free detector for liquid chromatography systems using mm-wave technology: First proof of concept
 The development of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology has enabled the study of bio-molecular interactions by means of electromagnetic waves with frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz. In this study, an attempt has been made to exploit the possibility of mm-wave technology as alternative detection technique for liquid chromatographic (LC) systems. The goal is to design and fabricate a label-free mm-wave detector that is compatible with LC systems. As proof-of-concept experiments, the UV absorbing compounds praziquantel and trans-stilbene-oxide as well as a non-UV absorbing compound sorbitol are injected in an open capillary as well as a capillary with stationary phase and measured by both mm-wave and UV detectors. The in-house developed mm-wave detector is capable of detecting all compounds without the need for labelling. Although the detection limit of such detector still needs to be verified and occasionally improved in the future, it already shows great potential as an additional detection technique for LC systems.
Shear horizontal wave propagation in a periodic stubbed plate and its application in rainbow trapping
 The high-order waveguide modal theory, usually used in electromagnetics and acoustics, is adopted to investigate the propagation properties of shear horizontal waves in a periodic stubbed plate. Beyond the sub-wavelength regime, higher-order modes are included to calculate the exact band structures caused by the stubs. Theoretical solutions are obtained in a closed form, in which both the dynamic governing equations and the boundary conditions are strictly satisfied. It is shown that the proposed modelling approach exhibits good convergence and accuracy, in agreement with results obtained from the finite element method. After a systematic investigation on the influence of the stub on the evolution of the band structures, the so-called rainbow trapping phenomenon of SH waves is revealed and explored in a graded stubbed plate with monotonously increasing height or width of the stubs, featuring an obvious reduction of the group velocity and blocking of the wave propagation at different locations for SH waves of different frequencies. The proposed model is expected to provide a useful theoretical tool for the physical mechanism exploration, structural design and eventually system optimization to guide various engineering applications of SH waves.
Numerical Simulation of the Lamb Wave Propagation in Impacted CFRP Laminate
 Among Non-Destructive Testing, guided ultrasonic Lamb waves are particularly suitable for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications for composite structures because of their sensitivity to damage. This paper presents a numerical simulation technique for guided waves propagation in damaged composite laminates by using the finite element code Abaqus®. The damage modeling has been achieved by lowering the elastic material properties of the area affected by damages. Lamb waves propagation have been performed on both undamaged and damaged laminate, in order to investigate the detection criteria. In particular, the influence of different parameters such as the shape, size and extend of damage on the damage reflected wave has been studied.
Reliable Sensor Location for Object Positioning and Surveillance via Trilateration
 Object positioning and surveillance has been playing an important role in various indoor location-aware applications. Signal attenuation or blockage often requires multiple local sensors to be used jointly to provide coverage and determine object locations via mobile devices. The deployment of sensors has a significant impact on the accuracy of positioning and effectiveness of surveillance. In this paper, we develop a reliable sensor location model that aims at optimizing the location of sensors so as to maximize the accuracy of object positioning/surveillance under the risk of possible sensor disruptions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and develop solution approaches based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm with an embedded approximation subroutine. A series of hypothetical examples and a real-world Wi-Fi access point design problem for Chicago O’Hare Airport Terminal 5 are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model and solution algorithms. Managerial insights are also presented.
Cross-shore variability and vorticity dynamics during wave breaking on a fixed bar
 In the present experiments a volumetric particle-tracking system (V3V from TSI Inc.) allowed the measurement of the velocity fields generated by regular breaking waves past a fixed bar on a 1:10 rigid plane slope. The measurement volume extended from the wave crest to a portion of the domain below the wave trough, with two sets of monochromatic wave trains with different periods and heights. The aim of the present work is the quantification of the terms in the vorticity balance equation by including all the terms in a fully 3D approach. A possible new vorticity generation mechanism is revealed, that is amplified by the geometry of the laboratory flume and that awaits experimental validation in 3D wave tanks and in the field. The results are new and original and represent a data set for the comprehension of the effects of a submerged berm, for developing conceptual models of vorticity and for the calibration of numerical codes.
Synthetic aperture processing for passive co-prime linear sensor arrays
 In this paper, we explore the use of synthetic aperture processing for optimizing the spatial covariance estimation capabilities of a moving linear co-prime sensor array. The linear co-prime sensor array geometry is a thinned linear array that is constructed by nesting uniform linear arrays with inter-related element spacing factors. The application of synthetic aperture processing in this setting is designed to create virtual sensors at missing half-wavelength intervals up to the degree required to produce a hole-free difference co-array across the full aperture of the synthetic array. Once a full set of spatial covariances are estimated covariance matrix based array processing methods can be applied as if the synthetic array were a uniform linear array. In this sense, the synthetic array is designed to approximate a uniform linear array while it retains a thinned linear array structure. We show simulation results examining the quality of the uniform linear array approximation afforded by this application synthetic aperture processing.
A low-noise CMOS pixel direct charge sensor, Topmetal-II-
 We report the design and characterization of a CMOS pixel direct charge sensor, Topmetal-II-, fabricated in a standard 0.35 μm CMOS Integrated Circuit process. The sensor utilizes exposed metal patches on top of each pixel to directly collect charge. Each pixel contains a low-noise charge-sensitive preamplifier to establish the analog signal and a discriminator with tunable threshold to generate hits. The analog signal from each pixel is accessible through time-shared multiplexing over the entire array. Hits are read out digitally through a column-based priority logic structure. Tests show that the sensor achieved a <15e− analog noise and a 200e− minimum threshold for digital readout per pixel. The sensor is capable of detecting both electrons and ions drifting in gas. These characteristics enable its use as the charge readout device in future Time Projection Chambers without gaseous gain mechanism, which has unique advantages in low background and low rate-density experiments.
On the coupling mechanism between nonlinear solitary waves and slender beams
 This paper describes the coupling mechanism between highly nonlinear solitary waves propagating along a granular system and slender beams in contact with the granular medium. Nonlinear solitary waves are compact non-dispersive waves that can form and travel in nonlinear systems such as one-dimensional chains of particles, where they are conventionally generated by the mechanical impact of a striker. These waves have a constant spatial wavelength and their speed, amplitude, and duration can be tuned by modifying the particles’ material or size, or the velocity of the striker. In the study presented in this article we investigated numerically the interaction between solitary waves propagating along a chain of granular particles and a slender beam. Some of the numerical findings were validated experimentally. We found that the geometric and mechanical properties of the beam or thermal stress applied to the beam alter certain features of the solitary waves. In the future, these findings may be used to develop a novel sensing system for the nondestructive assessment of beams.
Acoustic wave based biosensor to study electroacoustic based detection of progressive (SW-48) colon cancer cells from primary (HT-29) cells
 A travelling surface acoustic wave (TSAW) biosensor on a LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate is designed and fabricated to study the proliferation of HT-29 and SW-48 cancer cells. The device integrates double interdigital transducers (IDTs) in which the travelling SAW (TSAW) is operating at around 10.3-MHz-centered medical band. The experiments were carried out using label free method, with and without the presence of cell media culture, primary (HT-29) and progressive (SW-48) colon cancer cells. It was noted that at the presence of cancer cells, the sensor response was considerably altered, mostly due to the electroacoustic effect. However, presence of the culture media solution did not have a considerable impact on the frequency response of the biosensors in respect to cells attachment situation. The resonance peaks at the presence of HT-29 cells had fewer shifts toward lower frequencies, compared to SW-48 cells, because of the lower amount of negative electrical charges acquired over the membrane of HT-29 cells. Finite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics® software package is carried out. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. It is suggested that using the proposed biosensor is a promising path to detect the proliferation of cancer cells.
Traveling waves in the martian atmosphere from MGS TES Nadir data
 We have characterized the annual behavior of martian atmospheric traveling waves in the MGS TES data set from the first two martian years of mapping. There is a high degree of repeatability between the two years. They are dominated by strong low zonal wavenumber waves with high amplitudes near the polar jets, strongest in late northern fall and early northern winter. The m=1 waves have amplitudes up to about 20 K, are vertically extended, and occasionally extend even into the tropics. Periods for m=1 range from 2.5 to 30 sols. Much weaker waves were identified in the south, with amplitudes less than about 3.5 K. Traveling waves with m=2 and m=3 are also seen, but their amplitudes are typically limited to less than 4 K, and are generally more confined near the surface. In the north, they are more evident in fall and spring rather than winter solstice, which is clearly dominated by m=1 waves. Some evidence of storm tracks has been identified in the data, with accentuated weather-related temperature perturbations near longitudes 200° to 320° E for both the southern and northern hemispheres near latitude ±65° at the surface. Some evidence was also found for a sharpening of longitudinal gradients into what may be frontal systems. EP flux divergences show the waves extracting energy from the zonal mean winds. When the m=1 waves were strongest, decelerations of the zonal jet of order 30 m/(s sol) were measured. Above 1 scale height, the waves extract energy from the jet predominately through barotropic processes, but their character is overall mixed barotropic/baroclinic. Inertial instabilities may exist at altitude on the equatorward flanks of the polar jets, and marginal stability extends through to the tropics. This may explain the coordination of the tropical behavior of the waves with that centered along the polar jet, consistent with the ideas expressed in Wilson et al. (2002, Geophys. Res. Lett. 29, #1684) and similar to those in Barnes et al. (1993, J. Geophys. Res. 98, 3125–3148). Throughout the year, there exist large regions with the meridional gradient of PV less than zero, but they are strongest near winter solstice. Poleward of the winter jet, the regions of instability reach the surface, equatorward they do not. These regions, satisfying a necessary criterion for instability, likely explain the genesis of the waves, and perhaps also their bimodal character between surface (faster waves) and altitude (slow m=1 waves).
Delamination detection in composite laminates using high-frequency P- and S-waves – Part I: Theory and analysis
 A structural health monitoring (SHM) technique that exploits piezoelectric-induced ultrasonic waves propagating across the thickness of composite laminates is proposed to detect the presence of inter-layer delaminations. The damage-induced lag in the times of arrival of primary (P) and secondary (S) elastic waves is exploited as the key mechanism to enhance the detection capabilities. The theoretical aspects of the design of the proposed SHM procedure for thin-walled multi-layered structures are presented first. Two- and three-dimensional numerical analyses of the wave propagation across the thickness of composite laminates with a single delamination are carried out. A correlation between the delamination position and the percent variations of the time of flight (ToF) of P- and S-waves is found. Strong modulation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the output signals is obtained for delaminations close to the surface onto which the actuator–sensor pair is mounted. While for the latter no additional information about their position in the laminate stacking sequence is obtained, for deeper delaminations the proposed procedure delivers very accurate estimates of the damage location. The experimental validation of the described delamination detection technique is carried out in the second part of this study (Pasquali et al., in press [1]).
Wave interaction with an oscillating wave surge converter, Part I: Viscous effects
 Bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converters are known to be an efficient method of extracting power from ocean waves. The present work deals with experimental and numerical studies of wave interactions with an oscillating wave surge converter. It focuses on two aspects: (1) viscous effects on device performance under normal operating conditions; and (2) effects of slamming on device survivability under extreme conditions. Part I deals with the viscous effects while the extreme sea conditions will be presented in Part II. The numerical simulations are performed using the commercial CFD package ANSYS FLUENT. The comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements shows excellent agreement in terms of capturing local features of the flow as well as the dynamics of the device. A series of simulations is conducted with various wave conditions, flap configurations and model scales to investigate the viscous and scaling effects on the device. It is found that the diffraction/radiation effects dominate the device motion and that the viscous effects are negligible for wide flaps.
Quantification of Acoustic Variability from Thermohaline Fields in the Arabian Sea
 Acoustic waves, when they propagate in water, exhibit fluctuations in their spectral characteristics due to multi-path and ocean medium variability, especially in coastal waters. Quantitative knowledge of these received signal fluctuations is essential to understand the randomness of acoustic wave propagation. Acoustic variability in the ocean can be attributed to various oceanographic processes such as fronts, eddies and internal waves. Internal waves are ubiquitous in the ocean and cause acoustic fluctuation due to perturbations in sound speed. Fluctuation of an acoustic pulse travelling in the presence of internal wave can be quantified using parameters such as travel time variance and frequency spread. Quantification of travel time variance using the thermohaline data is the focus of this paper. Here, we have quantified an acoustic fluctuation parameter as a function of sound speed variance. The buoyancy frequency, which is the upper frequency bound, is estimated to characterize the internal wave field. These two quantities are estimated using temperature and salinity profiles at a particular location in the Arabian Sea. We have estimated the coherence length for different grazing angles of acoustic waves from buoyancy frequencies for various source - receiver geometry. In this paper, attempts have been made to compute the travel time variance with range using sound speed variance and coherence length. This parameter describes the coherent nature of the received acoustic signals which would be required for the performance analysis of underwater sensors. The travel time variance is found to be dependent on the launch angle(upto8°), with maximum variability for higher angles.
Zooming into individuals to understand the collective: A review of trajectory-based travel behaviour studies
 Understanding travel behaviour is significant in travel demand management as well as in urban and transport planning. Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this field are proposed for future studies.
Poly (N-vinylcarbazole)-polypyrrole/graphene oxide nanocomposites based microfiber interferometer for high stability temperature sensor
 An all-optical, highly stable temperature sensor based built around Poly (N-vinylcarbazole)-polypyrrole/graphene oxide nanocomposites (PNVC-PPy-GO) deposited on an inline Microfiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer (IMMZI) is investigated and demonstrated. Depositing the PNVC-PPy-GO solution on the IMMZI is seen to enhance the temperature sensing stability, and the resulting wavelength shift as a result of heating the IMMZI with a heating element was linearly proportional to temperature variations, and observed to be stable and uniform. The sensitivity and resolution of the sensor after deposition improves by about 7 pm/°C and 0.18 °C respectively, as compared to the sensor before deposition. The IMMZI with PNVC-PPy-GO coating will be a highly viable candidate for sensing applications requiring highly stable and precise measurements.
Nonlinear elastic wave tomography for the imaging of corrosion damage
 This paper presents a nonlinear elastic wave tomography method, based on ultrasonic guided waves, for the image of nonlinear signatures in the dynamic response of a damaged isotropic structure. The proposed technique relies on a combination of high order statistics and a radial basis function approach. The bicoherence of ultrasonic waveforms originated by a harmonic excitation was used to characterise the second order nonlinear signature contained in the measured signals due to the presence of surface corrosion. Then, a radial basis function interpolation was employed to achieve an effective visualisation of the damage over the panel using only a limited number of receiver sensors. The robustness of the proposed nonlinear imaging method was experimentally demonstrated on a damaged 2024 aluminium panel, and the nonlinear source location was detected with a high level of accuracy, even with few receiving elements. Compared to five standard ultrasonic imaging methods, this nonlinear tomography technique does not require any baseline with the undamaged structure for the evaluation of the corrosion damage, nor a priori knowledge of the mechanical properties of the specimen.
Sensor-Assisted Machining
 This chapter provides comprehensive knowledge regarding the application of various sensors and monitoring techniques to machining processes, cutting tools and machine tools. A number of monitoring methods used in manufacturing and relevant sensors are characterized. In particular, three most frequently used sensors, i.e., force, acceleration and acoustic emission, are presented and their characteristics and advantages are highlighted. The architectures of multiple-sensor tool-monitoring systems for detection of tool wear and breakage and collision for machine tools, including details of sensor fusion, signal processing and decision-making, are presented. Moreover, the concepts of sensor-based intelligent manufacturing system and adaptive control systems are involved. The principles and practical applications of touch probing for the workpiece and tool setting probing, and typical designs of touch probes are provided. Machine vision systems, machine vision sensors and using their in-line inspection of part quality are outline. Smart and intelligent (mechatronic) cutting tools which can monitor the machining process and communicate with the CNC system are described. Some developing trends in sensor-assisted manufacturing are discussed.
Radar technology: radio frequency, interferometric, millimeter wave and terahertz sensors for assessing and monitoring civil infrastructures
 Radar and millimeter wave methods provide a means of remote and noncontacting examination of structures through controlled electromagnetic (EM) interactions. Metallic and nonmetallic structures reflect and scatter EM waves impinging at the outer surfaces. Nonmetallic, i.e., dielectric, materials allow for EM waves to penetrate the surface, and scatter or reflect off of subsurface objects and features. Actively measuring surface and subsurface reflectivity and scattering by the controlled launching and receiving of EM waves provides information that when suitably processed can indicate surface and subsurface feature geometry, material properties, and overall structural condition. These active EM technical tests are often called ‘Ground Penetrating Radar’ for EM wave frequencies less than about 10 GHz and ‘Millimeter Wave’ methods for those at higher frequencies. This chapter describes the range of uses, operating principles, signal processing, and data interpretation for these methods.
On the transfer of momentum from a granular landslide to a water wave
 The momentum flux from a landslide at impact in a water body is the driving force behind the generation of landslide tsunamis. Analysis of this problem is presented and used to derive idealized theoretical relationships for the maximum wave amplitude in the near-field zone. This is accomplished for momentum transfer using both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic assumptions. For rapidly evolving near-field waves with a supercritical densimetric Froude number, the maximum wave amplitude is also constrained according to the fluid continuity equation. Simplification of the hydrostatic momentum equation is also presented by considering fluid acceleration, resulting in an expression that is independent of length and time scales during wave generation. The results of the novel momentum-based equations are in agreement with laboratory data collected using high-speed digital cameras for granular landslides and previously published experimental data used to develop a semi-empirical equation. Furthermore, the results provide new insight on the range of applicability of theoretical and semi-empirical equations for predicting the maximum near-field wave amplitude of landslide-generated tsunamis.
Soil Dynamic Parameters Determination by Waves Spectral and Correlation Analysis
 Assessment of soil dynamic parameters via wave propagation method utilizing results of theoretical and experimental analysis of elastic or visco–elastic waves. The theory underlying the problem of stress–wave propagation in half space medium is based on the assumption of an application of the impulse–seismic methods (ISM) or the phase velocity method. In this paper is only outlining the basic of the theoretical subject which is necessary for experimental applications. ISM experimental study of ground stress–wave propagation permits the ground to be modelled as a damped, viscoelastic half space. The viscoelastic model of soil simulation using the complex modulus conception, offers a very good approach to the actual soil behavior. The paper also presents the experimental ISM tests procedure in–situ and results obtained by correlation and spectral analysis. As an example, the finite element method (FEM) was in a case study also used for modelling the body and surface wave propagation processes in the ground modelled as an elastic medium.
Attenuation of reflected waves in man during retrograde propagation from femoral artery to proximal aorta
 Wave reflection may be an important influence on blood pressure, but the extent to which reflections undergo attenuation during retrograde propagation has not been studied. We quantified retrograde transmission of a reflected wave created by occlusion of the left femoral artery in man. 20 subjects (age 31–83 years; 14 male) underwent invasive measurement of pressure and flow velocity with a sensor-tipped intra-arterial wire at multiple locations distal to the proximal aorta before, during and following occlusion of the left femoral artery by thigh cuff inflation. A numerical model of the circulation was also used to predict reflected wave transmission. Wave reflection was measured as the ratio of backward to forward wave energy (WRI) and the ratio of peak backward to forward pressure (Pb/Pf). Cuff inflation caused a marked reflection which was largest at 5–10 cm from the cuff (change (Δ) in WRI = 0.50 (95% CI 0.38, 0.62); p < 0.001, ΔPb/Pf = 0.23 (0.18–0.29); p < 0.001). The magnitude of the cuff-induced reflection decreased progressively at more proximal locations and was barely discernible at sites > 40 cm from the cuff including in the proximal aorta. Numerical modelling gave similar predictions to those observed experimentally. Reflections due to femoral artery occlusion are markedly attenuated by the time they reach the proximal aorta. This is due to impedance mismatches of bifurcations traversed in the backward direction. This degree of attenuation is inconsistent with the idea of a large discrete reflected wave arising from the lower limb and propagating back into the aorta.
Triboelectric nanogenerators as self-powered active sensors
 The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes, developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop environmental energy harvesting devices for driving the traditional sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors – self-powered active sensors – that can actively generate electrical signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient environment. The recent invention and intensive development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions, including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more.
Transformation of a wave energy spectrum from encounter to absolute domain when observing from an advancing ship
 The article presents a practical approach to transform a wave energy spectrum from encounter domain to absolute domain. This problem has its specific relevance, when shipboard sea state estimation is conducted by the wave buoy analogy; notably for some particular implementation solving for the sea state directly in the encounter domain. In this context, the encounter domain is that observed from a ship when it advances in a seaway, whereas the absolute domain is that corresponding to making observations from a fixed point in the inertial frame. Spectrum transformation can be uniquely carried out if the ship sails “against” the waves (beam to head sea) but in following sea conditions there exists no unique solution to the problem. Instead, a reasonable approach valid for practical engineering must be applied, and the article outlines one viable solution that can be used to transform a wave spectrum from encounter to absolute domain. Specifically, two pseudo algorithms are presented, and good performance is achieved with both algorithms when they are tested at different operational scenarios.
EM-Based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks
 In this chapter, fundamental building blocks of electromagnetic (EM)-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) are presented. A detailed introduction to the dynamics of the soil medium, in which WUSNs are deployed, is provided. Then, physical layer underground channel characteristics, communication, and propagation models are analyzed. Error control models are presented, and WUSN connectivity model is discussed. Empirical evaluation is important to get deep insight into the underground channel. To this end, testbed design and experimental approaches are also described.
Scattering of evanescent waves by a sensor tip near a plane surface
 The paper is devoted to the application of a rigorous approach for analyzing the evanescent wave scattering by sensor tip near a plane surface. On the basis of the discrete sources method a numerical schemes was developed and implemented in computer program. Numerical results related to the influence of the position of the sensor tip on the scattering characteristics are discussed.
Imaging surface acoustic wave dynamics in semiconducting polymers by scanning ultrafast electron microscopy
 Understanding the mechanical properties of organic semiconductors is essential to their electronic and photovoltaic applications. Despite a large volume of research directed toward elucidating the chemical, physical and electronic properties of these materials, little attention has been directed toward understanding their thermo-mechanical behavior. Here, we report the ultrafast imaging of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on the surface of the Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) thin film at the picosecond and nanosecond timescales. We then use these images to measure the propagation velocity of SAWs, which we then employ to determine the Young's modulus of P3HT. We further validate our experimental observation by performing a semi-empirical transient thermoelastic finite element analysis. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ultrafast electron microscopy to not only probe charge carrier dynamics in materials as previously reported, but also to measure their mechanical properties with great accuracy. This is particularly important when in situ characterization of stiffness for thin devices and nanomaterials is required.
The anisotropic propagation of ultrasonic guided waves in composite materials and implications for practical applications
 Ultrasonic guided wave propagation in anisotropic attenuative materials like CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) is much more complicated than in isotropic materials. Propagation phenomena need to be understood and quantified before reliable NDE (Non-destructive Evaluation)/SHM (Structural Health Monitoring) inspection systems can be realized. The propagation characteristics: energy velocity, dispersion, mode coupling, energy focusing factor and attenuation are considered in this paper. Concepts of minimum resolvable distance and sensitivity maps are extended to anisotropic attenuative materials in order to provide the means for comparison of different guided wave modes in composite materials. The paper is intended to serve as a framework for evaluating and comparing different modes and choosing the optimum operating conditions (frequency, sensor layout) for possible NDE/SHM applications on composite materials. Fundamental guided wave modes in the low frequency regime for highly anisotropic CFRP plates are investigated experimentally and theoretically and the implications for NDE/SHM are discussed.
Single-mode optical fibre surface plasma wave chemical sensor
 We describe a new design of optical fibre surface plasma wave chemical sensor. The basic sensor consists of a tapered single-mode optical fibre with a thin layer of silver evaporated onto the tapered section. The gradually changing diameter of the fibre along the taper and the variation in silver depth around the taper result in a distributed coupling between the guided mode of the fibre and the surface plasma wave. As a result, the coupling to the surface plasma wave occurs over an enlarged spectral range. The device shows good sensitivity to refractive index with refractive index changes of 5 × 10 −4 being detectable. The device is compact, simple to make, and has applications as a biochemical or immunosensor.
Computational Turbulent Shear Flows Over Growing And Non-Growing Wave Groups
 A high-Reynolds-number second-order stress closure model is used to perform numerical simulations of the wind flow above different groups of waves. It is shown that the group profiles can change as the individual waves grow within its envelop due to the energy transfer between the wind and the group. The focus of this study is the behaviour of the critical-layer and the associated with "cat’s-eye" structures which are centred around the critical height, where the real part of the complex wave speed is equal to the mean flow velocity. It is also shown that the position and size of these structures depend on the wave age and the wave steepness. It is demonstrated that the larger these structures become, the greater disturbance of the wind flow above the wave groups appear. Also, the results obtained here demonstrate how the critical layer structures are asymmetrical over the waves within a group because of the shear driven sheltering effect on the downwind side of the group. The results here complement the general review of wind-wave dynamics by Hunt & Sajjadi [1].
Flexural plate-wave gravimetric chemical sensor
 We describe the use of flexural plate waves traveling in thin composite plates of zinc oxide, aluminum and silicon nitride for gravimetric chemical sensing. Theoretical and experimental results show that, compared to bulk- and surfacewave gravimetric sensors, flexural plate-wave sensors are more sensitive to added mass while operating at significantly lower frequencies. Experiments with sorptive poly(dimethylsiloxane) films exposed to vapors of toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride demonstrated the high sensitivity of the plate sensor and detection in the parts-per-million range.
A sensitivity-enhanced flexible acoustic sensor using side-polished fiber Bragg grating
 A miniature flexible fiber Bragg grating (FBG) acoustic sensor with enhanced pressure sensitivity was fabricated by using a side-polished configuration of ∼54 μm depth and ∼15 mm length. The photoelectromechanical response of the sensor suspended as a dual-end-fixed beam was characterized based on the acoustic-induced strain interaction with fiber gratings. The opto-mechanical response of the sensor to bending strain was firstly investigated and exhibited about 11 times larger in wavelength shift, in comparison with a conventional bare FBG. Then acoustic testing demonstrated an acoustic pressure-induced wavelength shift of 0.041 nm/Pa and a noise equivalent acoustic signal level of ∼1.66 mPa/Hz1/2 in the frequency region around 2.5 kHz. Also, a relative flat frequency response with a fluctuation of less than 12.9 dB was achieved in the measurement between 400 Hz and 20 kHz, which is in well agreement with the result obtained by a reference condenser microphone. Along with strain-sensitive nanomaterials, the use of the side-polished FBG could be further extended for highly sensitive acousto-ultrasonic sensors in structural health monitoring and wearable applications.
Numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation and ground motion in underground mines
 Dynamic rock support plays a critical role in ensuring mine safety and its design depends on several key design inputs. For rock support design and forensic analysis of rockburst damage, it is important to understand seismic wave propagation and ground motion distribution near excavation boundaries for seismic waves generated from a remote fault slip seismic event. This study aims at achieving a better understanding of wave propagation patterns around mine tunnels and capturing ground motion (Peak Particle Velocity - PPV) accurately for dynamic support design and forensic analysis. An advanced seismic wave propagation modeling tool, SPECFEM2D, is used to study complex wave propagation in underground mines. Attentions are paid to studying the influence of different mine excavations and geological structures on wavefields and ground motions near excavation boundaries. The simulation results show that the wavefields and the ground motion distributions become more complicated as more mine excavations and geological structures are involved. Moreover, the PPV distribution around a tunnel can be altered, leading to high and low PPV zones around the tunnel. In addition, modulation of travel time and long S-coda waves can be observed in the complex seismograms. Using the modeling approach, areas in an underground mine that may experience high potentials of rockburst damage could be identified and mine safety could be improved by implementing dynamic rock ground support in these areas.
Nondestructive analysis techniques for freeze-thaw damage detection in concrete slabs using shear waves
 Freeze-thaw damage in concrete structures is a serious issue for infrastructure in cold regions. Accurate detection of this type of damage at early stages allows for the selection of optimum strategies for preservation and rehabilitation activities. This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing ultrasonic shear wave technology, called MIRA, for quantification of damage in concrete slabs for the detection of freeze-thaw damage. Four slabs with varying levels of freeze-thaw damage were tested and two analysis techniques were developed to characterize the damage present. These methods involve the formulation of reconstruction images to analyze the subsurface condition, as well as the creation of a numerical index based upon recorded shear wave signal characteristics. The results of both analyses showed agreement both with each other and with the visual survey assessments for detection of freeze-thaw damage. However, the methods were also able to detect damage in portions of the slab where no visual cracks were observed. These techniques showed promise for an accurate nondestructive quantification of the extent of freeze-thaw damage, or similar damage manifestations, in concrete structures. Advantages of the methods include their applicability on in-situ concrete infrastructure for determining real-time concrete condition, without requiring previous measurements for comparative purposes.
Modal-based finite elements for efficient wave propagation analysis
 We present an extension to the Geometric Multi-Scale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) to better predict the dynamic response of heterogeneous materials and structures. The proposed method utilizes GMsFEM elements enriched by a number of vibration normal modes over the element domain. These modes can be calculated either numerically or analytically after imposing a proper set of boundary conditions at the element boundaries. In order to preserve many of the features of GMsFEM, including automatic enforcement of continuity across element boundaries, our enrichment functions are forced to be zero-valued at the boundaries. We applied our methodology to modeling one-dimensional stress wave propagation in smooth and notched bars, and two-dimensional stress wave propagation in a periodic elastic domain with a notch. For the problems of interest, we show that the enrichment functions provide a systematic way to increase the precision of GMsFEM while also leading to larger values of the stable time increment. In the traditional Finite Element Method (FEM), the stable time increment is dictated by the size of the smallest element in the domain. This can lead to simulations with a prohibitive computational cost when the FEM mesh is required to resolve small geometric features within a larger simulation domain of interest. In contrast, our method appears to be insensitive to small geometric features, with the stable time increment depending only on the chosen element nodes and the highest enrichment frequency.
The optimal design and experimental verification of the bias magnet configuration of a magnetostrictive sensor for bending wave measurement
 A magnetostrictive sensor has been used for the non-contact measurement of elastic stress waves in ferromagnetic waveguides. The performance of the sensor is affected significantly by the bias magnetic field applied around the sensor installation location. The objective of the present investigation is to find an optimal bias magnet configuration to maximize the sensor output for bending wave measurement. To this end, we formulate a topology design optimization problem and then find an optimal magnet or magnet–yoke configuration. In designing the configuration, the manufacturability as well as the performance of the sensor is considered. To check the performance of the present sensor, we fabricate a prototype based on the proposed design and carry out measurement experiments. The experiment results reveal the superior performance of the present sensor in comparison with the existing sensor.
Fiber-optic voltage sensor using fiber gyro technology
 The technique of non-reciprocal optical phase modulation known from fiber gyroscopes is adapted to interrogate a polarimetric optical voltage sensor. The piezoelectric deformation of a transducer by an applied ac voltage is transmitted to a birefringent fiber resulting in a periodic phase shift of the two orthogonal polarizations of the fundamental fiber mode. A modulator at the detector end of the sensor introduces a nonreciprocal phase modulation of the light waves. The voltage is recovered from the first and second harmonics of the modulator frequency and side bands in the detected signal.
Impact of traveling permanent magnets on low temperature metal melting in a cuboid
 Electromagnetic methods for controlling and optimization of melting process are applied both in the laboratory conditions and in industrial processes at least within past several decades. At that, usage of rotating and traveling magnetic fields was realized based on alternating or direct current electromagnetic facilities, or on permanent magnets systems. The last-named magnetic systems for such a task can make the driving equipment simpler and more efficient in certain applications. To examine the solid–liquid interface behavior and the possibility to control its dynamics while reducing melting process duration and temperature gradients, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed that accounted the temperature dependence of the metal properties and the presence of a mushy zone. Gallium melting process in an orthogonal container with heated and cooled side walls was numerically investigated under the impact of a traveling magnetic field from below. The mentioned field was created by the moving system of permanent magnets. The volumetric distribution of temperatures and the liquid–solid interface velocities were estimated for the cases with traveling magnetic field impact and with natural convection only. Numerical model was validated by comparison between the simulation of the flow in a rectangular container completely filled with liquid metal and experimental data obtained in low temperature Gallium–Indium–Tin alloy. Flow velocity components were measured by ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter. The results of the work allow extending the capabilities for a control of interface dynamics in liquid–solid metal systems, and in choosing of the optimal parameters of similar processes.
Effect of train length on fluctuating aerodynamic pressure wave in tunnels and method for determining the amplitude of pressure wave on trains
 In this study, the aerodynamic performance of full-scale trains of different lengths going through or crossing each other in a tunnel was investigated using sliding mesh technology and a numerical algorithm developed and verified through a full-scale train test. The waveforms of the fluctuating pressure distribution on the train and in the tunnel were compared and analyzed, and the effect of the train length on the flow field in the tunnel examined. The results show that, because of the significant difference in pressure amplitude, long trains cannot be replaced by short trains when simulating trains going through or crossing each other in tunnels. However, some common regular patterns, such as the distribution of the peak values of the time evolution of pressure on the train and in the tunnel, can still be found in both cases. It was found that, for the evaluation of the fatigue effect induced by pressure on the train body, the equivalent load method based on the Paris formula is more secure and reliable than the root-mean-square equivalent load method. It was also discovered that, while analyzing the effect of the fluctuating aerodynamic pressure, it is better from the viewpoint of safety to consider the maximum pressure on the constant-section part of the train body as the representative parameter.
Scattering of SH-waves by an elliptic cavity/crack beneath the interface between functionally graded and homogeneous half-spaces via multipole expansion method
 In this study, based on multipole expansion method an analytical treatment is presented for the anti-plane scattering of SH-waves by an arbitrarily oriented elliptic cavity/crack which is embedded near the interface between exponentially graded and homogeneous half-spaces. The cavity is embedded within the inhomogeneous half-space. The boundary value problem of interest is solved by constructing an appropriate set of multipole functions which satisfy (i) the governing equation in each half-space, (ii) the continuity conditions across the interface between the two half-spaces, and (iii) the far-field radiation and regularity conditions. The analytical expressions for the scattered elastodynamic fields are derived and the dynamic stress concentration factor associated with the elliptic cavity as well as the dynamic stress intensity factor relevant to the case of a crack are calculated. In the given numerical examples, the effects of such parameters as the incident wave number, angle of the incident waves, the distance of the cavity to the bimaterial interface, and the aspect ratio and the orientation of the elliptic cavity/crack on the scattered field are addressed in detail. It is seen that such parameters have significant effect on the dynamic response of the medium.
Ultrasound Flow Sensor Based on Arrays of Piezoelectric Transducers Integrated in a Composite
 The functionalization of fiber-reinforced polymer composites by integration of piezoelectric transducers allows for both the measurement and the excitation of guided waves within the component. A common use for guided waves in composite components is nondestructive examination. In the presented work, however, the radiation of ultrasound waves from the surface of the component due to guided waves in the component is utilized. Glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) plates with integrated arrays of piezoelectric macro fiber composite (MFC) transducers are used as ultrasound transmitter and receiver. The plates are then set up as facing walls of a rectangular duct and the sound transit times between the plates are measured. From the measured sound transit times, the velocity of gas flow inside the composite duct is determined. In that way, a flow sensor integrated in the walls of a flow channel, e.g. an air duct, made of composites is built. This paper focuses on the manufacturing of such an integrated flow sensor.
Delamination detection in composite laminates using high-frequency P- and S-waves – Part II: Experimental validation
 In this work, the delamination detection procedure presented in part I is experimentally investigated (Pasquali and Lacarbonara, 2015). Attention placed on the through-the-thickness propagation direction of composite laminates undergoing delaminations. As observed in the numerical tests, a precise correlation between the delamination position and the variations of the Time of Flight (ToF) of primary (P) and secondary (S) waves is found. A substantial modulation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the acquired output signals is recorded in the case of delaminations close to the surface onto which the actuator/sensor transducers are bonded. The experimental validation of the proposed SHM procedure is carried out through extensive testing on different types of isotropic and composite specimen. A good agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions shown in part I [1] is found, together with determination of limitations on the delamination position offset with respect to the actuator–sensor pair position.
Complementary power generation of double linear switched reluctance generators for wave power exploitation
 The wave power generation system based on the single linear generator scheme has low energy output and week robustness, especially in low speed conditions and parameter variations. To overcome the problem, a scheme of complementary power compensation generation for two asymmetric bilateral linear switched reluctance generators (ABLSRGs) is proposed in this paper. Mathematic model is first derived and machine characteristics are investigated by the finite element method. The compensation scheme is carefully investigated together with the independent control method. Under the conditions of parameter and velocity variations, experimentation demonstrates that both the voltage control accuracy and system robustness can be guaranteed with the proposed complementary power generation control scheme. Experiment results show that a voltage control precision of 11.75–12.23 V can be obtained, with the voltage reference of 12 V.
Highly sensitive Escherichia coli shear horizontal surface acoustic wave biosensor with silicon dioxide nanostructures
 Surface acoustic wave mediated transductions have been widely used in the sensors and actuators applications. In this study, a shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SHSAW) was used for the detection of food pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E.coli O157:H7), a dangerous strain among 225 E. coli unique serotypes. A few cells of this bacterium are able to cause young children to be most vulnerable to serious complications. Presence of higher than 1 cfu E.coli O157:H7 in 25 g of food has been considered as a dangerous level. The SHSAW biosensor was fabricated on 64° YX LiNbO3 substrate. Its sensitivity was enhanced by depositing 130.5 nm thin layer of SiO2 nanostructures with particle size lesser than 70 nm. The nanostructures act both as a waveguide as well as a physical surface modification of the sensor prior to biomolecular immobilization. A specific DNA sequence from E. coli O157:H7 having 22 mers as an amine-terminated probe ssDNA was immobilized on the thin film sensing area through chemical functionalization [(CHO-(CH2)3-CHO) and APTES; NH2-(CH2)3-Si(OC2H5)3]. The high-performance of sensor was shown with the specific oligonucleotide target and attained the sensitivity of 0.6439 nM/0.1 kHz and detection limit was down to 1.8 femto-molar (1.8×10−15 M). Further evidence was provided by specificity analysis using single mismatched and complementary oligonucleotide sequences.
Precise Speed Control of a Travelling Wave Ultrasonic Motor for Prosthetic Hands
 A repetitive speed controller with zero phase error tracking compensation (ZPETC) is proposed to reduce the intrinsic speed ripples of travelling wave ultrasonic motors (TWUMs). The proposed control scheme is also intended to compensate the speed variations due to load and temperature changes. This controller is expected to improve the performance of the impedance control system of a prosthetic hand, which is partially powered by a TWUM. Repetitive controllers are capable of improving the response of dynamical systems under periodic disturbances by learning from the stored error values of preceding periods. Since it is desirable for the stabilizing compensator of repetitive controllers to be zero phase and a perfect error tracker, the ZPET controller is a natural choice when the servo’s closed-loop transfer function has non-minimum phase zeros. The performance of the proposed controller was compared against that of a Pi-repetitive controller and its effectiveness experimentally demonstrated.
Novel cable coupling technique for improved shallow distributed acoustic sensor VSPs
 Vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) collected using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) are becoming increasingly common; yet, ensuring good cable coupling with the borehole wall remains a persistent challenge. Traditional cable deployment techniques used in the petroleum industry are either not possible or do not provide data of sufficient quality for shallow applications. Additionally, no direct field comparison of coupling techniques in the same borehole exists to determine the impacts of poor coupling on DAS VSP data quality. This paper addresses these issues by: (1) presenting a novel cable coupling solution using a removable and relatively inexpensive FLUTe™ flexible borehole liner; and (2) presenting field examples of DAS VSPs under different coupling conditions. The proposed coupling technique is analogous to a fully cemented deployment in that the cable is continuously coupled directly to the formation. Field experiments conducted to assess and validate the technique demonstrate a marked improvement in VSP data quality when the cable is coupled with a flexible borehole liner. Without the liner, seismic profiles are dominated by a high-amplitude cable wave and the p-wave arrival is not observed; however, with cable coupling provided by a borehole liner inflated using hydrostatic pressure, the cable wave is suppressed and clear p-wave arrivals are visible. Additional tests examining the influence of fiber optic cable structure on seismic responses demonstrate that tight buffered fibers are more sensitive to dynamic strain than loose tube fibers making them potentially better suited for certain DAS applications.
Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography: Variations of Liver Fibrosis Assessment as a Function of Depth, Force and Distance from Central Axis of the Transducer with a Comparison of Different Systems
 We evaluated variation in fibrosis staging caused by depth, pre-load force and measurement off-axis distance on different ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) systems prospectively in 20 patients with diffuse liver disease. Shear wave speed (SWS) was measured with transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and 2-D shear wave elastography (SWE). ARFI and 2-D-SWE measurements were obtained at different depths (3, 5 and 7 cm), with different pre-load forces (4, 7 and 10N and variable) and at 0, 2 and 4cm off the central axis of the transducer. A single, blinded pathologist staged fibrosis using the METAVIR system (F0–F4). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was charted to differentiate significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2). Depth was the only factor found to influence ARFI-derived values; no acquisition factors were found to affect 2-D-SWE SWS values. ARFI and 2-D-SWE for diagnosis of significant fibrosis at a depth of 7cm along the central axis had good diagnostic performance (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.92 and 0.82, respectively), comparable to that of transient elastography. Further investigation of this finding will likely be of interest.
Geometric Processing: Active Sensor Modeling and Calibration (SAR)
 In this article, we discuss the basic concepts behind the localization of targets using active microwave sensors. In particular, we use the phase delay of the received radar signal as the key interpreting factor to describe the capability of such sensors to localize targets in 1D (Radar) 2D (SAR), and 3D (SAR Interferometry).
Revamp energy efficiency in Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks using Optimized Radio Energy Algorithm (OREA) and Power-Aware Distance Source Routing protocol
 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often used to monitor the physical world. By using sensor nodes, various types of environmental conditions can be sensed and also it can communicate with the sensed data via wireless communication. The sensor nodes are provided with a battery, and the reduction of the power consumption may lead to the prolonged anticipation of a lifetime of sensor nodes. Researchers worked on sensor nodes to gain energy efficiency and increase its lifetime. Reliable and effective communication among nodes routing algorithms is often used for WSNs. The important objective of routing algorithms is energy saving. Clustering algorithm improves energy efficiency in Homogeneous WSNs. The clustering technique identifies the shortest path, and it is used for cluster head selection. To dissipate energy efficiently, Optimized Radio Energy Algorithm (OREA) is used. Power-Aware Distance Source Routing (PADSR) clustering algorithm has been proposed for increasing Network lifetime of WSNs. Energy consumption and data quality are balanced by Quality of Service based routing protocols. Power-Aware Distance Source Routing (PADSR) decides performance evaluation of Quality of Service.
Performance assessment of factory and field calibrations for electromagnetic sensors in a loam soil
 Accurate continuous measurements of temperature (T), apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), apparent dielectric permittivity (εra), and volumetric water content (θv) are extremely valuable to irrigation management and other agronomic decisions. The performance of eight electromagnetic (EM) sensors (TDR315, CS655, HydraProbe2, 5TE, EC5, CS616, Field Connect, AquaCheck), were analyzed through a field study in a loam soil. T, ECa, and εra were compared in reference to overall average among all sensors, and θv in reference to a neutron moisture meter (NMM). The reported T and ECa difference among the sensors were within 1 °C and 1 dS m−1, respectively, at 0.15 and 0.76 m depths. Among the single-sensor probes, the range of depth-combined (0.15 and 0.76 m) RMSD for factory calibration varied from 0.039 m3 m−3 (5TE) to 0.157 m3 m−3 (CS616). In comparison to single-sensor probes, RMSD of Field Connect at combined depths (0.30 and 0.51 m) was moderate (0.083 m3 m−3), and RMSD of AquaCheck at combined depths (0.30 and 0.61 m) was high (0.163 m3 m−3). Regression calibrations improved θv accuracy substantially beyond factory calibrations, as RMSD of the evaluated sensors except Field Connect was below 0.025 m3 m−3 using regression calibrations. The betterment in θv accuracy gained by using offset calibrations was smaller and less consistent than the improvements gained by using regression calibrations. The lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for mean RMSD of most sensors were below 0.02 and 0.04 m3 m−3, respectively, when using depth-specific offset calibrations. The relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this study is encouraging and may signal new opportunities. Because much of the uncertainty in sensor-reported θv for the sensors under evaluation was systematic, future work should aim to develop universal calibrations or facilitate site-specific calibrations.
Crustal model of the Southern Central Andes derived from ambient seismic noise Rayleigh-wave tomography
 The distribution and the interconnection of magmatic bodies beneath volcanic arcs is key to asses volcanic hazard and eruptive processes taking place at convergent margins. We use ambient seismic noise Rayleigh-wave tomography to investigate the three-dimensional shear-wave crustal velocity structure of the Southern Central Andes between latitudes 33°S and 38°S (for the upper 30 km). We investigate the occurrence of magmatic reservoirs in the upper crust and show how their geometry is affected by local tectonics. The first prominent feature to be observed is the shear-wave velocity contrast between the volcanic arc and the faster fore-arc region. We further identify areas of low shear-wave velocity from 3 km to 10 km depth beneath the volcanic arc, striking N-S, that we interpret as zones of fluid-rich crust, possibly characterised by confined regions of partial melts. Our results allow us to derive a model for the crustal structure of the Southern Central Andes. We propose that partial melts, marked by lower shear-wave velocity anomalies, are connected to shallower structural levels and reservoirs by brittle regions where dikes and exsolved fluids may propagate.
A fluorescent coagulation assay for thrombin using a fibre optic evanescent wave sensor
 A fibre optic evanescent wave sensor is used for the rapid detection of thrombin. Coagulation of solution phase fluorescently labelled fibrinogen to unlabelled fibrinogen bound to the surface of the fibre optic is observed in real time by the evanescent wave sensor. Thrombin concentrations down to 0.01 NIH ml−1 are detectable within 5 min. The potential application of this technique for rapid amplified immunosensing is discussed.
Servo speed control of travelling-wave ultrasonic motor using digital signal processor
 In this study a novel servo speed control system for travelling-wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM) has been presented. A drive system has been built based on two-phase high-frequency inverter using mechanical resonant frequency of the ultrasonic motor. The TMS320F243 digital signal processor (DSP) is adapted to ultrasonic motor drive system. The speed control of ultrasonic motor has been implemented with driving frequency in the range of 41.3–43.3 kHz. The improved speed characteristics realised by the proposed drive and control system have been demonstrated and validated by experiments.
Assessment of rock-bit interaction and drilling performance using elastic waves propagated by the drilling system
 A novel passive Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (pVARD) tool was designed and tested to improve drilling performance or rate of penetration (ROP) both in laboratory and field trials. This paper focuses on characterizing drilling performance by means of seismic while drilling (SWD) method and bit vibration analysis. The field scale pVARD tool was applied in drill-off test (DOT) with an array of geophones (1C) spread along drill site. Rotary drilling using a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit was conducted and bit-rock interaction acted as the seismic source for reverse vertical seismic profile (RVSP). The rig waves were selected for characterizing drilling performance due to limited body waves observed during the experiment. The frequency spectra of the rig waves were determined which provided two effective seismic parameters: rig wave amplitude and frequency bandwidth for drilling performance analysis. These spectrums varied in response to variation in drilling conditions, i.e. weight-on-bit (WOB), pVARD tool use and configuration, and rock type. Bit vibration was assessed by means of vibration accelerations measured with a downhole SensorSub. The whole available data used for characterizing drilling performance included WOB, bit vibration accelerations, seismic wave amplitude and frequency bandwidth and rock type. Three groups of DOT tests were conducted: 1) conventional drilling in red shale, 2) pVARD drilling and conventional drilling in red shale, and 3) pVARD drilling and conventional drilling in grey shale. Analysis of the data shows that the seismic wave amplitude and frequency bandwidth decreased with increase of drilling performance. This is explained as more energy being partitioned for improved drilling performance with less energy partitioned to longitudinal wave and rig-ground motion. This phenomenon existed for both conventional drilling and pVARD tool drilling, independent of rock type. For comparable WOB, seismic wave amplitude and frequency bandwidth varied in response to drilling with or without pVARD tool, from which the pVARD tool mechanism was further investigated.
Dispersion of ultrasonic guided surface wave by honeycomb in early-aged concrete
 A pair of 50 kHz P-wave ultrasonic sensors was used in this research to study the effects of concrete containing honeycomb on ultrasonic guided surface wave propagation shortly after the initial few hours of mixing and after 28 days. Honeycomb was made inside the 100 mm thick concrete specimens by adjusting dosage of superplasticizer. The pair of sensors were accommodated 100 mm apart from each other, at the soffit and on the same side of the formwork. The ultrasonic guided surface wave signals were continuously measured and post-processed by short time Fourier transform (STFT) to evaluate the frequency spectra along the time axis. Over the ultrasonic time window, the frequency spectra were very dispersed for the specimens with honeycombs. The results suggested that during the early hydration of concrete, the added water filled the honeycombs and led to incoherent surface wave that significantly dispersed the frequency spectra. It is because the size of the honeycomb is in the same order as the wavelength the scattered surface wave. With this method, the presence of honeycomb immediately after casting of concrete can be detected non-destructively.
Mechanical sensors based on surface acoustic waves
 A survey is given of SAW sensor systems. Three categories of sensors are defined as transit-time, resonator and chirp-type devices and each category is subdivided into active and passive signal-processing systems. In these, the mechanical change of the SAW device is evaluated by difference measurements of the transit time, phase or resonance frequency, which are described quantitatively. To show the high resolution of active sensor systems, an electronic spirit level (based on SAW resonators) is described. New SAW chirp sensors allow the dispersive interdigital transducer or reflector geometry to be adjusted to the sensor system resolution and measurement range. In passive systems the sensor device is connected to an antenna. The SAW is excited by an interrogating radio impulse. After a SAW transit time, the sensor radiates back to the interrogator an impulse containing the sensor's information. The time and frequency response of all sensor categories and the possibilities of temperature compensation are discussed.
Three-dimensional analytical solution of acoustic emission source location for cuboid monitoring network without pre-measured wave velocity
 To find analytical solutions of nonlinear systems for locating the acoustic emission/microseismic(AE/MS) source without knowing the wave velocity of structures, the sensor location coordinates were simplified as a cuboid monitoring network. Different locations of sensors on upper and lower surfaces were considered and used to establish nonlinear equations. Based on the proposed functions of time difference of arrivals, the analytical solutions were obtained using five sensors under three networks. The proposed analytical solutions were validated using authentic data of numerical tests and experiments. The results show that located results are consistent with authentic data, and the outstanding characteristics of the new solution are that the solved process is not influenced by the wave velocity knowledge and iterated algorithms.
Linear bi-layer humidity sensor with tunable response using combinations of molybdenum carbide with polymers
 A high performance humidity sensor for environmental and health monitoring has been fabricated using various combinations of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) with polyacrylamide (PAM) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The humidity sensing properties of pure Mo2C were compared with those of its composites with PAM and PVA. The response curves and working principle were investigated and novel bi-layered sensors were then fabricated to achieve highly linear and stable response for a wide range of humidity sensing (0% RH to 90% RH). The sensors having a bi-layer combination of Mo2C with PAM give a linear response with a sensitivity of 775 Ω/%RH and excellent repeatability. The working mechanism of the sensors allow them to be used with frequency response conversion read-out circuits and the results ascertain their linear and stable behavior. The response-time and recovery-time of the sensors were measured that gave average values of ∼1 s and ∼2.5 s respectively for the composites and ∼1.8 s and 2.3 s for the bi-layer configuration. The sensors are aimed to replace low performance complex and expensive sensors in the market for environmental and health monitoring applications.
Magnetic field sensing using evanescent waves in the Kretschmann configuration
 To verify the feasibility of magnetic field sensing based on the interaction between evanescent waves and magnetic thin films, we have investigated the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect of Co thin films with various thicknesses in the Kretschmann attenuated total reflection configuration. Because of the influence of the glass magneto-optical Faraday rotation under a polar magnetic field, a multi-step experimental method has been applied to measure the intrinsic magneto-optical Kerr rotations of the thin Co films as a function of the angle of incidence. The significant effects of the angle of incidence, the incident light polarization state and the film thickness on the polar Kerr rotations of magnetic thin films in the Kretschmann configuration have been clearly shown in our experiments. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the interaction between the evanescent wave and the magnetic thin film is the main source of the observed magneto-optical activity. On the basis of these results, we discuss the practicalities of the development of a magnetic field sensor based on an evanescent wave penetrating into the magnetic thin film in the Kretschmann configuration, which is a simple structure that is compatible with both optical fibers and integrated optical waveguides.
Characterization of steel-concrete interface bonding conditions using attenuation characteristics of guided waves
 This paper presents an air-coupled ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation approach based on the attenuation characteristics of guided waves to characterize interface bonding conditions of steel-clad concrete structures. Analytical guided wave modal solutions for various interface bonding conditions are obtained using the global matrix technique. The analytical results indicate that attenuation behavior of the fundamental symmetric (S0) guided wave mode is sensitive to interface bonding condition. A signal processing scheme is proposed to extract a dimensionless damage index, the normalized S0 mode magnitude, which reflects the attenuation behavior of the S0 mode. A series of numerical simulations are performed to verify the utility of the parameter to characterize interface bond condition. The feasibility of the testing approach is then established by experiments on steel-clad concrete specimens with different interface bonding conditions. The numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that interface bonding conditions of steel-clad concrete structures can be quantitatively evaluated using the proposed approach.
Linear humidity sensor fabrication using bi-layered active region of transition metal carbide and polymer thin films
 A linear humidity sensor based on bi-layered sensing area using exfoliated chromium carbide (Cr3C2) and polyacrylamide (PAM) thin films has been fabricated through all printed methods. Transition metal carbides have unique properties that can be applied in various gas sensing applications. In this work, different combinations of Cr3C2 with two polymers have been used to fabricate high performance linear humidity sensors. Cr3C2 was processed using wet grinding exfoliation to achieve flakes and small particles of the material. Based on the working principle and sensing results of the single layered sensors, a novel bi-layered structure was proposed and fabricated with stable linear response and good sensitivity. The sensors are capable of measuring percentage relative humidity accurately in range of 0% RH to 90% RH with an absolute change of 660 Ω/%RH and fast response and recovery times of 1 s and 1.9 s respectively. The sensors can also work with simple frequency based read-out circuit with a highly linear and stable response. The fabricated sensors are cheap, easy to fabricate, and are ideal to be used in high end environmental and health monitoring applications.
Reducing the effect of wave dispersion in a timber pole based on transversely isotropic material modelling
 Round timbers are used for telecommunication and power distribution networks, jetties, piles, short span bridges etc. To assess the condition of these cylindrical shape timber structures, bulk and elementary wave theory are usually used. Even though guided wave can represents the actual wave behaviour, a great deal complexity exists to model stress wave propagation within an orthotropic media, such as timber. In this paper, timber is modelled as transversely isotropic material without compromising the accuracy to a great extent. Dispersion curves and mode shapes are used to propose an experimental set up in terms of the input frequency and bandwidth of the signal, the orientation of the sensor and the distance between the sensors in order to reduce the effect of the dispersion in the output signal. Some example based on the simulated signal is also discussed to evaluate the proposed experimental set up.

A novel acoustic method of partial discharge allocation considering structure-borne waves
 For partial discharge, PD, allocating utilizing acoustic emission, AE, sensors, the arrival time of acoustic waves to the sensors forms the calculation basics, therefore, it is crucial that distance calculations are based on direct acoustic path. Considering structure-borne waves of higher speed, this would imply an incorrect distance between the source and sensor, because, AE signals of indirect path me be considered as AE signals of direct path. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm has been developed to consider the possible indirect paths. By comparing the time taken in each path of propagation, to reach the specified sensor location, the indirect path of shortest time for AE signal is determined. For experimental verification, a test oil chamber has been fabricated. PD signals are generated at different points inside the tank. The estimation results of algorithm have been compared with results of classic Time Difference of Arrivals method, TDOA. The proposed method considerably increases the PD allocation precision.
Structural Health Monitoring and Propagation of Lamb Waves to Identification of Crack
 The paper presents the Structural health monitoring and the propagation of lamb wave and application to crack identification. The use of lamb waves or plate waves for crack detection is effective due to their long propagation range. Lamb waves are guided waves that can be generated in materials having thickness of the order of a few wavelengths Infinite number of modes are associated with a given plate wave problem. Lamb waves propagate through the thickness of the plate[1], and have complex vibrational patterns. The propagation of lamb waves depends on: operating frequency, material thickness, and density and elastic properties of the material. Different modes occur when the frequency and wave entry angle is varied. The basic modes are Symmetric (S) and Antisymmetric (A) modes. In Symmetric mode, the wave appears to be stretching and compressing the plate in wave motion direction. This mode can be efficiently produced when the exciting force is parallel to the plate. Antisymmetric (A) mode of the lamb waves is also known as flexural mode. Here most of the particle vibration takes place perpendicular to the plate.
The Wave-Matching Boundary Integral Equation — An energy approach to Galerkin BEM for acoustic wave propagation problems
 In this paper, a new Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) is proposed for solution of the scalar Helmholtz equation. Applications include acoustic scattering problems, as occur in room acoustics and outdoor and underwater sound propagation. It draws together ideas from the study of time-harmonic and transient BIEs and spatial audio sensing and rendering, to produce an energy-inspired Galerkin BEM that is intended for use with oscillatory basis functions. Pivotal is the idea that waves at a boundary may be decomposed into incoming and outgoing components. When written in its admittance form, it can be thought of setting the Burton–Miller coupling parameter differently for each basis function based on its oscillation; this is a discrete form of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. It is also naturally expressed in a reflectance form, which can be solved by matrix inversion or by marching on in reflection order. Consideration of this leads to an orthogonality relation between the incoming and outgoing waves, which makes the scheme immune to interior cavity eigenmodes. Moreover, the scheme is seen to have two remarkable properties when solution is performed over an entire obstacle: (i) it has a condition number of 1 for all positive-real wavenumber k on any closed geometry when a specific choice of cylindrical basis functions are used; (ii) when modelling two domains separated by a barrier domain, the two problems are numerical uncoupled when plane wave basis functions are used — this is the case in reality but is not achieved by any other BIE representation that the authors are aware of. Normalisation and envelope functions, as would be required to build a Partition-of-Unity or Hybrid-Numerical-Asymptotic scheme, are introduced and the above properties are seen to become approximate. The modified scheme is applied successfully to a cylinder test case: accuracy of the solution is maintained and the BIE is still immune to interior cavity eigenmodes, gives similar conditioning to the Burton–Miller method and iterative solution is stable. It is seen that for this test case the majority of values in the interaction matrices are extremely small and may be set to zero without affecting conditioning or accuracy, thus the linear system become sparse - a property uncommon in BEM formulations.
Prediction of wave-induced loads on ships: Progress and challenges
 The aim of this paper is to critically assess the methods used for the evaluation of wave-induced loads on ships examining analytical, numerical and experimental approaches. The paper focuses on conventional ocean going vessels and loads originating from steady state and transient excitations, namely slamming, sloshing and green water, for the latter, and including extreme or rogue waves, as well as the more occasional loads following damage. The advantages and disadvantages of the relatively simpler potential flow approaches against the more time consuming CFD methods are discussed with reference to accuracy, modeling nonlinear effects, ease of modeling and of coupling with structural assessment procedures, suitability for long term response prediction and suitability for integration within design and operational decision making. The paper also assesses the uncertainties involved in predicting wave-induced loads and the probabilistic approaches used for the evaluation of long term response and fatigue analysis. The current design practice is reviewed and the role of numerical prediction methods within the classification framework and goal based design approach discussed. Finally the suitability of current developments in prediction methods to meet the needs of the industry and future challenges is assessed.
Time reversal of a high frequency signal based on time-varying guided wave system
 A full-electronic method to realize time reversal of electromagnetic (EM) signal by using analog signal processing (ASP) technique is reported in this paper. A time-varying guided wave system, based on a transmission line with periodically loaded microwave switches, is described and discussed theoretically, analytically and experimentally. Examinations on a prototype demonstrator show that an amplitude-modulated pulse signal can be time reversed effectively, where the pulse has a time duration of 7 ns and the amplitude-modulated carrier is 3.5 GHz.
Dynamic thermal sensor for biofilm monitoring
 A novel sensor principle to continuously monitor biofilm formation by Enterococcus faecalis is presented. The sensor consists of a small heater and a temperature probe (thermistor); both are located on a thermally insulating, silicon nitride membrane. Biofilm is allowed to develop in M17-medium at 37 °C on the surface of the membrane. Electrical current applied to the heater produces a steady sinusoidal power signal at 40 Hz. The resulting temperature oscillations are captured by the temperature probe. Their amplitude and phase shift are influenced by the thickness and composition of the biofilm. Results show that the sensor system is able to monitor the evolution of biofilms for large time frames (hours). It also features very stable baseline measurements that outperform other types of sensor systems. A proof-of-concept by means of an antibiotics-growth-inhibition test is achieved.
Wave power extraction of a heaving floating oscillating water column in a wave channel
 The performance evaluation of a wave energy converter in wave channel is influenced by the hydrodynamic effects caused by the near presence of the side walls. Since this phenomenon is not observed in the open ocean, it is important to assess the walls influence in the converter dynamics when analysing experimental results. This paper studies the dynamics and power extraction of an axisymmetric floating oscillating water column (OWC) device, the Spar-buoy OWC, using experimental data obtained in a wave channel. A two heaving body model (spar-buoy and OWC) based on linear forces is formulated in the frequency domain. Linear hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained from a boundary integral equation method. The presence of the channel side walls is simulated approximately by a periodic array of devices, and alternatively by two finite-length walls. Linearized drag forces are derived from small-scale model tests. Power extraction results are presented for regular and irregular waves. The numerical simulations show that the wall effect may amplify the power capture up to a maximum of 15% for regular waves and 10% for irregular wave conditions, for a channel-width-to-device-diameter ratio equal to 5.25.
Modeling and Distribution of Link Travel Times: An Analysis on Istanbul Freeways
 Travel times can be directly estimated by measurements including probe vehicles, Bluetooth detectors, and etc. Route and network wide travel times can be alternatively specified employing indirect estimation methods. These methods can be classified into two those are trajectory based and traffic flow model based. Considering the latter class, an approach to reconstruct travel times is to employ models commonly used in dynamic traffic assignment, where the travel time on a link is a treated as a function of the number of vehicles on the link. In the presented research, we concentrate on the reconstruction performance of two traffic flow models on freeway link/path travel times. A link performance function based macroscopic traffic flow model is employed and compared with a microscopic traffic flow model. Performances of selected methods are evaluated with the actual measurements on travel time. Actual travel times have been collected on weekdays by using a global positioning system (GPS) module equipped probe vehicle. Following reconstruction of link/path travel times employing macroscopic and microscopic models, an evaluation on the distribution of model calculations with the corresponding to GPS measurements presented.
Target detection using weather radars and electromagnetic vector sensors
 We propose a method to detect a target in a bistatic passive polarimetric radar network, with weather surveillance radar as our illuminator of opportunity (IO). We build our signal model using electromagnetic vector sensors (EMVS) as the receiver, which captures the reflections from a point-like target present in the scene of interest, surrounded with strong clutter. We develop a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector that is robust to inhomogeneous clutter. We also develop a maximum likelihood (ML) solution to extract the signal subspace from the received data contaminated by the clutter interference. We provide the exact distribution of the test statistic for the asymptotic case and evaluate its performance loss by considering a reduced set of data. The proposed GLRT method is a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector, which makes it robust against the inhomogeneous clutter. With the help of numerical results, we demonstrate the robustness and the limitations of our proposed method.
Vapor recognition with an integrated array of polymer-coated flexural plate wave sensors
 Preliminary testing of a prototype instrument employing an integrated array of six polymer-coated flexural plate wave (FPW) sensors and an adsorbent preconcentrator is described. Responses to thermally desorbed samples of individual organic solvent vapors and binary and ternary vapor mixtures are linear with concentration, and mixture responses are equivalent to the sums of the responses of the component vapors, which co-elute from the preconcentrator in most cases. Limits of detection as low as 0.3 ppm are achieved from a 60-s (34 cm3) air sample and peak widths at half-maximum range from 1 to 4 s. Tests at different flow rates suggest that the kinetics of vapor sorption in the sensor coating films may limit responses at higher flow rates, however, low data acquisition rates may also be contributory. Assessments of array performance using independent test data and Monte Carlo simulations with pattern recognition indicate that individual vapors and certain binary and ternary mixtures can be recognized/discriminated with very low error. More complex mixtures, and those containing homologous vapors, are problematic. This is the first report demonstrating multi-vapor analysis with an integrated FPW sensor array.
Three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity profiling of geotechnical sites using full-waveform inversion driven by field data
 We discuss the application of a recently developed full-waveform-inversion-based technique to the imaging of geotechnical sites using field-collected data. Specifically, we address the profiling of arbitrarily heterogeneous sites in terms of P- and S-wave velocities in three dimensions, using elastic waves as probing agents. We cast the problem of finding the spacial distribution of the elastic soil properties as an inverse medium problem, directly in the time domain, and use perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs) to account for the semi-infinite extent of the site under investigation. After briefly reviewing the theoretical and computational aspects of the employed technique, we focus on the characterization of the George E. Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation site in Garner Valley, California (NEES@UCSB). We compare the profiles obtained from our full-waveform-inversion-based methodology against the profiling obtained from the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method, and report agreement. In an attempt to validate our methodology, we also compare the recorded field data at select control sensors that were not used for the full-waveform inversion, against the response at the same sensors, computed based on the full-waveform-inverted profiles. We report very good agreement at the control sensors, which is a strong indicator of the correctness of the inverted profiles. Overall, the systematic framework discussed herein seems robust, general, practical, and promising for three-dimensional site characterization purposes.
Feedback control and Kalman Filtering of nonlinear wave dynamics
 The paper proposes a pointwise control method for the 1D nonlinear wave equation and a filtering approach for estimating the dynamics of such a system from measurements provided by a small number of sensors. It is shown that the numerical solution of the associated partial differential equation results into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. With the application of a diffeomorphism that is based on differential flatness theory it is shown that an equivalent description of the system in the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form is obtained. This transformation enables to obtain estimates about the state vector of the system through the application of the standard Kalman Filter recursion. For the local subsystems, into which the nonlinear wave equation is decomposed, it becomes possible to apply pointwise state estimation-based feedback control. The efficiency of the proposed filtering and control approach for nonlinear systems described by 1D partial differential equations of the wave type (e.g. sine- Gordon PDE) is confirmed through simulation experiments.
An analytical model of ground surface vibration due to axisymmetric wave motion in buried fluid-filled pipes
 The axisymmetric (n=0) fluid-borne (s=1) wave has been exploited with varying degrees of success in practical surveys for determining the location of buried pipes. Difficulties are sometimes encountered in interpreting ground surface vibration data, whilst attempting to locate the pipes, due to the occurrence of abrupt changes in the phase response over the usable frequency range. Based on a wave propagation model developed recently, this paper presents an analytical model for predicting the ground surface displacements resulting from the radiated elastic waves in the soil medium. Two representative soils have been specifically considered, where the s=1 wave in the pipe will leak shear waves into the soil, but may or may not leak compressional waves. In each of these cases, numerical simulations are presented to predict the ground surface displacements. The model is used to demonstrate how, when both compressional and shear waves are radiated, they can interfere such that abrupt phase changes occur at the frequencies coincident with magnitude minima in the ground surface displacements; when only shear waves are radiated, such interference does not occur. Furthermore, for sandy soil, it is found that the horizontal displacement is dominated by the radiated shear wavenumber component whereas the vertical displacement is controlled by the radiated compressional wavenumber component. Using the analytical model, theoretical predictions of ground surface displacements are compared with experimental data from a dedicated MDPE pipe rig.
Lateral variation in crustal and mantle structure in Bay of Bengal based on surface wave data
 Surface waves generated by earthquakes that occurred near Sumatra, Andaman-Nicobar Island chain and Sunda arc are used to estimate crustal and upper mantle S wave velocity structure of Bay of Bengal. Records of these seismic events at various stations located along the eastern coast of India and a few stations in the north eastern part of India are selected for such analysis. These stations lie within regional distance of the selected earthquakes. The selected events are shallow focused with magnitude greater than 5.5. Data of 65, 37, 36, 53 and 36 events recorded at Shillong, Bokaro, Visakhapatnam, Chennai and Trivandrum stations respectively are used for this purpose. The ray paths from the earthquake source to the recording stations cover different parts of the Bay of Bengal. Multiple Filtering Technique (MFT) is applied to compute the group velocities of surface waves from the available data. The dispersion curves thus obtained for this data set are within the period range of 15–120 s. Joint inversion of Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity is carried out to obtain the subsurface information in terms of variation of S wave velocity with depth. The estimated S wave velocity at a given depth and layer thickness can be considered to be an average value for the entire path covered by the corresponding ray paths. However, we observe variation in the value of S wave velocity and layer thickness from data recorded at different stations, indicating lateral variation in these two parameters. Thick deposition of sediments is observed along the paths followed by surface waves to Shillong and Bokaro stations. Sediment thickness keeps on decreasing as the surface wave paths move further south. Based on velocity variation the sedimentary layer is further divided in to three parts; on top lay unconsolidated sediment, underlain by consolidated sediment. Below this lies a layer which we consider as meta-sediments. The thickness and velocity of these layers decrease from north to south. The crustal material has higher velocity at the southern part compared to that at the northern part of Bay of Bengal indicating that it changes from more oceanic type in the southern part of the Bay to more continental type to its north. Both Moho and lithosphere − asthenosphere boundary (LAB) dips gently towards north. Thicknesses of both lithosphere and asthenosphere also increase in the same direction. The mantle structure shows complex variation from south to north indicating possible effect of repeated changes in type of tectonic activity in the Bay of Bengal.
Physical scale model testing of a flexible membrane wave energy converter: Videogrammetric analysis of membrane operation
 In small-scale testing of wave energy converters (WECs), a key focus is on characterising the interdependent relationship between the primary converter and simulated power take-off system. If primary conversion is via the deformation of a flexible material, this task often requires non-contact measurement. In this paper, we introduce the development of an underwater non-contact measurement technique called videogrammetry, and its novel application to characterise the primary converter operation of a flexible membrane WEC. The work was part of Bombora Wave Power’s concept validation wave tank tests at 1:15 scale. Details of the WEC and how it works is followed by an in depth description on applying underwater videogrammetry. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of membrane operation in a regular wave case is provided and discussed in terms of absorbed energy and power production. Two data sets are compared in this analysis. One data set is from videogrammetry and the other is airflow measurement data (airflow induced in the system due to membrane deformation converts wave energy to mechanical energy). This comparison quantifies the accuracy of videogrammetry, and also serves to verify airflow measurements that were used to determine performance indicators of the WEC throughout the entire test campaign. The results compare reasonably well. Sources of uncertainty for videogrammetry are discussed and improvements suggested. Preliminary best practices for applying videogrammetry in wave energy experiments are provided.
Energy dissipation during impacts of spheres on plates: Investigation of developing elastic flexural waves
 The model of Zener describing the energy dissipation during an impact process due to a simple flexural wave has been modified by dividing the impact process into three phases. For this purpose, crucial results from the model of Koller have been used which describes the same energy dissipation exclusively with longitudinal and transversal waves. The resulting modified model represents a comprehensive analytical alternative to the model of Koller showing a direct relation to the model of Hunter. The modified model approximates the experimental values well and describes them better than the original model of Zener or the model of Koller. For the comprehensive investigation of the influence of the (developing) flexural wave, elastic as well as elastic–plastic materials have been used as model materials for the experiments.
Measuring ocean waves in sea ice using SAR imagery: A quasi-deterministic approach evaluated with Sentinel-1 and in situ data
 Measurements of wave heights in marginal ice zones are limited to very few in situ data. Here we revisit the linear and quasilinear theories of Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging of waves in the particular case of waves in sea ice. Instead of only working with spectra, we have developed an iterative nonlinear algorithm to estimate phase-resolved deterministic maps of wave-induced orbital velocities, from which elevation spectra can be derived. Application of this algorithm to Sentinel 1A wave mode images in the Southern Ocean shows that it produces reasonable results for swells in all directions except when they propagate at a few degrees off the range direction. The estimate of wave parameters is expected to work best when the shortest wave components, those which cause a pixel displacement of the order of the dominant wavelength in azimuth, can be neglected. Otherwise short waves produce a blurring of the image, increasing exponentially with the azimuthal wavenumber and reducing the estimated wave amplitude. Given the expected spatial attenuation of waves in ice-covered regions, our deterministic method should apply beyond a few tens of kilometers in the ice, without any correction for short wave effects. In situ data collected around the ice edge as part of the 2015 SeaState DRI cruise in the Beaufort confirm the progressive image blurring caused by such short waves, and the apparent reduction in the wave modulation. When short waves propagate from the open ocean towards the ice, this blurring can produce an unrealistic apparent increase of wave height, from the open ocean up to a few tens of kilometers inside the ice.
Interaction between gas flow and a Lamb waves based microsensor
 The interaction between the gas flow and Lamb waves is investigated in this paper. Depending on the fact that the phase velocity is higher or lower than the gas sound velocity, we will get evanescent waves (EW) or leaky Lamb waves (LLW) in the gas along the solid–gas interface. In the LLW case, experiments showed that gas flow had not evident effects on Lamb waves’ propagations. In the EW case, the interaction between the gas flow and the Lamb waves was observed clearly when the Lamb wave phase velocity is close to the gas sound velocity. This interaction is related with the gas flow velocity profile within the boundary layer. The experimental results show that this sensor is very promising for many experiments involving gas flows such in wind tunnels, micro channels characterization, and can lead to multi-parameters measurements.
Numerical investigation of Rayleigh waves in layered composite piezoelectric structures using the SIGA-PML approach
 Existence of surface acoustic waves(SAW) on a piezoelectric layer with the half-infinite elastic layer is investigated. This structure belongs to an open waveguide with the unbounded boundary in the transverse direction. Except for trapped modes, leaky modes have often been considered in SAW applications, which requires waves of low attenuation in order to maximize the propagation distance. Therefore, we develop an another formulation of piezoelectric layer structures for the computation of trapped and leaky modes in open waveguides. This method combines the so-called semi-analytical isogeometric analysis and a perfectly matched layer technique (SIGA-PML). The comparison between semi-analytical finite element (SAFE-PML) and SIGA-PML is given, in order to show the effective and accuracy of SIGA-PML. Finally, we analyze propagation properties of Rayleigh waves and discuss the impact of the thickness of Cu films on the dispersive relationships.
Low-frequency Inductive Power Transmission for Piezo-Wafer-Active-Sensors in the Structural Health Monitoring of Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer
 Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using surface applied or embedded Piezo-Wafer-Active-Sensors (PWAS) to generate and measure Lamb-waves on fiber-reinforced materials is the main target of this study. Wireless power transmission was achieved implementing the principle of inductive coils. The characteristics of the material where the coil system is located have a direct impact on the strength of the magnetic-field. Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is known to behave as a conductor and depending on their frequency; radio waves can be shielded by such materials. Therefore, a new interest to evaluate the direct operation of PWAS via inductive coils at the low-frequency range, where the effect is lower, has been raised. A low-frequency wireless SHM system is achieved by combining the PWAS, in this case bonded to the surface, with an inductive coil in resonance. A CFRP plate with surface bonded PWAS was prepared in order to evaluate the power transmission; not only between antenna coils but also the energy necessary to stimulate the PWAS was measured. To enable this direct excitation of the PWAS, the same frequency which is provided on the primary side is used on the secondary side. Typical values of a PWAS are obtained form an electrical model based on its measured impedance.
Reliability and O&M sensitivity analysis as a consequence of site specific characteristics for wave energy converters
 Estimates for lifetime costs of wave energy arrays are difficult to obtain due to the uncertainty surrounding weather windows and failure rates for wave energy converters (WECs). An operations & maintenance (O&M) simulation tool has been used to assess the sensitivity of WEC failure rates on the profitability of a wave farm, with the Pelamis P2 device used as a case study. Two offshore wave energy sites in the UK have been characterised and presented in terms of accessibility for marine operations and power generation. It was found that a wave farm at one site would incur higher costs due to vessels having to wait longer for suitable weather windows. This was balanced by higher generated revenue, showing how the tool can be used to support strategic planning and site selection. The results identify the sensitivity to failure rate estimations for different components, helping target future work to reduce uncertainties and costs. The results highlight the need for WEC developers to collaborate closely with component manufacturers in order to design the best device possible for the challenging marine environment. Collaboration enables more realistic failure rate estimates to be obtained, leading to better understanding of the operational costs for commercial wave energy farms.
Surface acoustic wave electronic tongue for robust analysis of sensory components
 A robust approach is presented here for the rapid identification of the different human tastes. Novel two-port resonator-based shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensors have been designed that operate on a purely physical detection principle. The devices were fabricated on a 3″ 36° YX LiTaO3 wafer and found to resonate at the designed wireless ISM frequency of 434 MHz. They have been also designed to be low loss when operated in aqueous media and without the need for taste-specific coatings. The successful identification of six different tastes was achieved: not only the four common tastes of saltiness, sweetness, sourness, and bitterness but also solutions representing the umami and metallic tastes. 100% separation between samples of the same taste class (e.g. caffeine and quinine hydrochloride of the bitter class) was also demonstrated, as well as a detection and classification of samples of the same substance with different concentrations. Furthermore, the identification of binary taste mixtures and separating them from original component solutions was investigated and confirmed experimentally. We believe that the sensor's response to the mixtures can be described by a simple model based upon combinations of their characteristic physical properties; amongst which electrical conductivity, density and viscosity appear to have the most significant influence. Uncoated taste sensors offer the potential for robust liquid sensors that can be manufactured in volume at low unit cost.
Temperature sensor based on dielectric optical microresonator
 An optical temperature sensor has been presented based on Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) dielectric microresonator. The effect of Transverse Electric (TE) wave propagation in dielectric micro-spheres presented has been for optical resonances based on WGM. TE waves are characterized both theoretically and experimentally for large size parameter of the micro-spheres. A theoretical model has been developed based on asymptotic approach. The theoretical development is mathematically robust and significantly less complicated than existing approaches presented in the literature. The quality factor of experimental resonance spectra observed in the laboratory is calculated approximately in the order of 104 which is sensitive enough to detect micro or nano level temperature changes in the surrounding medium. The sensitivity of the Morphology Dependent Resonance (MDR) temperature sensor is wavelength change of 10−9 m for one degree centigrade change in temperature. This sensor could potentially be used for nano technology, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, and biomedical applications.
Study of guided wave propagation on a plate between two solid bodies with imperfect contact conditions
 In this work, fundamental symmetric Lamb wave S0 mode is characterized in terms of its velocity variation as function of the interfacial conditions between solid bodies in contact. Imperfect contact conditions are numerically and experimentally determined by using ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation parameters. For the study, an experimental system was used, formed by two solid aluminum rods (25.4 mm in diameter) axially loading a thin aluminum plate to control contact interfacial stiffness. The axially applied load on the aluminum plate was varied from 0 MPa to 10 MPa. Experimental Lamb wave signals were excited on the plate through two longitudinal contact transducers (1 MHz of central frequency) using a pitch-catch configuration. Numerical simulations of contact conditions and Lamb wave propagation were performed through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in commercial software, ANSYS 15®. Simulated Lamb wave signals were generated by means of a 5 cycles tone burst signals with different frequency values. Results indicate a velocity change in both, experimental and simulated Lamb wave signals as function of the applied load. Finally, a comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements was performed obtaining a good agreement.
Surface plasmon resonance based fiber optic sensor for the detection of cysteine using diosmin capped silver nanoparticles
 A simple green method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is described where diosmin acts as reducing and capping agent. Formation of diosmin capped silver nanoparticles (Dios-AgNPs) was characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, TEM, Raman imaging and FTIR analysis. Investigations on the biosensing of Dios-AgNPs among various amino acids showed excellent response towards cysteine. Further an SPR based fiber optic sensor for cysteine was fabricated and its sensitivity, selectivity and limit of detection were investigated and reported. The fiber optic sensor was developed by coating a thin film of silver over the unclad core of the fiber and then coated with Dios-AgNPs. The sensor has advantages of low cost of production, fast response, high selectivity and sensitivity. The sensor can be used for online monitoring and remote sensing applications.
IEEE 802.11p for cellular offloading in vehicular sensor networks
 The use of vehicles as sensors is a new paradigm to enable an efficient environment monitoring and an improved traffic management. In most cases, the sensed information must be collected at a remote control center and one of the most challenging aspects is the uplink acquisition of data from vehicles, which is presently performed through cellular networks. With the objective to offload cellular networks, in this paper we propose and discuss the adoption of the WAVE/IEEE 802.11p protocols, which represent the state of the art for short range vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications. More specifically, we discuss the system design and assess the cellular resource saving that can be obtained in urban scenarios through the deployment of WAVE/IEEE 802.11p devices on the vehicles and roadside units, evaluating the impact of the percentage of equipped vehicles, of the number of deployed road side units, and of the adopted routing protocol. Results, obtained through an integrated simulation platform taking both realistic vehicular environments and wireless network communication aspects into account, show that the deployment of few road side units and the use of low complexity routing protocols leads to a significant reduction of cellular resource occupation, even approaching 100% with a high density of equipped vehicles.
FE analysis and experimental evaluation of the performance of a travelling wave rotary motor driven by high power ultrasonic transducers
 Ultrasonic motors have been exploited mainly in low power and low duty cycle applications. In aerospace and automotive applications, there is also the need for motors able to provide high torque but employed at very low duty cycle. In this work numerical simulations and experimental measurements carried out on a high power ultrasonic motor are presented. The proposed motor is composed of a annular shaped stator and two light cone shaped rotors. The rotors are pressed in contact to the borders of the inner surface of the stator by means of an opportune pre-stress system. A travelling rotating wave is generated in the stator by two and four Bolted Langevin Transducers, opportunely placed on the lateral surface of the stator. Each transducer is designed to excite in the ring radial nonaxisymmetric modes. The effective generation of the travelling wave in the stator, with both two and four driving transducers, has been accurately simulated with a FEM software. A prototype of the motor has been constructed and experimentally characterized. Comparisons between simulation and measurements have shown a satisfactory agreement. The improvement of motor performances achieved by increasing the number of driving transducers is analyzed and discussed.
Void handling using Geo-Opportunistic Routing in underwater wireless sensor networks
 Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) consist of a group of acoustic sensor nodes that report the sensed information to the sink nodes at the surface level. The factors like multipath fading, path loss, Doppler spread, limited battery power, and high mobility void region cause UWSNs to become spatially variable. In this paper, the idea of Geography-based Opportunistic Routing (GOR) is applied to advance the packet towards the destination and to handle the void problem. The proposed design is termed as Void Handling using Geo-Opportunistic Routing (VHGOR). In executing so, a heuristic algorithm comprising two metrics, namely OREPP and NCD for optimal forwarder selection is proposed. Additionally, a void handling mechanism is also proposed that handles void in two ways. Quick hull algorithm that makes a convex hull assists to identify whether the void is convex or concave. When the node approaches a convex void, reconstruction of convex hull helps to determine an alternative way to resume the greedy forwarding if the node has neighbors within its proximity. Failure of convex void handling during communication void makes VHGOR switch to concave void handling (or) recovery mode to recover the packet from local maximum node and to route the packet to the destination. At the end of simulation, the proposed VHGOR results considerably improve the network performance when compared with the existing solutions, both in sparse and very dense networks.

Evaluation of vortex-induced vibration of a steel catenary riser in steady current and vessel motion-induced oscillatory current
 A large-scale model test of a truncated steel catenary riser (SCR) was performed in an ocean basin to investigate the riser responses under pure steady uniform current and pure vessel motions separately. Out-of-plane vortex-induced vibration (VIV) was confirmed to have occurred under both test conditions. A comparative analysis and discussion were carried out on selected cases in terms of out-of-plane VIV responses, VIV developing mechanisms and the fatigue damage contribution. Results indicate that both steady current-induced and vessel motion-induced VIV responses are dominated by strong travelling waves, but vessel motion-induced VIV responses are more ‘intermittent’ with respect to the response amplitude and frequency owing to its space- and time-varying shedding frequency. ‘Power-in’ regions are further estimated to understand the VIV developing mechanisms for both test conditions. Finally, fatigue damages are evaluated showing the damage by vessel motion-induced VIV is comparable and at the same level as uniform current-induced VIV, which highlights the great importance of vessel motion-induced VIV, which cannot be neglected in the design and analysis for SCR systems.
Feasibility of component state awareness of high strain rate events using fiber Bragg grating sensors
 Strategically located Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensors have been proposed as an in situ method to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for metallic and composite components. This paper presents a systematic study that investigates the viability of FBG Sensors under high strain rate loading by initially measuring 1D-strains in a compression Hopkinson bar experiment, followed by 2D full-field strain-tensor in impact and blast experiments on plates. Specifically, high strain rates from commercialized FBG Sensors are compared to traditional resistive and semi-conductor based strain gages under various levels of 1D high strain rate loading. In the projectile-plate impact experiments, full-field back-surface strain measured using FBG Sensor arrays are compared with that measured from 3D surface Digital Image Correlation (3D-sDIC) strain measuring technique. Finally, strains in welded steel plates subjected to high explosive discharge are monitored with mounted FBG Sensors on the back surface. From this study, potential improvements in the SNR of FBG Sensors are recommended, and the survivability of these sensors under more complex, dynamic loading is evaluated.
Practical issues related to the application of piezoelectric based wave propagation technique in monitoring of concrete curing
 Smart piezoelectric material, namely, the Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) has recently found its application in concrete curing and strength development monitoring using the wave propagation (WP) technique. Real-life application of this technique is sometimes questioned as various practical issues have not been attended. In this paper, a series of experimental studies are performed to investigate a range of practical issues related to the application of this technique, in an attempt to reduce the gap between laboratory studies and real-life applications. Issues such as the consistency of wave velocities and repeatability of the sensor’s electrical signatures, the optimum frequency of actuation, the effect of PZT transducer’s spacing and sizes, the waveform of actuation signatures, the effect of input voltage amplification, the effect of different surface roughness, the environmental effect and the effect of different types of coarse aggregates are experimentally studied. Results showed that 5-peaks sinusoidal tone burst actuated at 30 kHz or 120 kHz are preferred input voltage. Spacing of transducers should be approximately 90 mm. Smooth and even surface of the host structure is preferred for bonding. The WP technique is found to be reliable and its performance is consistent across different specimens up to a period of 365 days. It is also capable of differentiating the strength concrete with different types of coarse aggregate. Studies conducted in this paper provide basic understanding into various practical issues, which is expected to serve as guidelines to future development, design, optimization and commercialization of a more effective PZT based WP technique in monitoring of concrete curing.
Compensating effect of ultrasonic waves on retarding action of nanoparticles in drops liquid–liquid extraction
 The influence of ultrasonic waves on liquid–liquid extraction of circulating drops and in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles was investigated. Experiments were conducted in a column equipped with an ultrasound transducer. The frequency and intensity of received waves, measured by the hydrophone standard method, were 35.40 kHz and 0.37 mW/cm2, respectively. The recommended chemical system of cumene–isobutyric acid–water was used in which mass transfer resistance lies in the aqueous phase. Nanoparticles, within concentration range of (0.0003–0.0030) wt%, were added to the aqueous continuous phase. The presence of nanoparticles and ultrasonic waves provided no sensible change in drop size (within 2.49–4.17 mm) and measured terminal velocities were close to Grace model. However, presence of nanoparticles, caused mass transfer to decrease. This undesired effect was significantly diminished by using ultrasonic waves so that mass transfer coefficient increased from (73.0–178.2) to (130.2–240.2) µm/s, providing a 55.6% average enhancement. It is presumably due to disturbing the accumulated nanoparticles around the drops. The current innovative study highlights the fact that using ultrasonic waves is an interesting way to improve liquid–liquid extraction in the presence and absence of nanoparticles.
Control of temperature wave trains in periodically forced networks of catalytic reactors for methanol synthesis
 We study the stabilisation of travelling temperature wave trains in periodically forced networks of catalytic reactors where methanol synthesis takes place. Temperature wave train solutions reproduce the inter-stage cooling effect of multistage fixed bed reactors and are therefore particularly attractive in terms of methanol conversion. However, these solutions are generally stable within narrow operating windows and always coexist with solutions characterised by lower methanol conversion. We implement a feedback control strategy with the switching time as a manipulated variable to ensure the stability of temperature wave trains. The reaction front velocity is estimated during each cycle based on temperature measurements. This allows the switching time to be computed so that the reaction front does not cross a prescribed set-point position. Indications on how to place temperature sensors and to select the set-point and controller parameters are provided. Numerical simulations demonstrating the ability of the implemented control law to prevent the transition to undesired solutions in the presence of disturbances both in the operating regime and during start-up are reported.
Modeling of three-dimensional Lamb wave propagation excited by laser pulses
 As a type of broadband source of ultrasonic guided waves, laser pulses can be used to launch all modes of interests. In this paper, Lamb waves are excited by imposing heat flux mimicking the supply of the heat from laser pulses, and effects by defects on the received Lamb waves in a plate are investigated by means of the finite element method. In order to alleviate the heavy computational cost in solving the coupled finite element equations, a sub-regioning scheme is employed, and it reduces the computational cost significantly. A comparison of Lamb waves generated by unfocused and line-focused laser sources is conducted. To validate numerical simulations, the group velocity of A0 mode is calculated based on the received signal by using the wavelet transform. The result of A0 mode group velocity is compared with the solution of Rayleigh–Lamb equations, and close agreement is observed. Lamb waves in a plate with defects of different lengths are examined next. The out-of-plane displacement in the plate with a defect is compared with the displacement in the plate without defects, and the wavelet transform is used to determine the arrival times of Lamb waves traveling at the A0 mode group velocity. A strong correlation is observed between the extent of defects and the magnitude of wavelet coefficients.
Effects of water saturation on P-wave propagation in fractured coals: An experimental perspective
 Internal structure of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs can be evaluated through ultrasonic measurements. The compressional wave that propagates in a fractured coal reservoir may indicate the internal coal structure and fluid characteristics. The P-wave propagation was proposed to study the relations between petrophysical parameters (including water saturation, fractures, porosity and permeability) of coals and the P-wave velocity (Vp), using a KON-NM-4A ultrasonic velocity meter. In this study, the relations between Vps and water saturations were established: Type I is mainly controlled by capillary of developed seepage pores. The controlling factors on Type II and Type III are internal homogeneity of pores/fractures and developed micro-fractures, respectively. Micro-fractures density linearly correlates with the Vp due to the fracture volume and dispersion of P-wave; and micro-fractures of types C and D have a priority in Vp. For dry coals, no clear relation exists between porosity, permeability and the Vp. However, as for water-saturated coals, the correlation coefficients of porosity, permeability and Vp are slightly improved. The Vp of saturated coals could be predicted with the equation of Vp-saturated = 1.4952Vp-dry–26.742 m/s. The relation between petrophysical parameters of coals and Vp under various water saturations can be used to evaluate the internal structure in fractured coals. Therefore, these relations have significant implications for coalbed methane (CBM) exploration.
Pairwise graphical models for structural health monitoring with dense sensor arrays
 Through advances in sensor technology and development of camera-based measurement techniques, it has become affordable to obtain high spatial resolution data from structures. Although measured datasets become more informative by increasing the number of sensors, the spatial dependencies between sensor data are increased at the same time. Therefore, appropriate data analysis techniques are needed to handle the inference problem in presence of these dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses graphical models (GM) for considering the spatial dependencies between sensor measurements in dense sensor networks or arrays to improve damage localization accuracy in structural health monitoring (SHM) application. Because there are always unobserved damaged states in this application, the available information is insufficient for learning the GMs. To overcome this challenge, we propose an approximated model that uses the mutual information between sensor measurements to learn the GMs. The study is backed by experimental validation of the method on two test structures. The first is a three-story two-bay steel model structure that is instrumented by MEMS accelerometers. The second experimental setup consists of a plate structure and a video camera to measure the displacement field of the plate. Our results show that considering the spatial dependencies by the proposed algorithm can significantly improve damage localization accuracy.
Trapped modes and resonance wave transmission in a plate with a system of notches
 The paper deals with guided wave propagation and diffraction in an elastic plate with two and more parallel grooves (notches). It is a continuation of the preceding studies of a single-notch diffraction focused on the manifestation of the trapped mode and resonance transmission effects in the case of several obstacles. Those effects occur at the frequencies close to the nearly real scattering resonance poles, and the forms of wave localization near the notches are predetermined by the eigenforms associated with these poles. Therefore, the change of location of nearly real poles with additional notches and its dependence on their spacing are the issues of prime concern. The increase in number and assembling in groups of resonance poles and transmission peaks, which was known for multi-obstacle guides of other nature, have also been revealed and experimentally confirmed. The theoretical research is conducted on the basis of low-cost semi-analytical models, and the numerical simulation is experimentally validated through the laser Doppler vibrometry.
Damping of waves propagating over a muddy bottom in deep water: Experiment and theory
 Surprisingly, deep water waves in the ocean propagating over mud bottoms can attenuate if wave groups are formed. This is shown in wave tank experiments, where two superimposed short waves with slightly different frequencies were generated to create the wave groups. Associated with the wave groups are long bound second order waves, which can exert wave pressure on the mud bottom, dissipating energy. Attenuation coefficients were measured by using Prony's method for each wave component as a function of distance down the tank. We develop an analytic expression for the nonlinear interaction between the two waves in deep water propagating at arbitrary angles by using Stokes' theory to second order. Finally, we show that the attenuation can be explained by the rate of work at bottom done by the long bound wave using the visco-elastic model MacPherson (1980). The results show that the dissipation depends on the incident wave periods, the bottom pressure and the vertical velocity of the long bound wave at the bottom.
1.19 An Overview of Wave Propagation Techniques in Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composite Plates
 This chapter provides a qualitative overview of the broad field of wave propagation in composite plates, with focus on fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. A number of techniques based on mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves are discussed, that have been historically used to detect damage in composites.
Simulation of a two-stroke diesel engine for propulsion in waves
 Propulsion in waves is a complex physical process that involves interactions between a hull, a propeller, a shaft and a prime mover which is often a diesel engine. Among the relevant components, the diesel engine plays an important role in the overall system dynamics. Therefore, using a proper model for the diesel engine is essential to achieve the reasonable accuracy of the transient simulation of the entire system. In this paper, a simulation model of a propulsion system in waves is presented with emphasis on modeling a two-stroke marine diesel engine: the framework for building such a model and its mathematical descriptions. The models are validated against available measurement data, and a sensitivity analysis for the transient performance of the diesel engine is carried out. Finally, the results of the system simulations under various wave conditions are analyzed to understand the physical processes and compare the efficiency for different cases.
The effects of the multimodal real time information systems on the travel behaviour
 This paper aims at assessing the effects on travel behaviour of a multimodal real-time information navigator for smartphone, developed within the project Optimod’Lyon and launched in May 2015. To this end, a quali-quantitative approach was adopted, administering a questionnaire and organising focus groups before and after the test of the application, involving a stratified sample of 50 people living in the metropolitan area of Lyon. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used as the theoretical framework for the questionnaire design, investigating attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. To evaluate the behavioural change, data were analysed using parametric and non-parametric tests, factor analysis and binary logistic regression. The positive attitude towards Optimod’Lyon lessened over time. After the test, the use of the different travel modes remained stable, showing a consistency on the most used mode, on behavioural patterns and attitudes, strongly related to habits and to the frequency of the past behaviour.
Experimental methodology for turbocompressor in-duct noise evaluation based on beamforming wave decomposition
 An experimental methodology is proposed to assess the noise emission of centrifugal turbocompressors like those of automotive turbochargers. A step-by-step procedure is detailed, starting from the theoretical considerations of sound measurement in flow ducts and examining specific experimental setup guidelines and signal processing routines. Special care is taken regarding some limiting factors that adversely affect the measuring of sound intensity in ducts, namely calibration, sensor placement and frequency ranges and restrictions. In order to provide illustrative examples of the proposed techniques and results, the methodology has been applied to the acoustic evaluation of a small automotive turbocharger in a flow bench. Samples of raw pressure spectra, decomposed pressure waves, calibration results, accurate surge characterization and final compressor noise maps and estimated spectrograms are provided. The analysis of selected frequency bands successfully shows how different, known noise phenomena of particular interest such as mid-frequency “whoosh noise” and low-frequency surge onset are correlated with operating conditions of the turbocharger. Comparison against external inlet orifice intensity measurements shows good correlation and improvement with respect to alternative wave decomposition techniques.
Implantable accelerometer system for the determination of blood pressure using reflected wave transit time
 A sensor system for continuous monitoring of blood pressure using an acceleration sensor implanted on an artery using minimally invasive techniques is described. The sensor relies on measurement of the reflected wave transit time (RWTT). This implantable system is fabricated on a flexible substrate using 2 mm × 2 mm acceleration sensors and a telemetric unit for transmission of the data. In vivo experiments show that the RWTT can be reliably determined from arterial acceleration signals. RWTT and systolic blood pressure are shown to be strongly coupled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96, as determined from measurement of 1800 pulses with a mean deviation of the blood pressure of only 4.3%. The system was implanted in an animal and was able to telemetrically transmit acceleration plethysmographs with high quality out of the awake animal.
Sorting of tumour cells in a microfluidic device by multi-stage surface acoustic waves
 Detection of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of tumour metastasis and evaluation of therapeutic effect on prognosis. The low number of the CTCs, however, makes their isolation from the peripheral blood very difficult. In this paper, a microfluidic device has been developed, which consists of a pair of straight interdigital transducers (IDTs) and focused interdigital transducers (FIDTs), to separate tumour cells from red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood stream by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The standing SAWs (SSAW) generated by the straight IDTs enabled placing the CTCs and RBCs at the pressure nodes while the FIDTs generated the focused travelling pulsed SAWs (TSAWs) to push the CTCs away from the blood cells to achieve the isolation of CTCs. Using this mechanism, this device was capable of concentrating and separating 2 μm and 5 μm polystyrene particles and about 94.2% of particles with the diameter of 5 μm could be collected at the outlet. Moreover, 90% ± 2.4% of U87 glioma cells could be isolated from the RBCs when the cycle number of the TSAWs was 720 k. In the enrichment process, this microfluidic device totally relied on the SSAW without any additional assistance of the flow focusing. For the separation, unlike the bidirectional acoustic radiation force in SSAW, the unidirectional force generated by TSAWs consistently pushed the particles along the wave propagation, improving the sorting performance. This multi-stage device may provide an alternative method for sorting CTCs in a reliable and flexible manner.
Travel-time tomographic imaging: multi-frequency diffraction evaluation of a medium with a high-contrast inclusion
 This paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental parametric study for the interpretation of the multi-frequency P-wave travel-time tomographic inversion of high-contrast heterogeneous media. A wide range of wavelengths was selected to simulate diffraction propagation regimes where the straight-ray assumption has limited application. In the numerical study, parameters such as operating wavelengths, source–receiver directivity, and ray bending effects were considered to improve the quality of travel-time tomographic inversion by interpreting internal scales of material–wavelength interactions. In the experimental study, two cylindrical concrete specimens with high and low-density inclusions were tested and tomographic images were obtained using three different wavelengths. Numerical and experimental results indicate the importance of wavelengths and curved ray solutions in the inversion of high-quality tomographic images of media with high-contrast inclusions.
Stereo wave imaging from moving vessels: Practical use and applications
 Stereo wave imaging of the sea surface elevation has become an effective instrumentation to gather small- and medium-range 3-D wind wave data. Indeed, fruitful applications of stereo techniques have provided new insights into directional wave spectra, space–time distributions of wave maxima, and small-scale wave statistics. So far, however, stereo systems have been deployed mainly on fixed structures (e.g. oceanographic platforms or lighthouses) in order to simplify the installation and maintenance procedures. Nonetheless, advances in stereo calibration and processing suggest that stereo deployments are also feasible onboard moving vessels, thus broadening the impact of these observations on the study of wind waves. In this context, this study aims at discussing how the stereo processing designed to gather reliable wave data from fixed structures should be managed to operate on a moving structure. In particular, estimate of stereo cameras orientation and position with respect to the mean sea plane is of utmost importance. We discuss this aspect by using a synthetic sea state and stereo data collected during an oceanographic campaign onboard a research vessel. Results suggest that, without complementary data sources for ship motion compensation, the sea surface elevation field should include at least about sixteen spatial (2-D) waves to gather a robust estimate of the mean sea plane and consequently realistic wave parameters (e.g. the significant wave height). In this respect, our results provide also insight into the uncertainty of estimates in case of a limited number of 2-D waves is collected by the stereo system. Finally, applications of stereo wave imaging on a moving structure are discussed, with particular emphasis on the collection of space–time wave fields for assessment of numerical models and operational wave observation onboard vessels.
Investigation of wave propagation in piezoelectric helical waveguides with the spectral finite element method
 The dispersion behaviors of wave propagation in waveguides of piezoelectric helical structures are investigated. By using the tensor analysis in the helical curve coordinate, the general strain-displacement relationship of piezoelectric helix is firstly considered. This paper's formulation is based on the spectral finite element which just requires the discretization of the cross-section with high-order spectral elements. The eigenvalue matrix of the dispersion relationship between wavenumbers and frequencies is obtained. Numerical examples on PZT5A and Ba2NaNb5O15 helical waveguides of a wide range of lay angles are presented. The effects of the piezoelectric on the dispersive properties and the variation tendency of dispersion curves on helix angles are shown. The mechanism of mode separation in piezoelectric helical waveguides is further analyzed through studying waves structures of the flexural modes.
Structural health monitoring of bonded composite repairs – A critical comparison between ultrasonic Lamb wave approach and surface mounted crack sensor approach
 The effectiveness of the Lamb waves Acoustic-Ultrasound Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technique for the determination of the adhesive joint failure was evaluated and compared to that of another SHM technique: Surface Mountable Crack Sensor (SMCS). A commercially available Acoustic-Ultrasound system was used. The SMCS consists of a “hot spot” monitoring system based on a three-layer electrically insulating and conductive paint. An electrical signal is used as a boolean operator for the characterization of the passage of damage through the sensor and the underlying material. The coupons consisted of carbon fiber substrates with boron patches bonded to them. The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed. It has been demonstrated that the Lamb waves Acoustic-Ultrasound technique possesses the capability to identify and quantify damage in a bonded repair. The SMCS proved to be a successful SHM technique for the monitoring of the formation of a disbond at the edges of the patch. All results were validated using the C-Scan ultrasound method.
Pulse-echo ultrasonic measurements of compressibility coefficient of thick epoxy resin during the curing process
 A pulse-echo apparatus was developed to maximize the amplitude of the reflected ultrasonic pulse in monitoring the curing process of epoxy resin. The aim was to increase the ultrasonic wave path in the resin, keeping its amplitude detectable while making it possible to study thick samples. Samples 5.0 × 10–3 m thick were used in the measurements. During the curing process, the longitudinal wave speed ranged from 1475 to 2300 m/s and the attenuation ranged from 2.5 × 103 to 5.5 × 103 dB/m. Using a theoretical model for an ultrasonic wave traveling in a viscoelastic medium, and assuming that the density of epoxy resin does not change during the curing process, the compressibility coefficient was obtained as a function of the curing time. The values obtained for the compressibility coefficient ranged from 1.8 × 10– 10 to 4.3 × 10–10 Pa–1, in good agreement with literature values.
Evanescent wave fluorescence biosensors: Advances of the last decade
 Biosensor development has been a highly dynamic field of research and has progressed rapidly over the past two decades. The advances have accompanied the breakthroughs in molecular biology, nanomaterial sciences, and most importantly computers and electronics. The subfield of evanescent wave fluorescence biosensors has also matured dramatically during this time. Fundamentally, this review builds on our earlier 2005 review. While a brief mention of seminal early work will be included, this current review will focus on new technological developments as well as technology commercialized in just the last decade. Evanescent wave biosensors have found a wide array applications ranging from clinical diagnostics to biodefense to food testing; advances in those applications and more are described herein.
Shear-wave velocity structure beneath the central Tien Shan (NW China) from seismic ambient noise tomography
 A new shear-wave velocity model of the central Tien Shan is determined using seismic ambient noise tomography. Continuous seismic data are used to generate the three-dimensional shear-wave velocity structure. These data are recorded at 38 broadband seismic stations from the GHENGIS and KNET seismic networks in the central Tien Shan during June 1999 and August 2000. Our new tomographic model reveals prominent lateral heterogeneities in the central Tien Shan region. The shallow structure beneath the central Tien Shan shows a good spatial correlation with surface tectonics. Low- and high-velocity anomalies are imaged beneath basins and surrounding mountain ranges, respectively. Most large earthquakes are mainly distributed in the low-velocity anomalies or the transition zones from high- to low-velocity anomalies, suggesting most large earthquakes are not only associated with active faults but also related to the low-velocity anomalies. Pronounced low-velocity anomalies are imaged in the middle crust beneath the high-elevated mountain ranges, whereas a reverse structure can be seen beneath low-elevated basin ranges, which implies that the low-velocity anomalies caused by the upwelling of the hot and wet material into the crust from the upper mantle could have played an important role in the mountain building beneath the Tien Shan region. All these results provide seismic evidence for better understanding the dynamics process of the Tien Shan mountain building.
Experimental measurements of very fast transient voltages based on an electro-optic effect
 In this paper the Kerr electro-optic effect is considered from the aspect of its application in high-voltage engineering. Comparative analysis between measurements of electric fields established by fast transient voltages in liquid dielectrics with standard methods and with Kerr electro-optic effect is performed. Physical basiscs of the Kerr electro-optic effect are presented. Characteristics of a He–Ne laser significant for its application in the range of high voltage transient fields with Kerr electro-optic effect are pointed out.
Direct electro-optic effect in langasites and α-quartz
 Strain-constant (clamped) electro-optic coefficients r11S of langasite La3Ga5SiO14 (LGS), langatate La3Ga5.5Ta0.5O14 (LGT), catangasite Ca3TaGa3Si2O14 (CTGS) and α-quartz are measured at 1540 nm in the frequency range of 3–25 MHz. Experimental ratio of clamped and unclamped electro-optic coefficients r11S/r11T is 0.97 for LGS, 0.91 for LGT, 0.31 for CTGS, and 0.49 for quartz. Most of direct electro-optic effect in LGS and LGT is associated with lanthanum ions: clamped electro-optic coefficient r11S in lanthanum-free CTGS is 14 times less than in LGS. Low piezoelectric contribution to unclamped electro-optic coefficient r11T makes LGS and LGT promising materials for electro-optic devices, whose performance can be deteriorated by piezoelectric effect, especially, for high-voltage optical voltage sensors.
Selective Vulnerability of αOFF Retinal Ganglion Cells during Onset of Autoimmune Optic Neuritis
 Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a diverse body of neurons which relay visual signals from the retina to the higher processing regions of the brain, are susceptible to neurodegenerative processes in several diseases affecting the retina. Previous evidence shows that RGCs are damaged at early stages of autoimmune optic neuritis (AON), prior to subsequent degeneration of the optic nerve. In order to study cell type-specific vulnerability of RGCs we performed immunohistochemical and patch-clamp electrophysiological analyses of RGCs following induction of AON using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model in Brown Norway rats. We report that αRGCs are more susceptible to degeneration than the global RGC population as a whole, with functional and structural changes beginning even prior to demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of the optic nerve (where the RGC axons reside). Functional classification of αRGCs into OFF-sustained, OFF-transient and ON-sustained subtypes revealed that αOFF RGCs (both sustained and transient subtypes) are more vulnerable than αON RGCs, as indicated by reductions in light-evoked post-synaptic currents and retraction of dendritic arbours. Classification of neuronal susceptibility is a first step in furthering our understanding of what underlies a neuron’s vulnerability to degenerative processes, necessary for the future development of effective neuroprotective strategies.
Liquid level sensing for harsh environment applications using distributed fiber optic temperature measurements
 This work demonstrates the measurement of liquid level from spatially distributed temperature measurements using optical frequency domain reflectometry. The goal of this work is to provide initial evidence for a liquid level sensor concept that could be applied in harsh environments such as those with: conductive, flammable, or other chemically aggressive media; electromagnetic interference; high temperatures (up to ∼1000 °C); and neutron/gamma radiation. The sensor concept includes fiber optic sensors, along with an insulated heater wire assembled inside a protective Inconel 600 sheath. When the heater is not powered, the sensor provides spatially distributed temperature measurements along the length of the fiber. When the heater is powered, the difference in heat transfer in the liquid vs. vapor sections leads to a higher fiber temperature at locations above the liquid/vapor interface. The initial demonstration described in this work tested the sensor in a tank of water that was drained in increments of 2.5 cm. A model for determining liquid level from the distributed temperature measurements was developed that resulted in an accuracy of ±0.5 cm. The paper addresses potential effects of axial conduction through the sensor sheath, as well as ways to limit these effects to avoid “smearing” of what would otherwise be a step change in temperature at the liquid/vapor interface.
Waveguide coupled surface plasmon resonance based electro optic modulation in SBN thin films
 Modulation of light intensity utilizing Waveguide Coupled Surface Plasmon Resonance (WCSPR) technique at low driving voltage has been demonstrated in the present work. The high value of electro optic coefficient of Strontium Barium Niobate Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6(SBN60) makes it a promising material for the SPR based electro optic modulators. Prism coupling technique has been utilized for the excitation of surface plasmons in Strontium Barium Niobate (SBN) thin film in Otto configuration. Modulation of about 36% is observed due to a significant change in the refractive index of SBN60 thin film on application of electric field of 200 kV/cm. The transient response of change in reflectivity of the WCSPR system with electric field indicates the dynamic change of polarization state of SBN thin film.
Direct measurement of building transient and residual drift using an optical sensor system
 Interstory drift (ID) is a key response parameter for buildings subjected to lateral loads and is used to define performance-based limit states, allowable deformations and damage states in a number of seismic design codes and standards. An ability to rapidly and accurately measure both transient and residual ID during an earthquake would provide important observables for understanding the seismic demands and post-earthquake condition of a building. Accurate retrieval of ID from accelerometer-based instrumentation systems can be very challenging, if not impossible, as a result of instrumentation limitations and the post-processing associated with strong motion accelerometer data. This is particularly true for the case in which residual drifts occur during inelastic building response. In the study presented herein, a newly developed optical sensor system, designed specifically for directly measuring both transient and residual ID, was experimentally evaluated through shake table testing and computational simulations. The ability of the sensor to accurately measure ID is demonstrated and key operational considerations for sensor system deployment are examined through a model-based investigation.
Resonant enhancement of plasmonic nanostructured fiber optic sensors
 Improving the sensing capabilities of miniaturized probes nanofabricated on the tip of optical fibers is crucial for a large number of sensing applications in remote and harsh environ-ments. While most research efforts are directed towards developing improved fabrications techniques or more sensitive structures, we show that the performance of these sensors can be significantly enhanced by designing an appropriate interrogation strategy. In our scheme, a nanostructured plasmonic fiber probe is included in an optical fiber resonator and interrogated with a single-mode laser. A wavelength shift of the plasmonic resonance generates a mismatch of the resonator optical impedance, which is monitored and actively compensated by an optoelectronic gain element. We characterize the technique using samples with different refractive index and compare its performance to a conventional sensing scheme. Our cavity-enhanced configuration leads to a 50-fold improvement of the probe’s refractive index resolution (corresponding to a detection limit of 10−5 RIU, the lowest reported so far for this type of sensors). The demonstrated measurement scheme can be devised with any fiber-optic sensor that responds with a resonance shift or with an attenuation of the transmitted/reflected intensity.
Accurate optical measurement of high voltage waveform using novel optical liquid crystal based sensor
 We have developed a novel method for measuring electric field strength, and by inference, voltage for high power applications. This is achieved in a contact-less manner using a passive, liquid-crystal based optical device which guarantees galvanic isolation. We illustrate the method through a series of experiments in which we show that the device can measure electric field strength in a hysteresis-free and linear manner. The experimental setup restricted measurements to electric field strengths with an upper limit of 380 kV/m, but measurements of up to 2 MV/m should be possible. Applied voltage on a phase conductor can be measured to better than 1% accuracy for applied voltages above 10 kV and yet the device is sensitive enough to measure signals as low as 0.1 kV with no discernible drift. These results taken together demonstrate that our approach shows great promise for applications in which accurate high field strength or voltage measurements are required.
The transient electric field measurement system for EAST device
 The electromagnetic environment around the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) device is very complex during plasma discharge experiment. In order to fully monitor the changes of electric field around the EAST device during plasma discharge, a transient electric field measurement system based on PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) platform has been designed. A digitizer is used for high-speed data acquisition of raw signals from electric field sensors, and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) module is used for realizing an on-the-fly fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm including a beforehand identified antenna factor (AF) to achieve finally a calibrated and filtered electric field measurement, then these signals can be displayed and easily analyzed. The raw signals from electric field sensors are transferred through optical fiber by optical isolation to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). The high speed data streaming technology is used for data storage. A prototype of this system has been realized to measure the transient electric field strength, with the real-time processing and continuous acquisition ability of one channel of 14-bit resolution and up to 50 MHz sampling rate, and 6 KHz FFT frequency resolution.
Non-contact measurement of lightning and switching transient overvoltage based on capacitive coupling and pockels effects
 Measurement of lightning and switching transient overvoltage in power system is significant to the research that guides the protection of power system. A new type of sensor for non-contact measurement of lightning and switching transient overvoltage in power system is designed in this study. This sensor is composed of two parts, namely, voltage induction and optoelectronic conversion units. Given the existing stray coupling capacitor C1 between the transmission line or bus bar and a metal plate placed under it, a voltage induction unit is designed by utilizing the C1 and a capacitor with fixed value C2 connected in series, then the high-voltage non-contact induction on a transmission line or bus bar is achieved. The optoelectronic conversion unit is designed based on the Pockels effect of the LiNbO3 crystal. The voltage signal induced by the voltage induction unit can be converted to an optical signal by the optoelectronic conversion unit for long-distance transmission through optical fibers without power supply at the monitoring site. Laboratory and field tests revealed that the new developed sensor possesses good linear region, high precision, and wide frequency band of the response to lightning and switching transient overvoltage in power system. The sensor can also be applied to the non-contact measurement of lightning and switching transient overvoltage in power system with different voltage levels by conveniently adjusting the distance between the sensor and the line.
Experimental thermal investigation of an ONAN distribution transformer by fiber optic sensors
 Transformers are considered as one of the main and high cost components of the power systems. This is due to the fact that their failure may have negative influence on sustainability and quality of energy. In addition, some failures may lead to high cost for replacement or repair and an unplanned outage of a power transformer is highly uneconomical. As a result, as a major equipment in power systems, its correct functioning is vital to enable efficient and reliable operation of electric power system. A transformer can fail due to any combination of electrical, mechanical or thermal stresses. The normal operation life of a transformer is partially related to the deterioration of its insulation through thermal ageing, which is determined mainly by its daily cyclic loadings. In this paper, heat analysis of a 1.5 MVA Oil-Natural Air-Natural cooling mode distribution transformer is experimentally investigated by equipped fiber optic sensors. The density of the fiber optic sensors is increased at the active parts in critical spots. Temperature measurements are realized according to the transformer losses variation and load variation tests. The thermal behavior of the distribution transformer is obtained. Contrary to the existing studies, the obtained results show that also the structure and the design of the transformer affects the hot-spot position and temperature.
Effect of digital-to-analog converter glitch on the modulation and demodulation of a digital closed-loop fiber-optic gyroscope
 Dead zone or bias error, which is induced by a glitch in the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in a fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG) is proposed. The DAC glitch produces different forms of jamming signals and ultimately results in demodulation errors which depend on the modulation frequency and pass through zero at the proper frequency. The demodulation error is modelled as a piecewise function according to its characteristic, i.e., it appears to be a constant value when the staircase ramp ranges from 2n−2 to 2n−1 and remains zero when the staircase ramp outs of this range, where n is the bit length of the register. Simulations reveal that the staircase ramp oscillates, which leads to the dead zone when the equivalent angular velocity induced by the demodulation error is greater than the input angular velocity; otherwise, the staircase ramp resets with different slopes, which results in a bias error. We test the DAC glitch effect in a closed-loop FOG. The test results reveal that the dead zone induced by the demodulation error is consistent with that of the simulation results.
Fuzzy based damping controller for TCSC using local measurements to enhance transient stability of power systems
 This paper proposes a local fuzzy based damping controller (LFDC) for thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) to improve transient stability of power systems. In order to implement the proposed scheme, detailed model of TCSC, based on actual behavior of thyristor valves, is adopted. The LFDC uses the frequency at the TCSC bus as a local feedback signal, to control the firing angle. The parameters of fuzzy controller are tuned using an off-line method through chaotic optimization algorithm (COA). To verify the proposed LFDC, numerical simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simpower toolbox for the following case studies: two-area two-machine (TATM), WSCC three-machine nine-bus and Kundur’s two-area four-machine (TAFM) systems under various faults types. In this regard, to more evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation results are compared with the wide-area fuzzy based damping controller (WFDC). Moreover, the transient behavior of the detailed and phasor models of the TCSC is discussed in the TATM power system. The simulation results confirm that the proposed LFDC is an efficient tool for transient stability improvement since it utilizes only local signals, which are easily available.
Autoregulation and neurovascular coupling in the optic nerve head
 Impairments of autoregulation and neurovascular coupling in the optic nerve head play a critical role in ocular pathologies, especially glaucomatous optic neuropathy. We critically review the literature in the field, integrating results obtained in clinical, experimental, and theoretical studies. We address the mechanisms of autoregulation and neurovascular coupling in the optic nerve head, the current methods used to assess autoregulation—including measurements of optic nerve head blood flow (or volume and velocity)—blood flow data collected in the optic nerve head as pressure or metabolic demand is varied in healthy and pathologic conditions, and the current status and potential of mathematical modeling work to further the understanding of the relationship between ocular blood flow mechanisms and diseases such as glaucoma.
Rapid miniature fiber optic pressure sensors for blast wave measurements
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious potential threat to soldiers who are exposed to explosions. Since the pathophysiology of TBI associated with a blast wave is not clearly defined, it is crucial to have a sensing system to accurately quantify the blast wave dynamics. This paper presents an ultra-fast fiber optic pressure sensor based on Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometric principle that is capable of measuring the rapid pressure changes in a blast event. The blast event in the experiment was generated by a starter pistol blank firing at close range, which produced a more realistic wave profile compared to using compressed air driven shock tubes. To the authors' knowledge, it is also the first study to utilize fiber optic pressure sensors to measure the ballistics shock wave of a pistol firing. The results illustrated that the fiber optic pressure sensor has a rise time of 200 ns which demonstrated that the sensor has ability to capture the dynamic pressure transient during a blast event. Moreover, the resonant frequency of the sensor was determined to be 4.11 MHz, which agrees well with the specific designed value.
Dynamics of Interaction between the Road Surface and Vehicle's Wheel in Fibre-optic System for Automatic Weighing in Motion of Transport
 Vehicle's weight-in-motion (WIM) is one of important research areas of transport telematics. It is necessary for development of intelligent systems as well as for control of the legal use of road, and road pavement protection against overloading and distortion. The fibre-optic sensors (FOS) obtain the popularity nowadays for WIM applications. Experimental WIM system consists of six fibre-optic pressure sensors, temperature sensor, and induction loop, it produces the data for weight estimation in comparison with the results of measurement of reference vehicle by certified static WIM station. Presented research responds the attempts to suppose of odd component of FOS signal in the form of non-linear combination of the derivatives of even component that allows formulating the mathematical model of the dynamics of “wheel-road” system. The interpretation and estimation of coefficients of supposed model allows compensating for longitudinal and transverse oscillations of vehicle that leads to a reduction of axle's weight measurements errors in motion.
Compensation of parasitic losses in an extrinsic fiber-optic temperature sensor based on intensity measurement
 A method of referencing in an extrinsic optical fiber sensor system utilizing temperature dependence of the absorption edge in a semiconductor crystal (semi-insulating iron-doped indium phosphide) is demonstrated. The intensity reference is provided by controlling the temperature of an LED source and transmission measurements with different emission spectra. A transient operation regime is introduced. The entire process is controlled by a microprocessor unit. The performance of the sensor system is investigated and it is shown that the connector losses may be compensated for. Contrary to the published works performed with GaAs crystals it was not observed that the absorption coefficient of the semiconductor follows the law for idealized direct-gap semiconductor but can be described by the so-called Urbach tail. Since the proposed sensor system comprises a single LED source, simple electronics and no optical fiber couplers it is promising for realization of low-cost fiber-optic temperature sensors, e.g. for power transformer monitoring or magnetic resonance imaging applications.
Bless: A fiber optic sedimeter
 The working principle for a conceptually new sedimeter (BLESS — Bed LEvel Seeking System) is presented and experimentally tested. The proposed approach relies on the adoption of fiber Bragg grating arrays to measure temperature: the environment identification (flowing water vs. saturated soil) is achieved by means of the different temperature response to heat dissipation. The arrangement is potentially very robust with respect to the aquatic environment, as all vulnerable equipments are located above the water level, while only fiber optic and insulated electric wires with low DC voltage are immersed into water. A simple conceptual model can describe the thermodynamic response of the system. Experimental results fully confirm expectations. The technology can be considered ready for field installations.
Optical and X-ray scattering studies of the electric field-induced orientational order in colloidal suspensions of pigment nanorods
 Under pulsed or a.c. electric fields, colloidal suspensions of nanorods can show strong electro-optic effects, such as the Kerr effect, with fast response times (a few ms), which makes them good candidates for some commercial applications. For this purpose, suspensions of Pigment red 176 nanorods in dodecane were recently developed and their physical properties have been studied. We report here on the investigation of the orientational order induced by electric fields in isotropic suspensions of pigment nanorods by three different techniques: transient electric birefringence, transient electric dichroism, and in-situ small-angle X-ray scattering under electric field (“Electro-SAXS”). We show that, in spite of the apolar character of the solvent, the Maxwell-Wagner-O'Konski mechanism (i.e. the polarization of the counter-ion cloud around each particle) is responsible for the field-induced alignment of the nanorods. Although the particles are only weakly charged and the dielectric constant of dodecane is low, the pigment nanorods effectively behave as metallic particles in an insulating matrix and reach strong values (S ~0.5) of the induced nematic order parameter at moderate field amplitudes (~1 V/μm). This study confirms the feasibility of using suspensions of Pigment red 176 nanorods in dodecane for electro-optic applications.
A novel quaternary chalcogenide KBiCu2S3 based linear-dynamic-range optoelectronic device for optic communications systems
 A solar light optoelectronic device was fabricated using KBiCu2S3 and p-type silicon semiconductor. Electrical behavior of the optoelectronic device was characterized under solar light using current-electric field and phototransient current and capacitance-time measurements. Under solar light, the current at reverse bias region varies while the forward current did not change. The photoresponse ratio of photocurrent to dark current under 1000 W/m2 was determined to be 79. This ratio suggests that the KBiCu2S3/p-type silicon device is a photodevice with its photovoltaic behavior. The junction interface behavior of the device was analyzed by capacitance-electric field (CV) characteristics. The CV behavior of the device was corrected by the series resistance. KBiCu2S3/p-type silicon optoelectronic device. The device is called as FYTRONIX optoelectronic device as it works both photodevice and photocapacitor modes. The FYTRONIX optoelectronic device can be used as a optoelectronic device in optic communication system applications.
A miniature fiber optic blood pressure sensor and its application in in vivo blood pressure measurements of a swine model
 Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a promising technique in diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis. The technique is applied in coronary catheterization to measure the blood pressure (BP) difference across a coronary artery stenosis in the blood flow. In vivo BP measurement is the key element in FFR diagnosis. This paper describes the utilizing of a novel miniature fiber optic sensor to measure the BP of a swine model in vivo. A 25–50 kg Yorkshire swine model was used as the test target. A guiding catheter was introduced into the coronary artery, and blood pressure signals in aortic arch and right coronary artery were measured by the fiber optic sensor. A standard invasive manometry was used as the reference. Finally, a 2.25 mm balloon was inflated in the catheter to simulate the stenosis and the BP drop was recorded by the fiber optic sensor. The experiment demonstrates that the reported fiber optic sensor has the capability of measuring blood pressure in vivo and can be used for FFR technique.
Cell-Type-Specific Optical Recording of Membrane Voltage Dynamics in Freely Moving Mice
 Electrophysiological field potential dynamics are of fundamental interest in basic and clinical neuroscience, but how specific cell types shape these dynamics in the live brain is poorly understood. To empower mechanistic studies, we created an optical technique, TEMPO, that records the aggregate trans-membrane voltage dynamics of genetically specified neurons in freely behaving mice. TEMPO has >10-fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber-optic techniques and attains the noise minimum set by quantum mechanical photon shot noise. After validating TEMPO’s capacity to track established oscillations in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands, we compared the D1- and D2-dopamine-receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are interspersed and electrically indistinguishable. Unexpectedly, MSN population dynamics exhibited two distinct coherent states that were commonly indiscernible in electrical recordings and involved synchronized hyperpolarizations across both MSN subtypes. Overall, TEMPO allows the deconstruction of normal and pathologic neurophysiological states into trans-membrane voltage activity patterns of specific cell types.
Study of an integrated optical sensor with mono-shielding electrode for intense transient E-field measurement
 Intense E-field measurement is widely applied in high voltage and dielectric insulation research. In this paper, an integrated optical E-field sensor for time-domain measurement has been studied comprehensively, which is based on Mach–Zehnder interferometer with a mono-shielding electrode. Firstly, the principle and the key issues of the sensor design are presented. Secondly, the time-domain response characteristics are studied and the sensor can well follow waveforms with a rise time from nano-second to micro-second. Thirdly, the temperature stability of the sensor is analyzed, and the influence of temperature is quantified. Finally, the measurement of gas discharge field by the developed sensor is introduced, showing that the time-domain transient field measurement is an effective criterion for streamer inception.
The validity of Kohlrausch law for the photocurrent transient and the role of N2/Ar flow ratio in photoconductivity of sputtered CoZnO
 Co:ZnO (CZnO) ferromagnetic semiconductor layers are coated on the surface of glass and Si substrates by Magnetron Sputter Deposition Method (MSDM) with variable N2/Ar gas flow ratio. N2/Ar flow ratio varies from 5 sccm to 20 sccm, keeping the Ar gas flow constant (at 30 sccm). Sample's surface topography-composition, structure and optic properties are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultraviolet–visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometry. CZnO/p-Si structure exhibits both rectifying and photovoltaic behavior. Kohlrausch decay function is used to model the photocurrent transient curve and the associated relaxation process. The values of the photo charge density (ρph) and the relaxation time constant (τ0) are found to be 1.02 × 1011 Coul/cm−2 and 1.1 × 104 s, respectively. These findings suggest that CZnO/p-Si structure can be used in photodetector applications. The photoconductivity of the device can be tuned with the N2/Ar flow ratio since the property of CZnO thin films deposited from 3% Co doped ZnO target is dependent on the N2 and Ar atmosphere.
Transient response of a thermoelectric generator subjected to spatially non-uniform heating: Implications for heat and IR sensing applications
 We present a combined experimental and computational investigation of the transient behavior of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) subjected to temperature gradients of less than 0.5 K across its thickness. Such conditions can exist when TEGs are used as heat sensors or IR detectors. Spatially non-uniform heating was initiated by allowing light to strike the central portion of one side of the TEG or by placing a small heated probe in contact with that surface. The time-dependent, open circuit voltage output of the TEG was predicted using temperature results from a three dimensional transient heat conduction finite element model. It is shown that the transient voltage output is influenced by the configuration of the mounting hardware, by the thermal properties of the TEG’s materials of construction, and by convection. Three-dimensional heat conduction in the TEG determines the nature of the transient voltage output, which, in some cases, exhibits an overshoot.
The pattern ERG in chicks – Stimulus dependence and optic nerve section
 The chick is widely used in studies of eye growth regulation and myopia. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of pattern (p)ERG as a tool to assess retinal function in such studies. Effects of optical defocus and diffusing blur, manipulations used to alter eye growth experimentally, were evaluated. PERGs were recorded from White-Leghorn chickens, using a checkerboard pattern, including 8 spatial frequencies (0.05–2.2 c/d SF), 13 contrast levels (1–100%), and 8 temporal reversal frequencies (0.5–20 Hz). The acute effects of defocus and diffusing blur were examined. Flash- and pERGs were also recorded from chicks that underwent monocular optic nerve section (ONS), to explore the contribution of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Measurements were made up to 6 weeks post-ONS, complemented with SD-OCT imaging. In normal chicks, the response to 1 Hz, 100% contrast stimuli showed positive- and negative-going waveforms at 43 ms (P1) and 75 ms (N95), respectively, with 0.06–0.1 c/d SF eliciting the largest P1 amplitudes of 21.9 ± 2.5 μV. Contrast levels above 5% yielded measurable P1 responses. Responses were transient and monophasic for 0.5–5 Hz reversal rates, with higher temporal frequencies yielding steady state responses. Defocus and diffusing blur decreased pERG amplitude across all SFs. pERG responses remained normal after ONS, despite the loss of RGCs. In conclusion, chicks show robust pERG responses, which are attenuated by defocus and diffusing blur. The pERG response is not affected by ONS, suggesting that RGCs do not contribute to the chick pERG.
White-matter diffusion fMRI of mouse optic nerve
 Non-invasive assessment of white-matter functionality in the nervous system would be a valuable basic neuroscience and clinical diagnostic tool. Using standard MRI techniques, a visual-stimulus-induced 27% decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of water perpendicular to the axonal fibers (ADC⊥) is demonstrated for C57BL/6 mouse optic nerve in vivo. No change in ADC|| (diffusion parallel to the optic nerve fibers) was observed during visual stimulation. The stimulus-induced changes are completely reversible. A possible vascular contribution was sought by carrying out the ADC⊥ measurements in hypercapnic mice with and without visual stimulus. Similar effects were seen in room-air-breathing and hypercapnic animals. The in vivo stimulus-induced ADC⊥ decreases are roughly similar to literature reports for ex vivo rat optic nerve preparations under conditions of osmotic swelling. The experimental results strongly suggest that osmotic after-effects of nerve impulses through the axonal fibers are responsible for the observed ADC decrease.
Study of electric field distorted by space charges under positive lightning impulse voltage
 Actually, many insulation problems are related to electric fields. And measuring electric fields is an important research topic of high-voltage engineering. In particular, the electric field distortion caused by space charge is the basis of streamer theory, and thus quantitatively measuring the Poisson electric field caused by space charge is significant to researching the mechanism of air gap discharge. In this paper, we used our photoelectric integrated sensor to measure the electric field distribution in a 1-m rod-plane gap under positive lightning impulse voltage. To verify the reliability of this quantitative measurement, we compared the measured results with calculated results from a numerical simulation. The electric-field time domain waveforms on the axis of the 1-m rod-plane out of the space charge zone were measured with various electrodes. The Poisson electric fields generated by space charge were separated from the Laplace electric field generated by applied voltages, and the amplitudes and variations were measured for various applied voltages and at various locations. This work also supplies the feasible basis for directly measuring strong electric field under high voltage.
Research on Characteristics of Fiber Optic Sensors for Anthropomorphous Robots
 Structure, operating principle, theoretical provisions, experimental characteristics of fiber optic sensors for control of a bending in phalanxes of the anthropomorphous robot fingers, as well as principle of compensation for cross impact of adjacent measuring channels are considered. Linearization algorithm of positional characteristic of a sensor is given. The use of compensation algorithms of the cross impact and the linearization of the positional characteristic of sensing element offered to reduce nonlinearity of the sensor positional characteristic to 1% and to reduce the cross impact of different measuring channels to minus 20 dB, which is confirmed by experimental studies. Results of the experimental studies revealed that even without application of special temperature correction methods, the sensors used possess sufficiently high stability. Their phalanx temperature coefficient does not exceed 0,08%/°C. Assessment of high-speed performance of system, taking into account computing opportunities of the electronic transceiver is carried out. Technical characteristics of sensor prototypes and the electronic transceiver of fiber optical system are given.
A high-voltage low-cost wide-band fiber optic transmission system with improved linearity
 The paper presents the design, development and performance evaluation of an analog fiber optic link. It also describes the way the link was implemented as part of an approved high-voltage impulse measuring system, replacing the coaxial cable between the capacitive divider and the recording site. This link proved to have a large bandwidth of 105 MHz combined with a linearity of 0.6% and a very low cost. Results from tests were compared with those taken with the same measuring system using the coaxial cable for transmitting the impulses. The comparison shows that the measuring system with the optical link is better than the approved one with regard to important parameters, such as the response time and the steepness of the voltage collapse.
High speed temperature, pressure, and water vapor concentration measurement in explosive fireballs using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy
 Results from the design, development, and testing of a probe capable of making quantitative measurements of temperature, pressure, and water vapor concentration in near field explosive detonations are presented. This work extends established tunable diode laser absorption techniques to the field of explosive and energetic materials diagnostics with improved temporal resolution. Simultaneous measurement of temperature, pressure, and water vapor concentration were successfully measured at 30 kHz in a constant volume explosion at a standoff distance of 52 cm from 40 g of PBXN-5. Explosive testing was conducted in the 1.81 m3 blast chamber at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Energetic Materials Diagnostics Lab. Measured values compared very well to theoretical calculations for shocked air during the blast phase as well as late-time quasi static conditions. Data show a discrepancy between pressure and temperature equilibration times. This observation is attributed to comparatively slow mass diffusion of explosive products and thermal diffusion of heat relative to pressure equilibration through shock reflections.
Use of a fiber optic distributed temperature sensing system for thermal response testing of ground-coupled heat exchangers
 A thermal response test (TRT) is commonly conducted at a site proposed for the installation of a ground-coupled heat pump system. The purpose of the TRT is to gather local data to infer thermal properties of the soil. Accurately estimating soil thermal properties enables designers to size the geofield appropriately and supports improved simulations of ground heat exchanger (GHX) systems to better estimate the system performance over both shorter-term and longer-term intervals. This paper reports on the use of a fiber optic distributed temperature sensing system to spatially resolve the temperatures along the entire length of a U-tube within a vertical bore geothermal well. The fiber optic probe inside the U-tube provides spatial temperature data at a 2-m resolution throughout the duration of a TRT. The spatial temperature data within the U-tubes provided by a fiber optic probe offers the potential to determine other characteristics of a test bore, such as ground properties as a function of depth, which will enable much more accurate ground heat exchanger models in the future. An added outcome of this technique is a direct means to observe stratification of fluid temperatures which is another indicator of differences in ground properties that may occur along the depth of a vertical bore.
An emissivity-corrected method for the accurate radiometric measurement of transient surface temperatures during braking
 The main difficulty encountered in brake disc infrared temperature measurements is the lack of knowledge of the disc surface emissivity, which is nonuniform and varies during braking. To provide information on the nonuniformity and variations of emissivity, brake disc surface temperatures were investigated by an original two-colour fibre optic pyrometer and an infrared camera. The first result is the measurements of the accurate surface temperature. Besides, it is shown that the local emissivity varies with friction due to modifications of surface properties. Thermal phenomena observed on the disc track are correlated with temporal changes of normal and tangential frictional forces.
High voltage resolution with a laser diode based electro-optic measurement system
 A laser diode based measurement system with low invasiveness for the detection of fast electrical waveforms on lines in integrated circuits has been developed. The system employs an external electro-optic crystal sensor with a reference electrode for calibrated amplitude measurements. Its high voltage sensitivity of 2 mV/√Hz and high temporal resolution are demonstrated by measurements of a FM-IF-demodulator circuit and CMOS handshake circuits.
Initial operation of 3 MW dual output high voltage power supply with IC RF system
 Pulse Step Modulation (PSM) based High Voltage Power Supplies (HVPSs) are widely used in fusion research and other applications viz. broadcast transmitters, particle accelerators and neutral beam injectors because of inherent advantages of modular structure, high accuracy and efficiency, low ripple and fast dynamics. Typical Ion Cyclotron Radio Frequency (IC RF) system composed of cascaded connection of Driver stage (130 kW RF output) and End stage (1500 kW RF Output) would need two power supplies. A novel concept of tapping two outputs from single PSM based HVPS is attempted for the first time. PSM based 3 MW HVPS is developed with dual output to feed anode voltage of Driver (up to 18 kV) and Final Stage (up to 27 kV). Controller for the HVPS is designed to suit requirements during local operation and remote operation. In Local operation mode, protection interlocks with in the HVPS are integrated while remote mode has additional interlocks from IC RF Amplifiers system. Field integration of the controller is achieved through fiber optical links to avoid Electro-Magnetic interferences. Present article discusses initial experience of dual output HVPS with IC RF amplifiers, pre-integration validation campaigns including qualification for energy limits. The paper also presents the performance of HVPS at full rated capacity of 2800 kW continuous duty to support 1.5 MW IC RF system.
System for gas pressure measurements in the arc plasma environment
 Developed measurements system for evaluation of gas pressure value in direct vicinity of switching arc plasma was described in this paper. The system is resistant to heavy duty conditions present inside the MV switch quenching chamber and its functionality was verified during large scale functional tests. In this paper results of gas pressure measurements performed for a current interrupter equipped with an arc quenching system based on combination of forced air flow and gassing material ablation were presented. Gas pressure was measured by means of developed system, for several values of capacitive load current at 12/24 kV supplying voltage.
Long-term and wideband laser intensity stabilization with an electro-optic amplitude modulator
 This paper aims at two practical design issues encountered with electro-optic amplitude modulators, namely (1) the long-term optical power drift when a single electro-optic crystal is used and (2) the mechanical resonances of the crystal that limit the control bandwidth. We investigated an active control scheme using a single crystal to offset the drifts of different origins such as polarization, crystal birefringence, and electronics. The control system worked continuously for at least 15 h without interruption and a power instability of 8×10−4 was achieved in a 3-h measurement. This technique can be employed in electro-optic applications where two matched crystals are usually used to compensate the birefringence-related drifts. Meanwhile, mechanical resonances in two crystals (LiNbO3 and KTiOPO4) were mapped out and their influences on the control bandwidth were quantitatively investigated. Residual noises of two intensity-stabilized lasers (a Helium–Neon laser and a dye laser) were analyzed in detail.
High performance chitosan diaphragm-based fiber-optic acoustic sensor
 A miniature fiber-optic Fabry–Perot is fabricated directly on the tip of a single mode fiber. The active sensing element is a thin linear polysaccharide (chitosan) diaphragm with thickness of only 1.5 μm. The chitosan diaphragm exhibits excellent physicochemical properties that include membrane-forming ability, good adhesion, insensitive to background pressure and high mechanical strength. Together with fiber-optic Fabry–Perot interferometric's inherent advantages, the chitosan diaphragm-based Fabry–Perot sensor becomes a wonderful candidate for dynamic pressure measurement such as acoustic pressure. A chitosan diaphragm-based miniature Fabry–Perot system for acoustic pressure measurement is presented which exhibits high sensitivity of 0.002 V/mPa at 1 kHz with frequency response from range 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Analysis and discussion on launching mechanism and tactical electromagnetic railgun technology
 This paper begins with a discussion on the significance of multi-physical fields in the research of railgun launching mechanism, followed by an introduction of research work about dynamic measurements and numerical simulations. The application of some measurement methods including the atomic emission spectrum, fiber-optic strain, optical level, pulsed X-ray, and high-speed video in observing the launching process was introduced. The models about the electromechanical dynamic processes and multi-physical fields in a railgun were developed. The mechanisms of the grooving, arc transition, and gouging were analyzed. These work provided a deeper understanding of launching mechanism of electromagnetic railgun. Some issues about the tactical railgun, such as the fiber composite overwrapped barrel, recoil, loading modes and eddy current loss were also discussed. Taking a medium-caliber launcher as an example, the basic process of design and analysis was introduced.
Monitoring synaptic and neuronal activity in 3D with synthetic and genetic indicators using a compact acousto-optic lens two-photon microscope
 Two-photon microscopy is widely used to study brain function, but conventional microscopes are too slow to capture the timing of neuronal signalling and imaging is restricted to one plane. Recent development of acousto-optic-deflector-based random access functional imaging has improved the temporal resolution, but the utility of these technologies for mapping 3D synaptic activity patterns and their performance at the excitation wavelengths required to image genetically encoded indicators have not been investigated. Here, we have used a compact acousto-optic lens (AOL) two-photon microscope to make high speed [Ca2+] measurements from spines and dendrites distributed in 3D with different excitation wavelengths (800–920 nm). We show simultaneous monitoring of activity from many synaptic inputs distributed over the 3D arborisation of a neuronal dendrite using both synthetic as well as genetically encoded indicators. We confirm the utility of AOL-based imaging for fast in vivo recordings by measuring, simultaneously, visually evoked responses in 100 neurons distributed over a 150 μm focal depth range. Moreover, we explore ways to improve the measurement of timing of neuronal activation by choosing specific regions within the cell soma. These results establish that AOL-based 3D random access two-photon microscopy has a wider range of neuroscience applications than previously shown. Our findings show that the compact AOL microscope design has the speed, spatial resolution, sensitivity and wavelength flexibility to measure 3D patterns of synaptic and neuronal activity on individual trials.
Relevance of cardiomyocyte mechano-electric coupling to stretch-induced arrhythmias: Optical voltage/calcium measurement in mechanically stimulated cells, tissues and organs
 Stretch-induced arrhythmias are multi-scale phenomena in which alterations in channel activities and/or calcium handling lead to the organ level derangement of the heart rhythm. To understand how cellular mechano-electric coupling (MEC) leads to stretch-induced arrhythmias at the organ level, we developed stretching devices and optical voltage/calcium measurement techniques optimized to each cardiac level. This review introduces these experimental techniques of (1) optical voltage measurement coupled with a carbon-fiber technique for single isolated cardiomyocytes, (2) optical voltage mapping combined with motion tracking technique for myocardial tissue/whole heart preparations and (3) real-time calcium imaging coupled with a laser optical trap technique for cardiomyocytes. Following the overview of each methodology, results are presented. We conclude that individual MEC in cardiomyocytes can be heterogeneous at the ventricular level, especially when moderate amplitude mechanical stretches are applied to the heart, and that this heterogeneous MEC can evoke focal excitation that develops into re-entrant arrhythmias.
The 100 kV Faraday cage (High Voltage Deck) for the SPIDER experiment
 In order to optimize the design and operation of the Ion Source for the ITER Neutral Beam Injector (NBI), a dedicated 100 keV Ion Source, identified as Source for the Production of Ions of Deuterium Extracted from RF plasma (SPIDER), is under construction in the Neutral Beam Test Facility, at the Consorzio RFX premises, in Padua, Italy. The Ion Source, polarized at −112 kVdc voltage, will produce negative ions (Deuterium D− or Hydrogen H−) which, extracted from the Plasma Grid with an extraction voltage up to 12 keV, are accelerated up to 100 keV by the 100 kVdc Power Supply (100 kV PS). The required Ion Source and the Extraction Power Supplies (ISEPS) system and the associated diagnostics are hosted inside a High Voltage Deck (HVD), a −100 kVdc air-insulated Faraday cage. These power supplies and various diagnostics and control equipment are connected to the Ion Source by means of a High Voltage Transmission Line (TL). The HVD (procurement started mid 2013; delivery on site in the second half of 2014) will consist of a wide structure (13 m (L) × 11 m (W) × 5 m (H)), designed to support the weight of the ISEPS components, mounted on supporting insulators and clad with a conductive metal sheet in order to reduce the electromagnetic interference (EMI). The paper reports on the design solutions of the HVD focusing on insulation, mechanical, thermal and EMI issues. The details of the main HVD interfaces with the TL and with insulating transformer are also described. Finite Element (FE) analyses have been performed, on the one hand, to verify the configuration from the electrostatic point of view and, on the other, to evaluate electrical screen effectiveness from the EMI point of view.
Anatomy of the Optic Nerve and Visual Pathway
 Visual information is transduced in the retinas and transmitted via the optic nerves. At the optic chiasm some fibers decussate while others remain ipsilateral to facilitate contralateral visual field representation in post-chiasmatic structures. The anatomy and physiology facilitate localization of lesions. In turn, anatomic localization narrows the differential diagnosis of disease facilitating focused laboratory and radiographic investigation. In turn, treatments are directed based on localization and diagnosis.
Multiphase Flow Measurement
 Starting with the historical background, multiphase flow metering has been discussed with various types of multiphase flow possibilities with flow classifications such as bubble, slug, annular, and dispersed flows and regimes along with constraints for measurement, such as slip and slip effect. VGF, phase fraction measurement along with superficial velocity measurement in multiphase flow measurement is very important and various techniques with different technologies including gamma ray, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) are discussed in detail. Two-phase flow is the most common multiphase flow, so issues associated with velocity, density, and phase fraction measurement with technology details have been included. Wet gas measurement and water cut monitoring instruments have been discussed in detail. Various types of multiphase measurement scheme, such as separation, partial separation, and sampling methods, have been covered, along with well testing and production optimization. Various technological details for multiphase measurements starting with conventional instruments like differential pressure, Coriolis meter, then through microwave, sonar, wire mesh, needle probe electrical impedance tomography, including modern virtual measuring systems. The chapter also cover in detail all tomography types including gamma/X-ray, neutron/positron, optical, ultrasonic electrical impedance with computerized tomography. Comprehensive discussions on meter selection, specification, installation, testing calibration, and commissioning of meters have also been covered.
Rheology of complex fluids with vibrating fiber-optic sensors
 We demonstrate a new optical rheometer where a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG) detects the periodical strain caused by the oscillations of a string tightened within a sample fluid. We show that the viscoelastic moduli of complex fluids can be obtained instantaneously from the FBG optical backreflection signal, without need of any current flow in the wire or magnetic field that could affect the sample chemistry. After a validation with known-viscosity solutions, the technique is employed to monitor the phase transition of a sol-gel compound. The results provide an insight in the early-stage gelation dynamics that cannot be obtained with traditional rheometers, and allow to clearly identify the gel point as the intersection of the viscoelastic moduli.
Measurement Signal Transmission
 This chapter covers the techniques that are used for transmitting measurement signals over what can, in some circumstances, be quite large distances. The discussion starts with electrical transmission. This is the simplest way to convey measurement signals over some distance but there is a tendency for the measured signal to be corrupted by noise, and there is an appropriate discussion about how to deal with such noise problems by amplifying measurement signals and shielding transmission wires. Discussion then continues with current loop transmission and AC carrier transmission (using either amplitude modulation or frequency modulation), which are alternative ways of transmitting signals electrically without noise corruption. Next, pneumatic transmission is explained, which, although much less common than in the past, is still used in some industrial applications because of its intrinsic safety. The discussion then moves on to fiber optic transmission, which, though more expensive than electrical transmission, offers intrinsically safe transmission without noise corruption of the transmitted signal. Moving on, the chapter covers wireless optical and radio telemetry. Finally, the strong merits of digital transmission are considered.
Electro-optic Kerr effect in the study of mixtures of oppositely charged colloids. The case of polymer-surfactant mixtures in aqueous solutions
 In this review I highlight a very sensitive experimental technique for the study of polymer-surfactant complexation: The electro-optic Kerr effect. This review does not intend to be exhaustive in covering the Kerr Effect nor polymer-surfactant systems, instead it aims to call attention to an experimental technique that, even if applied in a qualitative manner, could give very rich and unique information about the structures and aggregation processes occurring in mixtures of oppositely charged colloids. The usefulness of electric birefringence experiments in the study of such systems is illustrated by selected results from literature in hope of stimulating the realization of more birefringence experiments on similar systems. This review is mainly aimed at, but not restricted to, researchers working in polyelectrolyte-surfactant mixtures in aqueous solutions, Kerr effect is a powerful experimental tool that could be used in the study of many systems in diverse areas of colloidal physics.
Simultaneous observation of lightning emission in different wave ranges of electromagnetic spectrum in Tien Shan mountains
 Simultaneous registration of electromagnetic emission generated by atmospheric lightning discharges in the radio-frequency (f = 0.1–30 MHz), infrared (λ = 610–800 nm), ultraviolet (λ = 240–380 nm), and in the soft energy gamma-radiation (Eγ = 0.1–4 MeV) ranges of electromagnetic spectrum was made synchronously in mountain conditions with complex detector system of the Tien Shan High-Mountain Cosmic Ray Station. We discuss preliminary results of these measurements and perspectives of future application of the multispectral investigation technique to study of the effects of thunderstorm activity.
Synchronized measurement technology supported AC and HVDC online disturbance detection
 In electric power system, disturbance detection has become an important part of grid operation and refers to the detection of a voltage and current excursion caused by the wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena. This paper proposes a computationally efficient and robust algorithm for synchronized measurement technology (SMT) supported online disturbance detection, suitable for AC and HVDC grids. The proposed algorithm is based on the robust median absolute deviation sample dispersion measure to locate dataset outliers. The algorithm is capable of identifying the disturbance occurrence and clearance measurement sample based on the dynamic criteria, driven by present power system conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by real-time simulations using a cyber-physical simulation platform, as a co-simulation between the SMT supported electric power system model and underlying ICT infrastructure. The presented results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, making it suitable for an AC and HVDC online disturbance detection application or as a pre-step of backup protection schemes.
Direct Measurement of the Photoelectric Response Time of Bacteriorhodopsin via Electro-Optic Sampling
 The photovoltaic signal associated with the primary photochemical event in an oriented bacteriorhodopsin film is measured by directly probing the electric field in the bacteriorhodopsin film using an ultrafast electro-optic sampling technique. The inherent response time is limited only by the laser pulse width of 500 fs, and permits a measurement of the photovoltage with a bandwidth of better than 350 GHz. All previous published studies have been carried out with bandwidths of 50 GHz or lower. We observe a charge buildup with an exponential formation time of 1.68 ± 0.05 ps and an initial decay time of 31.7 ps. Deconvolution with a 500-fs Gaussian excitation pulse reduces the exponential formation time to 1.61 ± 0.04 ps. The photovoltaic signal continues to rise for 4.5 ps after excitation, and the voltage profile corresponds well with the population dynamics of the K state. The origin of the fast photovoltage is assigned to the partial isomerization of the chromophore and the coupled motion of the Arg-82 residue during the primary event.
Resonant micromechanical fiber optic sensor of relative humidity
 This paper presents a novel type of humidity sensor which is based on silicon micromechanical resonant structure with an attached silica gel granule. The mechanical oscillations of microstructure are interrogated with the aid of fiber-optic Fabry–Perot interferometer. The output signal of such a sensor in the frequency form is not sensitive to long-term variations of the optical power and it can be easily digitized by counting the periods. Two-channel PLL was used for the first time to track the resonant frequency at any interferometer working point position. The design of a sensor turned out to be rather successful: the mass of the air moisture absorbed by silica gel granule turned out to be dependent linearly on the relative humidity in the range from 0% to 75% that simplifies the calibration of the sensor; and the high quality factor of the mechanical resonator allowed us to resolve the resonant frequency with precision about 0.1 Hz, which corresponds to sensor threshold sensitivity in 0.02% of relative air humidity.
Mitochondrial optic neuropathies – Disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies
 Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and autosomal-dominant optic atrophy (DOA) are the two most common inherited optic neuropathies in the general population. Both disorders share striking pathological similarities, marked by the selective loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the early involvement of the papillomacular bundle. Three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations; m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A, and m.14484T>C account for over 90% of LHON cases, and in DOA, the majority of affected families harbour mutations in the OPA1 gene, which codes for a mitochondrial inner membrane protein. Optic nerve degeneration in LHON and DOA is therefore due to disturbed mitochondrial function and a predominantly complex I respiratory chain defect has been identified using both in vitro and in vivo biochemical assays. However, the trigger for RGC loss is much more complex than a simple bioenergetic crisis and other important disease mechanisms have emerged relating to mitochondrial network dynamics, mtDNA maintenance, axonal transport, and the involvement of the cytoskeleton in maintaining a differential mitochondrial gradient at sites such as the lamina cribosa. The downstream consequences of these mitochondrial disturbances are likely to be influenced by the local cellular milieu. The vulnerability of RGCs in LHON and DOA could derive not only from tissue-specific, genetically-determined biological factors, but also from an increased susceptibility to exogenous influences such as light exposure, smoking, and pharmacological agents with putative mitochondrial toxic effects. Our concept of inherited mitochondrial optic neuropathies has evolved over the past decade, with the observation that patients with LHON and DOA can manifest a much broader phenotypic spectrum than pure optic nerve involvement. Interestingly, these phenotypes are sometimes clinically indistinguishable from other neurodegenerative disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and multiple sclerosis, where mitochondrial dysfunction is also thought to be an important pathophysiological player. A number of vertebrate and invertebrate disease models has recently been established to circumvent the lack of human tissues, and these have already provided considerable insight by allowing direct RGC experimentation. The ultimate goal is to translate these research advances into clinical practice and new treatment strategies are currently being investigated to improve the visual prognosis for patients with mitochondrial optic neuropathies.
Temporal Dynamics of Microbial Rhodopsin Fluorescence Reports Absolute Membrane Voltage
 Plasma membrane voltage is a fundamentally important property of a living cell; its value is tightly coupled to membrane transport, the dynamics of transmembrane proteins, and to intercellular communication. Accurate measurement of the membrane voltage could elucidate subtle changes in cellular physiology, but existing genetically encoded fluorescent voltage reporters are better at reporting relative changes than absolute numbers. We developed an Archaerhodopsin-based fluorescent voltage sensor whose time-domain response to a stepwise change in illumination encodes the absolute membrane voltage. We validated this sensor in human embryonic kidney cells. Measurements were robust to variation in imaging parameters and in gene expression levels, and reported voltage with an absolute accuracy of 10 mV. With further improvements in membrane trafficking and signal amplitude, time-domain encoding of absolute voltage could be applied to investigate many important and previously intractable bioelectric phenomena.
Fiber-optic dielectric multilayer temperature sensor: in situ measurement in vitreous during Er:YAG laser irradiation
 A fiber-optic instrument for temperature measurement is presented. The sensing element consists of an optical dielectric multilayer system acting as a micro-interferometer which is deposited on a single-mode fiber tip. The sensitivity of the implemented system is theoretically derived and experimentally determined by a calibration measurement. The small size of the probe makes the system well-suited, for instance, for endoscopic in vitro and in vivo measurements in medical applications, especially in small samples. The sensor is used for the investigation of the transient thermal behavior of vitreous during Er:YAG laser irradiation in order to study the local thermal effects that are important to minimize the potential for unintentional injury in laser vitrectomy and laser vitreoretinal surgery.
Measurement of aluminum oxide film by Fabry–Pérot interferometry and scanning electron microscopy
 A novel experimental scheme for real time measurement of aluminum oxide film during anodization was developed for the first time. The scheme was established based on a combination of a fiber optic sensor of Fabry–Pérot interferometry and direct current (DC) electrochemical methods. The scheme was assembled in a way to simultaneously anodize the aluminum samples and to measure the thickness of the aluminum oxide film. The anodization process of aluminum sample was carried out in 4% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution by the DC methods at room temperature. The estimated thickness of the aluminum oxide film by the novel scheme was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemistry measurements. This study shows that real time measurement of the thickness of aluminum oxide film is feasible as it closely matched the thickness determined by SEM and other electrochemistry techniques.
Critical Role of the CXCL10/C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 3 Axis in Promoting Leukocyte Recruitment and Neuronal Injury during Traumatic Optic Neuropathy Induced by Optic Nerve Crush
 Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is an acute injury of the optic nerve secondary to trauma. Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a key pathological process in TON, yet mechanisms responsible for RGC death remain unclear. In a mouse model of TON, real-time noninvasive imaging revealed a dramatic increase in leukocyte rolling and adhesion in veins near the optic nerve (ON) head at 9 hours after ON injury. Although RGC dysfunction and loss were not detected at 24 hours after injury, massive leukocyte infiltration was observed in the superficial retina. These cells were identified as T cells, microglia/monocytes, and neutrophils but not B cells. CXCL10 is a chemokine that recruits leukocytes after binding to its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 3. The levels of CXCL10 and CXCR3 were markedly elevated in TON, and up-regulation of CXCL10 was mediated by STAT1/3. Deleting CXCR3 in leukocytes significantly reduced leukocyte recruitment, and prevented RGC death at 7 days after ON injury. Treatment with CXCR3 antagonist attenuated TON-induced RGC dysfunction and cell loss. In vitro co-culture of primary RGCs with leukocytes resulted in increased RGC apoptosis, which was exaggerated in the presence of CXCL10. These results indicate that leukocyte recruitment in retinal vessels near the ON head is an early event in TON and the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis has a critical role in recruiting leukocytes and inducing RGC death.
A fiber optic-based system for behavioral eyeblink measurement in a MRI environment
 We previously described a reliable system to control the timing of multiple stimuli and to detect behavioral eyeblink responses in fMRI studies of learning in animals. Here, we report a significant advancement of the original system, which incorporates a fiber-optic probe in order to avoid the interference associated with the application of pulsed field gradients during MR imaging, particularly echo planar imaging. Eyeblink responses recorded with our fiber-optic probe and modified detection circuit demonstrate the ability of our new system to acquire behavioral data free of gradient-induced artifacts, thereby eliminating the need for low-pass filtering. This fiber optic-based system should be applicable to both animal and human imaging experiments.
Subcellular Imaging of Voltage and Calcium Signals Reveals Neural Processing In Vivo
 A mechanistic understanding of neural computation requires determining how information is processed as it passes through neurons and across synapses. However, it has been challenging to measure membrane potential changes in axons and dendrites in vivo. We use in vivo, two-photon imaging of novel genetically encoded voltage indicators, as well as calcium imaging, to measure sensory stimulus-evoked signals in the Drosophila visual system with subcellular resolution. Across synapses, we find major transformations in the kinetics, amplitude, and sign of voltage responses to light. We also describe distinct relationships between voltage and calcium signals in different neuronal compartments, a substrate for local computation. Finally, we demonstrate that ON and OFF selectivity, a key feature of visual processing across species, emerges through the transformation of membrane potential into intracellular calcium concentration. By imaging voltage and calcium signals to map information flow with subcellular resolution, we illuminate where and how critical computations arise.
Piezoelectric and fibre-optic hydrophones
 This chapter considers the many different types of hydrophone – both piezoelectric and fibre-optic. It begins with a presentation of the functional qualities common to all device types. As each design of hydrophone is introduced, its performance in terms of these general characteristics is assessed. Although the organisation of the chapter introduces piezoelectric hydrophones separately from their fibre-optic counterparts, there are many similarities between the two classes, and these are identified and considered throughout. Whilst piezoelectric hydrophones have been available for decades and have thus gained widespread acceptance in ultrasound metrology, fibre-optic hydrophones are a relatively recent development. Consequently, the consideration of such devices is given specific emphasis in order to shed further light on this rapidly developing field of study.
Nuclear reactor pulse calibration using a CdZnTe electro-optic radiation detector
 A CdZnTe electro-optic radiation detector was used to calibrate nuclear reactor pulses. The standard configuration of the Pockels cell has collimated light passing through an optically transparent CdZnTe crystal located between crossed polarizers. The transmitted light was focused onto an IR sensitive photodiode. Calibrations of reactor pulses were performed using the CdZnTe Pockels cell by measuring the change in the photodiode current, repeated 10 times for each set of reactor pulses, set between 1.00 and 2.50 dollars in 0.50 increments of reactivity.
An open-source control system for in vivo fluorescence measurements from deep-brain structures
 Intracranial photometry through chronically implanted optical fibers is a widely adopted technique for measuring signals from fluorescent probes in deep-brain structures. The recent proliferation of bright, photo-stable, and specific genetically encoded fluorescent reporters for calcium and for other neuromodulators has greatly increased the utility and popularity of this technique. Here we describe an open-source, cost-effective, microcontroller-based solution for controlling optical components in an intracranial photometry system and processing the resulting signal. We show proof-of-principle that this system supports high quality intracranial photometry recordings from dorsal striatum in freely moving mice. A single system supports simultaneous fluorescence measurements in two independent color channels, but multiple systems can be integrated together if additional fluorescence channels are required. This system is designed to work in combination with either commercially available or custom-built optical components. Parts can be purchased for less than one tenth the cost of commercially available alternatives and complete assembly takes less than one day for an inexperienced user. Currently available hardware draws on a variety of commercial, custom-built, or hybrid elements for both optical and electronic components. Many of these hardware systems are either specialized and inflexible, or over-engineered and expensive. This open-source system increases experimental flexibility while reducing cost relative to current commercially available components. All software and firmware are open-source and customizable, affording a degree of experimental flexibility that is not available in current commercial systems.
A high resolution tilt measurement system based on multi-accelerometers
 In this paper, a wireless tilt measurement system of high resolution is proposed and demonstrated using multiple MEMS (Micro-electromechanical Systems) accelerometers. The measurement system is mainly composed of MEMS accelerometers as sensing unit, a MCU (Micro Controller Unit), wireless transceivers, battery and a PC terminal. Three MEMS accelerometers are purposely located with specific orientations and the system output is determined from the accelerometer that is most sensitive in the tilting range of the object under testing. The raw measured signal collected by the MCU is processed using Kalman Filter (KF) and the analyzed data is transmitted to the PC terminal by a wireless module. The effect of different KF parameters are analyzed using the Allan variance. After eliminating the accelerometers’ installation errors, the measuring resolution of system is found to be 0.02° in the whole range from 0° to 360°. In the step test of tilting back and forth, it is found that the absolute measurement error is less than 0.004° for the step change of 0.05°.
Stabilized fiber-optic extrinsic Fabry–Perot sensor system for acoustic emission measurement
 A fiber-optic Fabry–Perot (F–P) acoustic emission (AE) sensor system based on an improved double wavelength stabilization technique is described. Without stabilization, the sensor system drifts out of quadrature due to the presence of low-frequency dynamic strains. The stabilization is achieved by using a dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) to generate two quadrature phase-shifted output signals. An optimum model of double wavelength stabilization is established. The filtering wavelengths of DWDM are calculated using an optimization design method. The performance of the developed sensor system was verified by two preliminary tests. One was a test on the stabilization of operating point of fiber-optic F–P sensor, and other was the detection of simulated AE signals generated by the impact and pencil lead breaking. The test results demonstrate that simulated AE signals are successfully detected using this stabilized sensor system, which solves the fade-out problem.
Current and Voltage Transformers
 Current and voltage transformers are required to transform high currents and voltages into more manageable quantities for measurement, protection, and control. This chapter describes the properties of current transformers (CTs) and voltage transformers (VTs), and how to specify them for particular applications. A current transformer is used to transform a primary current quantity in terms of its magnitude and phase to a secondary value such that in normal conditions the secondary value is substantially proportional to the primary value. IEC 60044 (instrument transformers) covers CTs and VTs, superseding IEC 60185 (current transformers for measuring and protective applications) and its predecessor IEC 185. IEC 60044 applies to both electromagnetic (inductive) and capacitor type voltage transformers, superseding IEC 60186 and its predecessor IEC186. For protection purposes VTs are required to maintain specified accuracy limits down to 2% of rated voltage.
Measurement Signal Transmission
 This chapter focuses on techniques for transmitting measurement signals over what can be quite large distances completes the discussion on the different components that exist in a measurement system. The need to separate the processing or recording parts of a measurement system from the point of measurement can arise for several reasons. The simplest method of electrical transmission is to transmit the measurement signal as a varying analogue voltage. However, this mode of transmission often causes the measurement signal to become corrupted by noise. It is also usually necessary to provide shielding for the signal wires. Shielding consists of surrounding the signal wires in a cable with a metal shield connected to the earth. Signals are normally transmitted along a fiber-optic cable in digital format, although analogue transmission is sometimes used. If there is a requirement to transmit more than one signal, it is more economical to multiplex the signals onto a single cable rather than transmit the signals separately on multiple cables.
Status and future developments of R&D on fiber optics current sensor for ITER
 Successful operation of ITER will rely on the use of a large set of magnetic diagnostics. Fundamental parameters such as plasma position, shape, and current are required for real-time plasma control and machine protection. For operating tokamaks such measurements are successfully performed using inductive sensors. In ITER and later in DEMO, the presence of strong radiations combined with steady-state operation creates a difficult problem: the useful signal is affected by the integration of radiation-induced noise. An attractive alternative for plasma current measurement consists in using Fiber Optic Current Sensor (FOCS). However, combined effects of radiation, elevated temperatures, vibrations together with the requirement of vacuum compatibility and installation constrains present a significant challenge for the ITER FOCS system. This paper describes recent results of the ITER FOCS R&D intended to demonstrate that the system can be installed on the tokamak and its performance can satisfy the required criteria. We emphasize that the choice of appropriate fibers is critical. Our simulations show that the spun fibers allow satisfying the target performance provided that the fiber beat length over spun period ratio is above a given value. This conclusion is confirmed by the experimental results obtained on JET.
Wide Area Measurement Technology in Power Systems
 Deregulation, competitive electricity market, expansion of transmission and distribution network, reliable electricity supply, increased applications of power electronics make the power system more complex. Therefore, many times power system has to operate closure to their maximum limits so as to use existing assets more efficiently. To operate under these constraints and still maintain high reliability is a very challenging task for power system generation, operation and planning requiring new intelligent system, technology and solutions. For decades, traditional supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) measurements have been providing information on bus voltage, transmission line, generator, and transformer flows, transformer taps, breaker status as well as others system parameters. However, monitoring, operate and control of such large power system grid only steady state information may not be sufficient. Synchrophasor measurement technology (Wide area measurement technology) is a new term, which provides dynamic view of the grid. This paper introduces the role and advantages of using wide area measurement technology by answering three fundamental questions: what is wide area measurement technology; why is it needed and where does it best fit.
An isotropic intense electromagnetic impulse (EMP) sensor using integrated electro-optic (EO) probe
 An isotropic intense electromagnetic impulse (EMP) sensor has been designed, fabricated and measured using three Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) integrated optical waveguide electric field probes. Experiment results demonstrate that the sensor has flat response from 100 kHz to 1 GHz with a variation less than ±3 dB, and the sensor detected electric field waveform agrees well with the applied quasi-standard high altitude nuclear electromagnetic impulse (HNEMP). Besides, the sensor exhibits linear response from 2.2 kV/m to 56.8 kV/m, and the minimum detectable electric field in the time domain is approximately equal to 427.2 V/m.
Integrated voltage regulation in distribution grids with photovoltaic distribution generation assisted by telecommunication infrastructure
 Massive penetration of Distributed Generation Photovoltaic Systems – DGPV – connected to the power distribution grid through electronic inverters can contribute, in an aggregate scenario, to the performance of several power system control functions, notably in voltage regulation along a distribution feeder. In this context, the supervision and control of these generating units through a standardized, flexible and capillary communication infrastructure becomes a key factor in enabling large-scale integration. Present voltage regulation methods adopted in distribution grids using DGPV units are based on the local interaction of each source with the power grid, without exploiting the potential benefits of a wide integration among them. This paper proposes the use of an optimization method for voltage regulation, focused on reactive power injection control, based on a communication architecture model that coordinates the interaction among the inverters of DGPV units. This architecture enables each distributed source to perform in accordance with its operational characteristics and location, while dynamically coordinated by a DGMS (Distributed Generation Management System). The proposed communication infrastructure is based on the connectivity and interoperability requirements established by the international standard IEC 61850 and the IEEE 2030 reference model. A sensitivity analysis regarding the performance of voltage regulation and communication infrastructure, based on a co-simulation of PSCAD and MatLab, shows the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. This work analyses the impact of communication network delay and unavailability in voltage regulation process.
Nuclear reactor pulse tracing using a CdZnTe electro-optic radiation detector
 CdZnTe has previously been shown to operate as an electro-optic radiation detector by utilizing the Pockels effect to measure steady-state nuclear reactor power levels. In the present work, the detector response to reactor power excursion experiments was investigated. Peak power levels during an excursion were predicted to be between 965 MW and 1009 MW using the Fuchs–Nordheim and Fuchs–Hansen models and confirmed with experimental data from the Kansas State University TRIGA Mark II nuclear reactor. The experimental arrangement of the Pockels cell detector includes collimated laser light passing through a transparent birefringent crystal, located between crossed polarizers, and focused upon a photodiode. The birefringent crystal, CdZnTe in this case, is placed in a neutron beam emanating from a nuclear reactor beam port. After obtaining the voltage-dependent Pockels characteristic response curve with a photodiode, neutron measurements were conducted from reactor pulses with the Pockels cell set at the 1/4 and 3/4 wave bias voltages. The detector responses to nuclear reactor pulses were recorded in real-time using data logging electronics, each showing a sharp increase in photodiode current for the 1/4 wave bias, and a sharp decrease in photodiode current for the 3/4 wave bias. The polarizers were readjusted to equal angles in which the maximum light transmission occurred at 0 V bias, thereby, inverting the detector response to reactor pulses. A high sample rate oscilloscope was also used to more accurately measure the FWHM of the pulse from the electro-optic detector, 64 ms, and is compared to the experimentally obtained FWHM of 16.0 ms obtained with the 10B-lined counter.
Tracking algorithm for the gain of the phase modulator in closed-loop optical voltage sensors
 The accuracy and scale factor of the optical voltage sensor are considerably affected by the gain drift of the phase modulator induced by temperature fluctuation. In this paper, we present a tracking system for the gain drift of the phase modulator based on four-state modulation which provides a significant improvement in the performance of the optical voltage sensor. We analyze the influence of the main closed-loop error of optical voltage sensor on the tracking system. The analysis results indicate that the main closed-loop error causes uncertain parameter and external disturbance for the tracking system. Then the model of the tracking system for the gain of the phase modulator is transformed into a dynamic system with uncertainty and stochastic disturbance by substitution of variable. The tracking system is accurately designed considering the main closed-loop error. To insure the tracking system achieves good transient performance, the closed-loop poles of the tracking system are constrained to locate in a desired circular region, while the gain error is mean-square exponentially stable via the robust control. The experiments show that the tracking system realizes precise compensation for the gain drift of the phase modulator.
Non-contact methods for thermal properties measurement
 Many of the renewable and sustainable energy technologies employ novel nanomaterials. For instance, thermal storage and thermoelectric conversion are in constant progress due to the emergence of new structures such as carbon-based materials, bulk nanostructures, 2D novel materials or nanowires. Thermal properties play a significant role to all these energy technologies as key parameters to evaluate the performance and efficiency of those materials in the final device. Understanding the effects of nanostructuring on thermal properties becomes critical, since a reduction in the thermal conductivity due to increased phonon scattering at interfaces is usually expected. Therefore, the determination of the thermal properties remains a critical aspect of material development effort, and measurement techniques are continuously developed or improved. Among those, non-contact heating methods are of importance since they bypass a frequent source of errors characteristic to contact-based thermal measurements, namely the thermal contact resistances, which can be dominant in nanoscale materials. Non-contact heating techniques are usually based on photothermal phenomenon, where heating is generated typically by incident radiation. This paper reviews non-contact heating measurement methods, providing an overview of basic principles for measurement along with associated theoretical model necessary for data reduction and their main applications. The techniques are categorized as time domain and frequency domain techniques, where the thermal response of the sample under study is analyzed as a function of time and frequency, respectively. Both types of methods study the transient response of the sample from a pulsed or modulated heating, and typical measurement output is thermal diffusivity. In addition, other non-contact techniques are also discussed, such as those based on steady-state response, from which the thermal conductivity is directly obtained, or those using AFM probe in the non-contact mode. Finally, main advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are summarized along with their associated uncertainties.
PhoDAGs Enable Optical Control of Diacylglycerol-Sensitive Transient Receptor Potential Channels
 Diacylglycerol-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play crucial roles in a wide variety of biological processes and systems, but their activation mechanism is not well understood. We describe an optical toolkit by which activation and deactivation of these ion channels can be controlled with unprecedented speed and precision through light stimuli. We show that the photoswitchable diacylglycerols PhoDAG-1 and PhoDAG-3 enable rapid photoactivation of two DAG-sensitive TRP channels, Trpc2 and TRPC6, upon stimulation with UV-A light, whereas exposure to blue light terminates channel activation. PhoDAG photoconversion can be applied in heterologous expression systems, in native cells, and even in mammalian tissue slices. Combined laser scanning-controlled photoswitching and Ca2+ imaging enables both large-scale mapping of TRP channel-mediated neuronal activation and localized mapping in small cellular compartments. Light-switchable PhoDAGs provide an important advance to explore the pathophysiological relevance of DAG-sensitive TRP channels in the maintenance of body homeostasis.
Application of the Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter with Augmented State in the Fiber Optic Gyroscope
 The interferometric fiber optic gyroscope (IFOG) is a nonlinear response system. The noise, which results from the optic and electrical parts of the gyro for the environmental disturbance, includes both nonlinear noise and additive noise, and degrades the bias stability of the gyro. In this paper, the nonlinear state equation about the closed-loop IFOG is deduced from analyzing the sources, characteristic and effect of noise, and then the scaled unscented Kalman filter (SUKF) with augmented state is presented to reduce the noise. The experiment showed that: by adjusting SUKF parameters, it evidently decreases the standard deviation and Allan variance of the bias stability. Therefore this algorithm achieves better performance of filtering and improves effectively the bias stability of the gyro.
A rail vibration test and analysis method for the electromagnetic launching process
 During the electromagnetic launching (EML) process, rail vibrations occur due to the electromagnetic force generated by an acute current. These vibrations result in a reduced launch velocity and decreased launch efficiency. To measure the vibration amplitude of a rail accurately and to analyze the internal relationships between current strength, rail material and vibrations, a small transient vibration in a strong electromagnetic field was studied in this paper. Related experiments were also performed on the test system. Fiber-optic displacement sensors were used to collect vibration data at key locations along the rail. Using virtual instrument technology, a software platform was designed that displayed the vibration waveform and analyzed the time, frequency domain and other parameters. We collected data on the vibration response and the modal parameters of the rail and determined the natural frequencies of the electromagnetic launch system by performing a modal analysis of its vibrations and dynamic responses that combined experimental and theoretical methods. Methods of optimizing the structure’s vibration and dynamic response and of assessing the damage to it could be studied further on the basis of the results described in this paper.
An integrated platform for simultaneous multi-well field potential recording and Fura-2-based calcium transient ratiometry in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes
 Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are available from various sources and they are being evaluated for safety testing. Several platforms are available offering different assay principles and read-out parameters: patch-clamp and field potential recording, imaging or photometry, impedance measurement, and recording of contractile force. Routine use will establish which assay principle and which parameters best serve the intended purpose. We introduce a combination of field potential recording and calcium ratiometry from spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes as a novel assay providing a complementary read-out parameter set. Field potential recording is performed using a commercial multi-well multi-electrode array platform. Calcium ratiometry is performed using a fiber optic illumination and silicon avalanche photodetectors. Data condensation and statistical analysis are designed to enable statistical inference of differences and equivalence with regard to a solvent control. Simultaneous recording of field potentials and calcium transients from spontaneously beating monolayers was done in a nine-well format. Calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine) and a blocker of calcium store release (ryanodine) can be recognized and discriminated based on the calcium transient signal. An agonist of L-type calcium channels, FPL 64176, increased and prolonged the calcium transient, whereas BAY K 8644, another L-type calcium channel agonist, had no effect. Both FPL 64176 and various calcium channel antagonists have chronotropic effects, which can be discriminated from typical “chronotropic” compounds, like (±)isoprenaline (positive) and arecaidine propargyl ester (negative), based on their effects on the calcium transient. Despite technical limitations in temporal resolution and exact matching of composite calcium transient with the field potential of a subset of cells, the combined recording platform enables a refined interpretation of the field potential recording and a more reliable identification of drug effects on calcium handling.
Feasibility study of the application of optical voltage and current sensors and an arrayed waveguide grating for aero-electrical systems
 In this paper we present, for the first time, the hybrid fiber-optic voltage and current sensors interrogated using an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) device. Due to the excellent dynamic capabilities of an AWG-based interrogator and its improved robustness, the proposed system would be suitable for voltage and current monitoring within an aircraft electrical system. The voltage sensor comprises a multilayer piezoelectric stack, acting as a voltage-to-strain transducer, and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) used to convert voltage induced strain changes within the stack into wavelength shifts. These wavelength shifts are then analyzed by an AWG. To measure current, the same sensor type is used to monitor a specially designed ferrite-core current transformer. Alternatively, a magnetostrictive transducer is employed instead of piezoelectric stack. It is shown that the system is capable of measuring variable frequency of voltage and current waveforms, typical of those anticipated in the next generation aero-electric power systems. It is also demonstrated that the system can be used for voltage and current harmonic analysis and power quality measurement in such networks.
Voltage balancing of islanded microgrids using a time-domain technique
 In this paper, voltage balancing and frequency control of converter-fed, islanded microgrids, using a novel time-domain technique which has not been applied for such applications is discussed in detail. In particular, the connection of single-phase loads to the islanded microgrid causes voltage unbalance and this is eliminated by supplying the negative-sequence component of the voltage from the converter. The negative sequence components of the voltage and current are extracted using the aforementioned time-domain technique. The simulations are carried out in RSCAD™ and experimental results are provided to validate the concept.
Test and Measurement of Fiber Optic Transceivers
 Time-domain waveform is analyzed to determine how well a transmitter carries information. This chapter focuses on testing of the transmitter and the receiver. Most optical communication waveforms are viewed using a wide-bandwidth sampling oscilloscope. The internal electronics of the sampler circuits in a wide-bandwidth oscilloscope produce a small amount of noise. An oscilloscope channel response with a gradual roll off produces a faithful output waveform than the oscilloscope with the wider but more abrupt frequency response. This happens even with a comparably lower bandwidth. Mask testing is automated to take special action when mask violations occur. Waveform acquisition can be halted, violating waveform can be captured and saved, or tests can be run to capture only a specific number of waveforms regardless of the number of failures. This leads to interesting modifications of the standard mask test process. Mask failures typically occur when the transmitter waveform is at the extremes of its performance.
A model of the mammalian optic nerve fibre based on experimental data
 Several experimental data about membrane dynamics and pharmacological sensitivities of optic nerve axons have been published. The present work summarizes these data and computer simulations have been used to develop a model of the mammalian optic nerve fibre. The ionic currents description were derived from existing membrane models and particularly from a model of the somatic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) impulse generation. However, original equations had to be modified to match experimental data, which suggests that in RGCs, axonal and somatic ion channel expression are different. The new model is consistent with recent experimental results about optic nerve axonal excitability.
Spatial and temporal thermal analysis of acousto-optic deflectors using finite element analysis model
 Thermal effects greatly influence the optical properties of the acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). Thermal analysis plays an important role in modern AOD design. However, the lack of an effective method of analysis limits the prediction in the thermal performance. In this paper, we propose a finite element analysis model to analyze the thermal effects of a TeO2-based AOD. Both transducer heating and acoustic absorption are considered as thermal sources. The anisotropy of sound propagation is taken into account for determining the acoustic absorption. Based on this model, a transient thermal analysis is employed using ANSYS software. The spatial temperature distributions in the crystal and the temperature changes over time are acquired. The simulation results are validated by experimental results. The effect of heat source and heat convection on temperature distribution is discussed. This numerical model and analytical method of thermal analysis would be helpful in the thermal design and practical applications of AODs.
Temperature and fiber optic spectroscopy composition measurements of heated propanol–acetone droplets
 Time-dependent temperatures and compositions within individual fiber-supported droplets initially from about 2–3 mm in diameter were investigated. In the experiments, droplets were composed of mixtures of 1-propanol and acetone. The droplets evaporated in room air, where the air was heated by placing an electrically heated coil underneath the droplets. The experiments employed thin optical fibers to carry light from a UV–vis light source into and out of a droplet. The time-dependent UV absorption spectrum of the liquid between the fiber ends was measured using a spectrometer coupled to one of the fibers. This spectrum yielded real-time information on the composition of the liquid. Droplet temperatures were simultaneously measured using a thermocouple that was immersed into the liquid. Results demonstrate that droplet evaporation follows a multi-stage process and that acetone is preferentially gasified from a droplet.
Standards for digital recorders for measurements in high-voltage impulse tests
 The background to the first standards for digital recorders for high-voltage impulse measurements is reviewed briefly. The emphasis in the first issues is given and the import of the decisions made in these early documents presented. The changes in the latest revision of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Std. 1122-1998 are reviewed briefly and contrasted with the approach in the latest Committee Draft for Voting on the revision of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Document 1083-1. The importance of the changes in these documents is discussed. New work in the field is summarized and recent developments in digital recorders are discussed. The present status of digital measurements is summarized and proposals for future improvements to the standards are put forward.
Current and Voltage Transformers
 This chapter describes the properties of current transformers (CTs) and voltage transformers (VTs), and how to specify them for particular applications. Current and voltage transformers are required to transform high currents and voltages into more manageable quantities for measurement, protection, and control. A current transformer is used to transform a primary current quantity in terms of its magnitude and phase to a secondary value, so that in normal conditions the secondary value is substantially proportional to the primary value. VTs are required to maintain specified accuracy limits down to 2% of rated voltage for protection purposes.
Voltage-sensitive dyes measure potential changes in axons and glia of the frog optic nerve
 Changes in dye absorption and fluorescence produced by electrical stimulation were measured in frog optic nerves stained with voltage-sensitive dyes. Following a single maximal stimulus applied through a suction electrode, the change in transmitted light intensity consisted of two components: one representing an axonal compound action potential and the second a slow depolarizing afterpotential which appeared to arise from the glial cells. The following results support this interpretation: (1) during a train of stimuli the depolarizing potentials sum and can exceed 80% of the initial spike amplitude while the spike amplitude itself remains essentially constant. Thus, the axons cannot have undergone significant depolarization during the train. (2) Optical recordings with simultaneous microelectrode recordings from the glial cells indicate that the change in glial membrane potential during the train has a time-course similar to that of the slow optical response. We conclude that voltage-sensitive dyes can monitor potential changes in both neurons and glia.
Fiber-Optic Transceivers
 This chapter discusses the operation and application of fiber-optic transceivers in the physical layer with innovative tendencies for integration of more data transport functions into these components or for a significant reduction of size and power consumption. The transmitter unit and the receiver unit are connected together to the transmission medium, either multimode or single-mode fiber. Contrary to typical telecom applications with single-fiber-optic connectors at the ends of fiber pigtails, transceivers characteristically have duplex optical receptacles at one side of the housing, which fit to the corresponding duplex connectors. Optical interface involves the meeting of two objects. In the case of the optical interface, the fiber comes together with the optical transceiver elements: the transmitter diode and the receiver diode receptacle unit. The operating link demands that the mechanical and optical properties of these two objects match. These attributes are defined in various standards to maintain a reliable interoperability of products of different manufacturers.
A shape memory alloy based on photodiode for optoelectronic applications
 A photodiode was fabricated as a Schottky contact using Cu-Al-Mn shape memory alloy and p-Si substrate. The alloy was characterized by some characterization techniques such as (SEM), XRD and DSC. The electrical and photovoltaic properties of the prepared Schottky diode were investigated under various illumination intensities and frequencies. The illumination dependent I-V measurements showed that the diode exhibited a photovoltaic behavior. The electronic parameters of the diode were obtained using various theoretical models. The photo transient behavior of the diode was analyzed under solar light. The admittance measurements indicate that the diode exhibits a dispersive capacitance behavior. The results indicate that the Schottky diode could be used in optic device applications.
The optic nerve: A model for axon–glial interactions
 The rodent optic nerve is a model tissue for the physiological investigation of axonal–glial interactions in a typical CNS white matter tract. There is strong evidence that nerve transmission is maintained by a considerable degree of dynamic signalling between axons and glia through a variety of mechanisms, such as regulation of the ionic environment, energy metabolism and calcium signalling. This review focuses on the methods used to examine axonal and glial functions and interactions, primarily in the rodent optic nerve. Techniques encompass intracellular microelectrodes, sucrose- and grease-gap recordings of membrane potentials, suction electrode to measure compound action potentials, the use of ion-sensitive electrodes, patch clamping and imaging. An overview of the advantages and drawbacks of each technique is given and the application of each to the understanding glial and axonal physiology is briefly discussed.
Feasibility of Electrical Resistance Tomography for measurements of liquid holdup distribution in a trickle bed reactor
 Trickle bed reactors (TBRs) are widely used in chemical and oil industries. Owing to complex nature of flow in TBRs, measurements of local liquid holdup distribution are rather limited. While several non-invasive measurement techniques have been used to measure liquid distribution in TBRs, the applicability of Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) for quantitative measurement of liquid holdup distribution is not yet verified. In the present work, measurements of local liquid distribution in a laboratory-scale TBR are carried out using ERT for trickle to transition flow regimes. The time-averaged liquid holdup distributions measured using the ERT and BLC methods were compared using the liquid maldistribution factor to demonstrate the feasibility of the ERT to measure liquid holdup distribution. The effect of liquid-distributor configurations (semi-uniform, local and one-sided) was investigated on the radial liquid distribution at different axial locations of TBR. Further, the ability of ERT to measure time-resolved local liquid distribution was verified using multi-point conductivity sensors for artificially created pulsing flow. Also, the comparison of liquid pulse width with multi-point conductivity sensor measurements was carried out and of the dispersion of liquid pulse along the length of TBR was analyzed. The ERT measurements were performed to quantify the effects of gas and liquid flow rates, and particle size on the local liquid holdup. The void-scale flow structure measured by multi-point conductivity sensors was used to analyze the macroscopic (bed-scale) liquid holdup distribution measured by ERT. Thus, the comparison of ERT measurements with time-averaged BLC and time-resolved multi-point conductivity sensor measurements is important to establish the applicability of ERT for quantitative spatial and in particular the time-resolved measurements of liquid holdup in TBRs.
Imaging Voltage in Neurons
 In the last decades, imaging membrane potential has become a fruitful approach to study neural circuits, especially in invertebrate preparations with large, resilient neurons. At the same time, particularly in mammalian preparations, voltage imaging methods suffer from poor signal to noise and secondary side effects, and they fall short of providing single-cell resolution when imaging of the activity of neuronal populations. As an introduction to these techniques, we briefly review different voltage imaging methods (including organic fluorophores, SHG chromophores, genetic indicators, hybrid, nanoparticles, and intrinsic approaches) and illustrate some of their applications to neuronal biophysics and mammalian circuit analysis. We discuss their mechanisms of voltage sensitivity, from reorientation, electrochromic, or electro-optical phenomena to interaction among chromophores or membrane scattering, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings, commenting on the outlook for development of novel voltage imaging methods.
Mass, Force, and Torque Measurement
 This chapter covers the three separate subjects of mass, force, and torque measurement. Mass measurement, and the related quantity of weight measurement, is considered first, and the three distinct ways of measuring mass using respectively a load cell, a spring balance, and one of several instruments working on the mass-balance principle are explored. Moving onto the force measurement, it is noted that transient forces can be measured by an accelerometer, whereas static forces are measured either by a vibrating wire sensor or by a special form of load cell. Looking next to the torque measurement, the chapter reveals that the two main current methods for measuring torque are to measure the induced strain in a rotating shaft or to measure the torque optically, while also mentioning two older and lesser-used techniques in the form of firstly measuring the reaction forces in the bearings supporting a rotating shaft and secondly using a device called the Prony brake. Sections covering the calibration of mass, force, and torque sensors are also provided in the chapter.
Investigation of subcooled and saturated boiling heat transfer mechanisms, instabilities, and transient flow regime maps for large length-to-diameter ratio micro-channel heat sinks
 This study investigates the interfacial behavior and heat transfer mechanisms associated with flow boiling of R-134a in a micro-channel test module. The test module features 100 of 1 × 1 mm2 square micro-channels. Large length of micro-channels used (609.6 mm) is especially important to capturing broad axial variations of both flow and heat transfer behavior. The fluid is supplied to the test module in subcooled state to enable assessment of both the subcooled boiling and saturated boiling regions. The study employs a combination of temperature measurements along the test module and high-speed video to explore crucial details of the flow, including dominant flow regimes, flow instabilities, and downstream dryout effects. It is shown that, unlike macro-channel flows, where flow regimes can be clearly demarcated, flow regimes in micro-channels are associated with transient fluctuations that are induced by flow instabilities. The dominant flow behavior and associated dryout effects are characterized with the aid of a new transient flow regime map and a dryout map, respectively. Two sub-regions of the subcooled boiling region, partially developed boiling (PDB) and fully developed boiling (FDB), are examined relative to dominant interfacial and heat transfer mechanisms, and a previous correlation is identified for accurate prediction of the heat transfer coefficient for both PDB and FDB. The saturated boiling region is shown to consist of three separate sub-regions: nucleate boiling dominated for qualities below 0.3, combined nucleate and convective boiling for qualities between 0.3 and 0.5, and convective boiling dominated for qualities above 0.5. Above 0.5, dryout effects begin to take effect, causing a gradual decline in the heat transfer coefficient followed downstream by a more severe decline. A previous correlation is identified for prediction of the heat transfer coefficient in the saturated boiling region.
CdTe quantum dot dispersed ferroelectric liquid crystal: Transient memory with faster optical response and quenching of photoluminescence
 In the present study, the effect of dispersing Octadecylamine capped Cadmium Telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs) on the memory behaviour, physical parameters and dielectric relaxations of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) W-327 with the variation of dopant concentration and applied voltage has been examined. Significant changes have been observed in visible light absorbance, photoluminescence (PL), spontaneous polarization, optical response and relative permittivity of the FLC material with the addition of QDs. An average of 19% (Mix.1) and 28% (Mix.2) fastening of optical response in QDs dispersed FLC mixtures was one of the remarkable findings. Enhancement in visible absorbance along with the quenching in PL intensity has also been noticed in FLC/QD mixtures in comparison to pure FLC. The study of tan δ curves confirms the reduction of ionic impurities in the presence of QDs. Pure FLC as well as FLC/QD mixtures show time dependent memory effects. The memory behaviour of mixtures significantly depends upon the concentration of dopant CdTe. The memory effect was confirmed with the help of dielectric spectroscopy, polarizing optical micrographs and electro-optical study. The observed memory effect has been attributed to minimization of the depolarization field and ionic charges. The QDs dispersed FLC plays a major role to enhance memory effects by trapping the impurity ions under the application of bias voltage. These studies would be helpful to provide an idea for ionic impurity free memory devices having micro-second optical response and in security coded transmission.
Optic nerve oxygenation
 The oxygen tension of the optic nerve is regulated by the intraocular pressure and systemic blood pressure, the resistance in the blood vessels and oxygen consumption of the tissue. The oxygen tension is autoregulated and moderate changes in intraocular pressure or blood pressure do not affect the optic nerve oxygen tension. If the intraocular pressure is increased above 40 mmHg or the ocular perfusion pressure decreased below 50 mmHg the autoregulation is overwhelmed and the optic nerve becomes hypoxic. A disturbance in oxidative metabolism in the cytochromes of the optic nerve can be seen at similar levels of perfusion pressure. The levels of perfusion pressure that lead to optic nerve hypoxia in the laboratory correspond remarkably well to the levels that increase the risk of glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy in human glaucoma patients. The risk for progressive optic nerve atrophy in human glaucoma patients is six times higher at a perfusion pressure of 30 mmHg, which corresponds to a level where the optic nerve is hypoxic in experimental animals, as compared to perfusion pressure levels above 50 mmHg where the optic nerve is normoxic. Medical intervention can affect optic nerve oxygen tension. Lowering the intraocular pressure tends to increase the optic nerve oxygen tension, even though this effect may be masked by the autoregulation when the optic nerve oxygen tension and perfusion pressure is in the normal range. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors increase the optic nerve oxygen tension through a mechanism of vasodilatation and lowering of the intraocular pressure. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition reduces the removal of CO2 from the tissue and the CO2 accumulation induces vasodilatation resulting in increased blood flow and improved oxygen supply. This effect is inhibited by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, which indicates that prostaglandin metabolism plays a role. Laboratory studies suggest that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors might be useful for medical treatment of optic nerve and retinal ischemia, potentially in diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. However, clinical trials and needed to test this hypotheses.
Acousto-optic laser chopper based on light diffraction by hypersonic standing waves in lithium niobate single crystal
 The paper presents results on the theoretical and experimental investigations of an acousto-optic modulator based on single crystal lithium niobate. The modulator uses a regime of operation with a standing longitudinal acoustic wave generated in the material along the axis X. The optimum cut in the LiNbO3 crystal has been calculated and it is shown that the highest figure of merit can be obtained in the YZ-plane of the crystal if light propagates not along the crystalline axis Z or Y but at an angle of 37° with respect to the axis Y. Application to the instrument of a harmonic driving electric signal at a frequency included in the range 450–550 MHz resulted in modulation of light intensity and generation of a sequence of laser pulses having repetition frequencies 0.9–1.1 GHz. The efficiency of light diffraction in the examined laser chopper was equal to 7–10% depending on frequency and power at a driving electric power of 1.0 W or higher and a wavelength of light equal to 532 nm. The possibilities to develop a similar acousto-optic modulator but with repetition frequencies up to 10 GHz are discussed.
Testing of fiber optic systems
 This chapter examines the requirements for testing fiber optic cables, optical transmitter, and receiver equipment. Light detectors that are used for power measurement purposes have to be calibrated for the frequency they are to measure. The response time of a detector in a light meter is very slow when compared to the speed of the incoming pulses. The testing of fiber optic equipment and cables is generally carried out before and after the system is installed. There are two main tests that are performed on the transmitting and receiving equipment. The first is to test the transmitter output power. One of the most common tests that are carried out on a fiber optic system is to measure the attenuation of a length of a fiber. The optic fiber type used for calibration purposes is the same optic fiber type that is to be tested for insertion loss. It is suggested that the power meter and the power source must operate at the wavelength that the installed system equipment is to use. The most commonly used and best recognized method of analyzing the state of a fiber optic link is to test it with an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). The OTDR sends a short pulse of light down the fiber, and measures and records the light energy that is reflected back up the fiber. It is found that the OTDR can be used for providing accurate attenuation measurements assuming that the OTDR is of a high quality and is regularly calibrated.
Fibre optic sensor system for void fraction measurement in aqueous two-phase fluids
 An improved method of measuring the void fraction in two-phase mixtures has been developed. This work was part of a three-phase project that included proof-of-principle, design and fabrication, installation and probe use during a series of flow channel test. The sensing method is based on measurement of differences in infrared transmission through liquid water as result of the presence of vapour bubbles in the optical path. The fibre optic system measures void fraction in a small volume along a line-of-sight across the flow channel. This paper covers the design and test of the fibre optic void fraction system, and application results are presented on the measurement of two-phase mixtures in flow channels.
Developmental expression of Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels in the avian hypothalamus
 Specialized hypothalamic neurons integrate the homeostatic balance between food intake and energy expenditure, processes that may become dysregulated during the development of diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic disorders. Shaker family voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1) contribute to the maintenance of resting membrane potential, action potential characteristics, and neurotransmitter release in many populations of neurons, although hypothalamic Kv1 channel expression has been largely unexplored. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from avian hypothalamic brain slices demonstrate a developmental shift in the electrophysiological properties of avian arcuate nucleus neurons, identifying an increase in outward ionic current that corresponds with action potential maturation. Additionally, RT-PCR experiments identified the early expression of Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.5 mRNA in the embryonic avian hypothalamus, suggesting that these channels may underlie the electrophysiological changes observed in these neurons. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis on intact microdissections of embryonic hypothalamic tissue revealed a concomitant increase in Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 gene expression at key electrophysiological time points during development. This study is the first to demonstrate hypothalamic mRNA expression of Kv1 channels in developing avian embryos and may suggest a role for voltage-gated ion channel regulation in the physiological patterning of embryonic hypothalamic circuits governing energy homeostasis.
Fibre-optic probe hydrophone for ultrasonic and shock-wave measurements in water
 Aimed at lithotripter acoustic output measurements, a new fibre-optic probe hydrophone overcomes most of the problems involved with the use of piezoelectric hydrophone technology in non-linear ultrasonic and shock-wave fields. The fibre-optic principle allows for extremely wide bandwidth (larger than 1 GHz) and superior electromagnetic shielding. Contrary to hitherto existing hydrophones a high cavitation threshold at the water-silica interface provides undistorted detection of strong rarefractional pulse pressures. Considering pure compression there is good agreement between maximum pulse pressure derived from fibre-optic hydrophone theory and the corresponding amplitudes obtained from acoustically calibrated PVDF membrane and needle hydrophones.
The fiber-optic gyroscope: Challenges to become the ultimate rotation-sensing technology
 Taking advantage of the development of optical-fiber communication technologies, the fiber-optic gyroscope started to be investigated in the mid 1970s, opening the way for a fully solid-state rotation sensor. It was firstly seen as dedicated to medium-grade applications, but today, it reaches strategic-grade performance and surpasses its well-established competitor, the ring-laser gyroscope, in terms of bias noise and long-term stability. Further progresses remain possible, the challenge being the ultimate inertial navigation performance of one nautical mile per month corresponding to a long-term bias stability of 10−5°/h.
The thermal measurement system for the SPIDER beam source
 The SPIDER test facility is under construction in Padova to verify the ion beam characteristics and to test the beam source operation under conditions consistent with the ITER neutral beam requirements. Thermal measurements will be performed on the beam source by installing thermocouples that will be used for different purposes: (a) diagnostic, such as for the reconstruction of the thermal map on the component surface for the evaluation of the thermal load distribution, plasma generation and beam extraction uniformity, (b) operational for the recognition of different experiment conditions such as the determination of the beginning of plasma extraction and acceleration related to caesium monolayer deposition, and (c) protective, for the verification of the components thermal reliability under the allowed maximum temperatures. The thermal measurements will be made with N type thermocouples based on mineral insulated cables 0.8 mm outer diameter, with grounded (not insulated) junctions. This specific thermocouple type guarantees minimal rise time and also ensures that the electric potential of the thermal sensor is always the same as that of the component, thus avoiding dangerous over-voltages in particular during grid-to-grid breakdowns. Rationale of the thermocouples design and layout is presented in this work. The paper also describes the thermocouple fixing systems that have been developed in detail and tested with prototypes in order to guarantee the thermal contact between the sensing junction and the component material. The signal isolation and conditioning systems have been designed considering the different voltages of the components with respect to ground and the response time of thermal sensors. Furthermore, voltage measurements integrated with thermal measurements will be acquired in order to develop a robust measurement system by correlating signals obtained from different transducers.
Double tungsten coil atomic absorption spectrometer based on an acousto-optic tunable filter
 An atomic absorption spectrometer based on a quartz acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) monochromator operating in the 271–453 nm range, is described. The instrument was tailored to study the formation and evolution of electrothermal atomic cloud induced either by one or two tungsten coils. The spectrometer also includes a fast response programmable photomultiplier module for data acquisition, and a power supply capable of driving two parallel tungsten coils independently. The atomization cell herein described was manufactured in PTFE and presents a new design with reduced size. Synchronization between the instant of power delivering to start the atomization process and the detection was achieved, allowing for monitoring the atomization and thermal events synchronously and in real time. Absorption signals can be sampled at a rate of a few milliseconds, compatible with the fast phenomena that occur with electrothermal metallic atomizers. The instrument performance was preliminarily evaluated by monitoring the absorption of radiation of atomic clouds produced by standard solutions containing chromium or lead. Its quantitative performance was evaluated by using Cr aqueous solutions, resulting in detection limits as low as 0.24 μg L− 1, and a relative standard deviation of 3%.
The transient characteristics of cloud cavitating flow over a flexible hydrofoil
 The objective of this paper is to investigate the two-phase flow structure of cloud cavitation over a flexible hydrofoil with particular emphasis on cavitating flow-induced vibration and the cavity shedding dynamics via combined experimental and numerical studies. The experimental studies are conducted in a closed-loop cavitation tunnel using a simultaneous sampling technique and the numerical investigations are performed using a hybrid coupled fluid structure interaction model. Results are presented for a modified NACA66 hydrofoil made of POM Polyacetate and good agreement can be obtained between the numerical and experimental results. The predicted cavitation behaviors, including the cavity growth, break-off and collapse, agree fairly well with the experiment. The vibration velocity goes up with the growth of the attached cavity and the break off of the cloud cavity induces some fluctuations of the vibration velocity. For the cavity shedding dynamics, the cavity partially collapses with the vibration and breaks into several medium-scale cloud cavities accompanied with complex interaction between the counter-rotating vortexes. Good agreement can be obtained between the predicted and measured vibration amplitudes, with the dominant flow-induced vibration frequency in accordance with the cavity shedding frequency and other two vibration frequencies corresponding to the natural frequencies of the first bending and twisting mode respectively. The one-dimensional analytical model is applied to better illustrate the physical mechanism of the cavitating flow induced pressure pulsation. The results show that the transient cavitating behaviors lead to the periodic pressure fluctuation on the hydrofoil. The one-dimensional model can track the main features of the pressure fluctuations, which are mainly derived from the cavity volume acceleration.
Impact source identification in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate by using embedded fiber optic acoustic emission sensors
 This paper demonstrates the use of four embedded fiber optic acoustic emission sensors (FOAESs) to identify the impact source of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate. The optical waveguide method and computer simulation were both applied to explain the principle of FOAES, which proved that any one of the two output terminals of FOAES was able to reveal frequency response characteristics of stress waves. The response characteristics of the FOAES to the stress waves were calibrated and discussed for comparisons of before-and-after embedded in the CFRP plate. Propagation velocities of stress wave depending on the direction in the CFRP plate were measured by FOAESs as the information for impact source identification. A simple and efficient algorithm based on the intersection of hyperbolic curves was presented to estimate the impact source location. An automatic monitoring system with the tailored program of localization algorithm was introduced for online real-time impact source identification. Experiments of impact source localization were achieved by using the FOAESs array mounted on the surface and embedded in the CFRP plate. The measured results agree well with the actual impact sources in the CFRP plate embedded with FOAESs. Furthermore, the research of composites structures embedded with FOAESs is conductive to developing the intelligent integration of structural health monitoring (SHM).
In-plane vibration characterization of microelectromechanical systems using acousto-optic modulated partially incoherent stroboscopic imaging
 A technique using acousto-optic modulated partially incoherent stroboscopic imaging for measurement of in-plane motion of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is presented. Vibration measurement is allowed by using flashes of the partially incoherent light source to freeze the positions of the microstructure at 12 equally spaced phases of the vibration period. The first-order diffracted beam taken out by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) from the light beam of a laser is made partially incoherent by a rotating diffuser and then serves as the stroboscopic light source. Both the MEMS excitation signal and the flash control signal are provided by a dual-channel function generator. The main advantage of this measurement method is the absence of a stroboscopic generator and a high speed digital camera. Microscale prototypes are fabricated and tested. Quantitative estimates of the harmonic responses of the prototypes are obtained from the recorded images. The results agree with those obtained with a commercial MEMS motion analyzerTM with relative errors less than 2%.
Second Harmonic Generation in Neurons: Electro-Optic Mechanism of Membrane Potential Sensitivity
 Second harmonic generation (SHG) from membrane-bound chromophores can be used to image membrane potential in neurons. We investigate the biophysical mechanism responsible for the SHG voltage sensitivity of the styryl dye FM 4-64 in pyramidal neurons from mouse neocortical slices. SHG signals are exquisitely sensitive to the polarization of the incident laser light. Using this polarization sensitivity in two complementary approaches, we estimate a ∼36° tilt angle of the chromophore to the membrane normal. Changes in membrane potential do not affect the polarization of the SHG signal. The voltage response of FM 4-64 is faster than 1 ms and does not reverse sign when imaged at either side of its absorption peak. We conclude that FM 4-64 senses membrane potential through an electro-optic mechanism, without significant chromophore membrane reorientation, redistribution, or spectral shift.
Use of pattern electroretinography to differentiate acute optic neuritis from acute anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
 The transient pattern electroretinogram (PERG) was recorded from 16 patients with acute neuritis and from 13 patients with acute non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). All patients were tested within 35 days from the the onset of visual symptoms and all had significant central visual field abnormalities in their affected eyes as quantified by automated perimetry. Analysis of the PERGs showed that the amplitude of the N95 peak was abnormally reduced for each eye affected with AION while it remained normal in optic neuritis. No significant alteration in P50 amplitude was observed in either condition. The loss of N95 amplitude in AION was highly correlated with the average depth of visual field loss (in decibels) within a radius of 10° of fixation. These results suggest that PERG could be used early in the course of optic neuropathy to distinguish optic neuritis from AION in those cases for which the diagnosis is still uncertain after the clinical examination.
Characterizations of solid-liquid interface in a wet-mate subsea HVDC connector
 Wet-mate connectors represent essential and technically challenging components in a subsea HVDC system. In this paper, systematic characterizations of solid-liquid insulation system implemented in a Wet-Mate subsea connector are presented with special focus on the interfaces. First, conduction in the liquid gap was studied using the current-voltage characterization and the Kerr electro-optic field mapping to establish the correlation between conduction and DC field grading for various electrode gap configurations and oil types. Secondly, Kerr electro-optic field sensing was extended to solid-liquid interfaces for model Wet-Mate connectors. Studies suggest that DC field grading in solid-liquid insulation particularly along the interface is influenced by regimes of conduction depending on the electrode configuration, gap separation, polarity, oil type, moisture and contaminants, and such dependences are further affected by the DC properties of hybrid solid-liquid insulations. Exemplar modelling studies conducted on representative design configurations indicate that this comprehensive basic study could provide insight into the tailoring of solid-liquid interfaces with low field distortion under quasi steady-state and polarity reversal operations for safe design and optimization of DC Wet-Mate connectors.
Flupirtine as Neuroprotective Add-On Therapy in Autoimmune Optic Neuritis
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that results in persistent impairment in young adults. During chronic progressive disease stages, there is a strong correlation between neurodegeneration and disability. Current therapies fail to prevent progression of neurological impairment during these disease stages. Flupirtine, a drug approved for oral use in patients suffering from chronic pain, was used in a rat model of autoimmune optic neuritis and significantly increased the survival of retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. When flupirtine was combined with interferon-β, an established immunomodulatory therapy for MS, visual functions of the animals were improved during the acute phase of optic neuritis. Furthermore, flupirtine protected retinal ganglion cells from degeneration in a noninflammatory animal model of optic nerve transection. Although flupirtine was shown previously to increase neuronal survival by Bcl-2 up-regulation, this mechanism does not appear to play a role in flupirtine-mediated protection of retinal ganglion cells either in vitro or in vivo. Instead, we showed through patch-clamp investigations that the activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels is involved in flupirtine-mediated neuroprotection. Considering the few side effects reported in patients who receive long-term flupirtine treatment for chronic pain, our results indicate that this drug is an interesting candidate for further evaluation of its neuroprotective potential in MS.
Progressive enhancement of alpha activity and visual function in patients with optic neuropathy: A two-week repeated session alternating current stimulation study
 Repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) can improve visual deficits in patients with optic nerve damage. Recent retrospective results suggest that rtACS enhances oscillatory brain activity. The exact mechanisms of rtACS are unclear and little is known about possibly frequency-specific neural-plastic mechanisms. An association between bandwidth-confined neural-entrainment and vision recovery maximization could offer a novel therapeutic option for patients with optic neuropathy. The goal of this prospective open-label study was to investigate if the enhancement of rhythmic brain activity over 10 days of consecutive rtACS stimulation is associated with visual field recovery. The secondary goal was to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms related to frequency dependent adaptive plasticity. 18 Patients with visual field impairments resulting from pre-chiasmatic partial optic nerve damage received rtACS on 10 consecutive days. Daily, subject-specific treatment parameters (<500 μA, 9–37 Hz, 25–40 min/day) were defined and EEG-spectra collected prior to and after rtACS. Visual field data was collected at day 1 and 10. The change of spectral-power in classic bandwidths were investigated and correlated with visual field deficit recovery. After 10 days of rtACS alpha-power over bilateral occipital electrodes was significantly larger than at baseline (FTime x alpha-powerp < 0.01). This effect was progressive over subsequent days of stimulation (cubic-fit, R2 0.70, RMSE 0.008). Perimetric results improved significantly, but they were not associated with changes in alpha-synchronization. rtACS can induce cumulative bandwidth-confined changes in brain rhythms over multiple sessions. These findings are in line with the notion of brain-state dependent [1] and bandwidth-confined entrainment [2] as well as rtACS facilitated visual recovery [3].
Pipeline flow measurement using real-time imaging
 Flow measurements, in particular water flow pressures, are topics of great interest since the issue has an important impact on our daily life. Flow measurements can be performed by means of different devices and instruments. But, in some cases, instead of measuring in direct way the flow, it could be necessary to have pressure by means of dedicated sensors and transducers. In case of hazardous liquids, as suggested by anti-explosion liquids, any measure must be adopted to guarantee measurement and conveying in a safety conditions. So a contactless flow measurement could be a good solution thanks to the use of video-measurements. The paper points out an experimental design and construction of a real-time system for measuring frames of water flow to be composed for determining velocity and changes. This system is suitable for pipeline grids and waterworks where it is difficult to install appropriate devices for the purposes.
Prospects for Fibre Bragg Gratings and Fabry-Perot Interferometers in fibre-optic vibration sensing
 Vibration monitoring of machinery is reducing the overall operating costs of industrial plants. Conventional vibration sensors, based on capacitive or piezoelectric principles, are limited in application due to the problem of electrical isolation. Fibre-optic based instrumentation is thus an attractive alternative method of vibration measurement in the vicinity of electrical substation. This paper discusses several techniques of vibration sensing using optical fibre technology and assesses their potential for use on electromechanical equipment. Firstly an overview of sensor based on In-Fibre Bragg Gratings is presented, and its potential for the measurement of strain and vibration is assessed. Secondly, vibration sensing using fibre-optic intensity-based measurement is presented and then Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) for vibration sensing is critically reviewed. Of these, the FPI is the most attractive since it can easily be configured within a reflective fibre-optic probe. However, reported FPI sensors have been highly sensitive to measurement errors caused by mechanical vibration, temperature, and acoustic waves. This paper reviews technological developments of FPI to vibration sensing in extreme electromechanical environments and also for non-contact measurement. Finally this paper presents an overview of dual-wavelength technique for assessment of vibration signature.
Fast turn-on of an NMOS ESD protection transistor: measurements and simulations
 The transient turn-on of the parasitic bipolar transistor of an NMOS transistor was studied. The voltages appearing at internal nodes of protection and functional circuit after application of 350 ps rise-time pulses have been measured using electro-optic sampling. For very fast transients the triggering of the protection transistor shifts from an avalanche multiplication current towards a displacement current-induced triggering, thereby lowering the trigger voltage. With our circuit simulation mode we are able to predict the outcome of human body model and charged device model testing.
In situ measurement of relative humidity in a PEM fuel cell using fibre Bragg grating sensors
 We present measurements of relative humidity using a novel FBG sensor design embedded within the active area of a single cell. The fabrication, calibration, and installation methods for the Bragg grating based sensors are presented. The sensors are located at two distinct channel and land locations on both anode and cathode, and the measurements are compared with data from capacitive sensors located at the edges of the flow field. Experiments conducted under dynamic conditions show significant differences between land and channel locations, particularly on the cathode side, and suggest that it may not be appropriate to use RH measurements in the channel to infer the membrane hydration level on the cathode side during operation. The response time of the FBG sensor also allows resolution of RH transients associated with electro-osmotic drag and back diffusion. The study shows that these FBG sensors can be integrated in a PEM fuel cell with minimal impact on performance, and allow spatially and time resolved measurements in regions inaccessible by other techniques.
Traumatic optic neuropathy
 Knowledge concerning the pathophysiologic mechanisms of traumatic optic neuropathy is limited. The optic nerve is a tract of the brain. Therefore, the cellular and biochemical pathophysiology of brain and spinal cord trauma and ischemia provide insight into mechanisms that may operate in traumatic optic neuropathy. The dosage of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/6 hours) which was successful in the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study 2 (NASCIS 2) evolved from the unique pharmacology of corticosteroids as antioxidants. The management of traumatic optic neuropathy rests on an accurate diagnosis which begins with a comprehensive clinical assessment and appropriate neuroimaging. The results of medical and surgical strategies for treating this injury have not been demonstrated to be better than those achieved without treatment. The spinal cord is a mixed grey and white matter tract of the brain in contrast to the optic nerve which is a pure white matter tract. The treatment success seen with methylprednisolone in the NASCIS 2 study may not generalize to the treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy. Conversely, if the treatment does generalize to the optic nerve, NASCIS 2 data suggests that treatment must be started within eight hours of injury, making traumatic optic neuropathy one of the true ophthalmic emergencies. Given the uncertainties in the treatment, ophthalmologists involved in the management of traumatic optic neuropathy are encouraged to participate in the collaborative study of traumatic optic neuropathy.
Development of steady/transient dual plasma irradiation device using a plasma gun
 Synergistic effects of steady state plasma irradiation and transient heat/particle loads to plasma facing materials are an important plasma surface interaction issue in future fusion devices. To investigate the effects systematically, a new plasma gun device was developed and was combined to the linear plasma device NAGDIS-I. Fundamental characteristics of the plasma gun device are revealed in this paper. The amount of tungsten released from the electrode was measured with a material probe method. Also, the emissions from the impurities were investigated spectroscopically. To measure the plasma density, an interferometer measurement was developed; the ion temperature was measured spectroscopically. Moreover, a preliminary irradiation test of the plasma pulse to a tungsten sample was done, and the surface morphology change was shown with the analysis by a scanning electron microscope.
Calibration of electrodiffusion probes for turbulent flow measurements
 Calibration of electrodiffusion (ED) probes with respect to the wall velocity gradient measurements has been experimentally studied in a fully developed turbulent channel flow over the Reynolds number range 14000–23000. In steady state conditions, direct calibration concerning the mean wall velocity gradient can be provided using simultaneous transient and steady state diffusion limiting current measurements. Indirect calibration of the ED probes regarding the turbulent fluctuation has been undertaken using a spectral analysis performed with probes of different size and geometry. This indirect calibration method has been supported using the measurements of thermo-dependence of molecular diffusivity. In this case, only one ED probe can be used for calibration. Dynamic calibration provides necessary information about critical longitudinal dimension of ED probes. When the longitudinal dimension of the probes exceeds the critical length, the probes becomes sensitive to the normal fluctuation as well. This fact has been confirmed using different orientation of the rectangular ED probe with respect to the flow direction.
Experimental characterization methods for thermal contact resistance: A review
 Thermal contact resistance (TCR) plays an importance role in thermal management, which can strongly affect heat dissipation across interfaces, especially as devices are becoming smaller and smaller in size. This paper presents a review of commonly used experimental characterization methods for TCR including the steady-state method, the T-type method, micro-thermometry, Raman-based techniques, infrared thermography measurements, laser-flash measurements, photoacoustic techniques, the 3ω method and transient thermoreflectance techniques. Conventional steady-state measurements are still an acknowledged technique for measuring TCR for bulk materials, and recent modifications and improvements are increasing their measurement accuracy and reliability. Transient methods are diverse and widely applied to both bulk and low dimension materials. We describe in detail the principles and developments of both the steady-state and transient methods and summarize new applications for different material level and the features of each test methodology for TCR. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing TCR characterization and identify possible future research directions.
Fiber optic sensor technology: an overview
 This work presents an overview of progress and developments in the field of fiber optic sensor technology, highlighting the major issues underpinning recent research and illustrating a number of important applications and key areas of effective fiber optic sensor development.
Multi-axis dynamic displacement measurement based on a strain shunt structure
 Transient gap or crack width monitoring is essential for structural health monitoring and failure analysis of large civil structures. In this paper, an innovative multi-axis displacement sensor, which utilises metal foil strain gauges on a strain shunt structure, has been proposed. This displacement sensor has the advantages inherited from metal foil strain sensing, such as low cost, high precision, fast dynamic response and low power consumption, and can also measure displacement in two axes independently. The working principles and sensitivity are derived theoretically from key geometrical parameters of the shunt structure, and the linear response of strain values to the given displacement of two translational axes has been demonstrated experimentally. Furthermore, modal response, stress concentration, optimal gauges installation positions and bending deformation due to moment of the third axis are studied numerically.
The fiber-optic gyroscope, a century after Sagnac's experiment: The ultimate rotation-sensing technology?
 Taking advantage of the development of optical-fiber communication technologies, the fiber-optic gyroscope (often abbreviated FOG) started to be investigated in the mid-1970s, opening the way for a fully solid-state rotation sensor. It was firstly seen as dedicated to medium-grade applications (1°/h range), but today, it reaches strategic-grade performance (10−4°/h range) and surpasses its well-established competitor, the ring-laser gyroscope, in terms of bias noise and long-term stability. Further progresses remain possible, the challenge being the ultimate inertial navigation performance of one nautical mile per month corresponding to a long-term bias stability of 10−5°/h. This paper is also the opportunity to recall the historical context of Sagnac's experiment, the origin of all optical gyros.
Investigating direct detection of axon firing in the adult human optic nerve using MRI
 The aim of this study was to directly detect spectral components of the magnetic fields of ionic currents caused by firing of the axons in the optic nerve in response to visual strobe stimulation. The magnetic field parallel to the main B0 field can potentially alter the local phase and magnitude of the MR signal which can cause signal loss due to intravoxel dephasing. Measured frequency spectra showed evidence of the strobe stimulus localized to regions containing the optic nerve, not thought to be due to motion artifacts, in 30 out of 52 experiments in 5 adult human subjects. The effect was (0.15 ± 0.05)% of the mean magnitude equilibrium signal from the voxel in the frequency range 0.7–3.3 Hz, corresponding to an estimated field of (1.2 ± 0.4) nT, at an echo time of TE = 32.4 ms using a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Only 1 of 12 phase image experiments showed effects. These findings provide preliminary evidence for direct detection of axonal firing in the optic nerve.
Transient optical diffraction of GaN/aqueous interfaces: Interfacial carrier mobility dependence on surface reactivity
 While charge transport and surface reactivity have thus far been treated as independent phenomena, the interfacial carrier mobility could be highly dependent on reaction intermediates that carry localized charge and can hop from site to site along the surface. Here, we demonstrate the use of surface sensitive transient optical grating spectroscopy to measure this lateral, interfacial carrier diffusivity at surfaces with different reactivity. We find that for n-GaN, for which substantial charge transfer occurs during equilibration with the water oxidation reaction, the interfacial hole diffusivity increases from air by a factor greater than two under 0.1 M HBr and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolytes.
Converter monitoring in a wind turbine application
 Two Converter Monitoring Units (CMU) which were retrofitted in a multi Mega Watt wind turbine converter are presented. Synchronized sampling of semiconductor voltage (vceon) and semiconductor current (ic) enables the condition monitoring of the power modules. A vceon measurement circuitry for field operation is presented. A novel method of numerical integration of Rogowski coil voltage enables current sensing. Data from a whole year of operation show that the presented methods are consistent throughout long term operation, and that both the measurement principles and reference functions (model) are consistent during long time operation. It is thus expected that degradation of power modules and gate drives can be monitored.
Comparison of pupil responses to luminance and colour in severe optic neuritis
 Objective: The pupil response to light flux increments is abnormal in severe optic neuritis, but little is known about the effects of this condition on the pupil colour response. The aim of this study was to examine how optic neuritis affects pupil responses to light flux and colour modulation and the extent to which such pupil responses mirror the loss and recovery of vision. Methods: A new pupil examination technique that makes use of sinusoidal modulation of either luminance contrast or chromatic saturation was employed. This technique enables the automatic extraction of both pupil response amplitude and latency and achieves a high signal to noise ratio with fewer averages. Results: The study reveals a greater loss of pupil response amplitude and significantly longer latencies to chromatic modulation (i.e. ∼80 ms). Stimulation of the unaffected eye in the optic neuritis group results in smaller response amplitudes when compared to the normal group for both light flux and colour modulation. Conclusions: Pupil response components can be affected differently in optic neuritis. These findings suggest that the pupil colour response, in particular, may provide a useful, objective estimator to judge the extent of damage and recovery in diseases of the optic nerve.
Coherent optical fiber interferometric sensor for incipient cavitation index detection
 Optical fiber sensors (OFSs) are nowadays widely adopted in many different fields and applications. Cavitation in pipeline systems is one of the main concerns of engineers because of its serious consequences for the lifetime of pipelines and on the performance of hydraulic devices. Among other useful parameters the incipient cavitation index is one of the most important because it represents the very beginning of the phenomenon. The present paper discusses the possibility of using optical fiber technology to detect cavitation in a pipeline. The experimental system exploits an interferometric fiber optical sensor based on a coherent demodulation scheme, avoiding the need for working point stabilization systems and coping with the polarization fading. Several dispositions and geometries for the sensors have been tested to select the most efficient solution. The results are then compared with cavitation indexes calculated following the standard procedure, using accelerometer measurements, to prove the optical fiber sensors’ effectiveness.
New photodiodes based graphene-organic semiconductor hybrid materials
 New photodiodes based graphene-organic semiconductor hybrid materials were fabricated for the first time using sol–gel spin coating technique. The current–voltage characteristics of the Au/GO:coumarin/p-Si/Al diodes were investigated under dark and various illumination intensities. The various junction parameters of the diodes were determined using I–V, C–V and transient characteristics. The transient photocurrent measurements indicate that Au/GO:coumarin/p-Si/Al diodes are very sensitive to illumination and the precise responsivity of the diodes is tunable by adjusting GO:coumarin fraction. The capacitance–voltage–frequency (C–V–f) measurements indicate that the capacitance of the diodes depends on voltage and frequency. The capacitance decreases with increasing frequency due to a continuous distribution of the interface states. The ability to tune the photosensitivity in the photoconductive mode through graphene oxide:coumarin weight ratio has been shown to lead to a near-constant sensitivity to illumination for a weight ratio of 0.03GO. The obtained results suggest that Au/GO:coumarin/p-Si/Al diodes can be used as a photosensor in optic communications.
Shock measurement with non-contacting fiber optic levers
 The displacement, velocity, and acceleration performance limits of a non-contacting fiber optic lever vibration transducer are quantified. Performance characteristics are experimentally verified and measurements of displacement, velocity, and acceleration obtained from impacted plates are compared with those obtained by using conventional accelerometers. It is shown that all relevant transducer quantities, i.e., absolute maximum and minimum levels, dynamic range, and frequency response, lend themselves to quantification (or optimization) on a single graphic representation. The transducer is particularly useful for measuring high frequency shock parameters.
The transient behaviour of an input protection
 The high frequency behaviour of input protections has been measured with electro-optic sampling. These measurements allow the determination of the time dependence of the voltages at internal nodes as well as the time dependence of the current through the input protection. Simulations are performed using a detailed model of the input protection and a simplified model of the integrated circuit, including connections. The measurements are vital to the development of the model, which ultimately aims at explaining the differences found in Human Body Model testing and Charged Device Model testing.
Streaming potential measurements for downhole monitoring of reservoir fluid flows: A laboratory study
 In this paper, we conduct an experimental study to investigate the use of streaming potential measurements for downhole monitoring of fluid flows in porous media for production and stimulation operations. The streaming potential arises from the movement of conductive fluid through a porous medium under an applied pressure gradient. It is generated through a passive electrokinetic process that does not require any electrical power source. Existing coreflooding apparatus is enhanced with capability of streaming potential measurements as oils or brines of different composition and salinity are injected at varying flow rates into carbonate core samples at elevated pressure. The main objective is to establish a correlation between the trend in the variations of the streaming potential and fluid flow in the core and develop the experimental fundamentals within the coreflood equipment. First experimental results are found consistent with previously published data which verifies the new experimental setup. This is followed by performing and analysis of additional experimental cases showing the sensitivity of streaming potential response on the composition of the saturating fluid and the rock permeability. The magnitude of the streaming potential is observed to decrease as the salinity of the brine injected into the core sample is increased and/or rock permeability is higher when maintaining the same fluid injection rate. The streaming potential is also measured for oil-saturated cores while injecting brine. The obtained trend in the streaming potential demonstrates the potential use of such measurements to track the water front during production operations. The goal is to establish experimental fundamentals within the coreflood equipment and this will be used for a further large scale experiment. This is expected to enable a better understanding of the electrokinetic process and alleviate the inherent uncertainties associated with the application of the streaming potential in the field.
Design status and procurement activities of the High Voltage Deck 1 and Bushing for the ITER Neutral Beam Injector
 The ITER Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) power supply system includes several non-standard components, whose ratings go beyond the present industrial practice. Two of these items, to be procured by Fusion for Energy, are:1.A −1 MVdc air-insulated Faraday cage, called High Voltage Deck 1 (HVD1), hosting the Ion Source and Extractor Power Supplies (ISEPS) and the associated diagnostics.2.A −1 MVdc feedthrough, called HVD1-TL Bushing, aimed at connecting the HVD1 to the gas (SF6) insulated Transmission Line (TL), containing inside its High Voltage (HV) conductor all ISEPS power and control cables coming from the HVD1 to be connected to the NBI Ion Source services. A −1 MVdc air-insulated Faraday cage, called High Voltage Deck 1 (HVD1), hosting the Ion Source and Extractor Power Supplies (ISEPS) and the associated diagnostics. A −1 MVdc feedthrough, called HVD1-TL Bushing, aimed at connecting the HVD1 to the gas (SF6) insulated Transmission Line (TL), containing inside its High Voltage (HV) conductor all ISEPS power and control cables coming from the HVD1 to be connected to the NBI Ion Source services. The paper deals with the status of the design of the HVD1 and HVD1-TL Bushing, focusing on insulation, mechanical and thermal issues as well as on their integration with the other components of the power supply system. In particular, the insulation issue of the integrated system has been addressed by means of an electrostatic Finite Element (FE) analysis whilst a FE thermal simulation has been carried out to assess the impact of the dissipation of the proposed design of the inner conductors (ISEPS conductors) not actively cooled. Finally, the paper describes the status of procurement strategy and execution.
Current sources for fiber optic lasers
 A large group of fiber optic lasers are powered by DC current. Laser drive is supplied by a current source with modulation added further along the signal path. The current source, although conceptually simple, constitutes an extraordinarily tricky design problem. The key to a successful design is a thorough understanding of individual system requirements. Various approaches suit different sets of freedoms and constraints, although all must address some basic concerns. There are two basic sets of concerns for laser current sources: performance and protection. Performance issues include the current source's magnitude and stability under all conditions, output connection restrictions, voltage compliance, efficiency, programming interface, and power requirements. Protection features must be included to prevent laser and optical component damage. The laser, an expensive and delicate device, must be protected under all conditions, including supply ramp up and down, improper control input commands, open or intermittent load connections and “hot plugging.”
Chapter 4 Electro-Optic Measurement Techniques for Picosecond Materials, Devices, and Integrated Circuits
 This chapter discusses the electro-optic measurement techniques for picosecond materials, devices, and integrated circuits. It describes the fastest of the current optical techniques available, electro-optic sampling. Electro-optic sampling uses electro-optic crystals as the electrical signal sensor. In this system, optical pulses interact directly with the electrical signal via the electro-optic effect. As such, it is an all-optical technique and is one of the simplest ways to exploit the availability of picosecond optical pulses directly as sampling gates. The most significant advantages of the electro-optic measuring techniques are high temporal resolution and flexibility. The applications of electro-optic measuring include the measurement of single devices, such as the 5.4-ps permeable base transistor (PBT); the characterization of transmission lines, the internal probing of GaAs integrated circuits, and InP circuits; the cryogenic measurement of superconducting devices and materials; the external probing of devices and integrated circuits; and even the detection of freely propagating terahertz radiation pulses. The flexibility is attributed to the simple mechanism on which the technique is based that is the electro-optic or Pockels effect, where the optical properties (birefringence) of a crystal change when an electric field is applied across it.
10 Gb/s broadband silicon electro-optic absorption modulator
 Here we propose a design for a novel broadband silicon electro-optic absorption modulator. The device is simply a 100 µm long silicon waveguide with a Schottky diode integrated in it. Modulation is achieved through free-carrier absorption, not interference effects, enabling operation over the entire bandwidth of the waveguide. The high overlap between the modulated carrier density and the optical mode enables high speed (> 10 Gb/s), small footprint and modulation depths of ∼ 4.6 dB.
Coumarin:GO doped Bi2O3 composites/p-type silicon hybrid photodiodes
 Au/Coumarin:GO doped Bi2O3/p-Si diodes were prepared by drop casting technique. The current-voltage characteristics of the diodes were analzyed under solar light illumination to determine photodiode behavior. The diodes exhibited a photodiode behavior as the photocurrent is higher than the dark current. The photoconducting mechanism of the diodes is a linear photoconducting behavior. The photoconducting behavior of the diodes was improved with Coumarin: GO doping. The transient photocurrent, photocapacitance and photoconductance behaviours of the diodes were analyzed. The diodes exhibited a photocapacitance and photoconductance behavior under solar light illumination. It was found that the hybrid diodes could be used as a photocapacitor or photodiode in electro-optic applications.
Sources of error in Debye–Waller-effect measurements relevant to studies of photoinduced structural dynamics
 We identify and quantify several practical effects likely to be present in both static and ultrafast electron-scattering experiments that may interfere with the Debye–Waller (DW) effect. Using 120-nm thick, small-grained, polycrystalline aluminum foils as a test system, we illustrate the impact of specimen tilting, in-plane translation, and changes in z height on Debye–Scherrer-ring intensities. We find that tilting by less than one degree can result in statistically-significant changes in diffracted-beam intensities for large specimen regions containing > 105 nanocrystalline grains. We demonstrate that, in addition to effective changes in the field of view with tilting, slight texturing of the film can result in deviations from expected DW-effect behavior. Further, we find that in-plane translations of as little as 20 nm also produce statistically-significant intensity changes, while normalization to total image counts eliminates such effects arising from changes in z height. The results indicate that the use of polycrystalline films in ultrafast electron-scattering experiments can greatly reduce the negative impacts of these effects as compared to single-crystal specimens, though it does not entirely eliminate them. Thus, it is important to account for such effects when studying thin-foil specimens having relatively short reciprocal-lattice rods.
External electro-optic integrated circuit probing
 An external electro-optic measurement system with subpicosecond resolution has been developed. This electro-optic sampling system is designed to operate as a non-contact probe of voltages in electrical devices and circuits with modified wafer-level test equipment and no special circuit preparation. Measurements demonstrate the system's ability to probe continuous and pulsed signals on microwave integrated circuits on arbitrary substrates with single-micron spatial resolution. We also discuss the application of external electro-optic sampling to various aspects of time-domain circuit studies, including the generation of short electrical test pulses using novel photoconductive techniques and the propagation of pulses on interconnects.
The fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, URB597, promotes retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection in a rat model of optic nerve axotomy
 The endocannabinoid, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), is degraded by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). This study examined whether the FAAH inhibitor, URB597, increases retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival following optic nerve axotomy in young and aged animals. URB597 alone, or together with either a CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonist, was administered daily for 1 or 2 weeks post-axotomy. Histological assessment of retinas indicated that URB597 increased RGC survival in young retina at 1 and 2 weeks post-axotomy. The increase in RGC survival at 2 weeks was accompanied by a reduction in phagocytic microglia. The CB1 antagonist, AM281, but not the CB2 antagonist, AM630, ablated URB597-mediated RGC neuroprotection. CB1 or CB2 antagonism increased phagocytic microglia in URB597 and vehicle-treated animals. In aged animals, URB597 increased RGC survival at 1 week, but not at 2 weeks post-axotomy and had no effect on microglia. Retinal Iba-1 positive microglia were also decreased in URB597-treated axotomized young animals and this decrease was mitigated by CB1 but not CB2 antagonism. As seen with phagocytotic microglia, the CB2 antagonist, AM630, increased Iba-1 positive microglia in the absence of URB597 treatment. Measurement of retinal endocannabinoid levels in URB597-treated animals at 2 weeks post-axotomy revealed a significant increase in AEA levels, accompanied by a decrease in the AEA metabolite, N-arachidonoyl glycine, in young animals but not aged animals. 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels were similar across all experimental groups. These data demonstrate that URB597-mediated retinal neuroprotective effects are mediated primarily through CB1 receptors and that URB597 neuroprotective efficacy declines with age.
Experimental study of electroluminescence and temperature distribution in high-power AlGaInN LEDs & LED arrays
 Comprehensive analysis of current spreading, temperature distribution, and near-field electroluminescence of high-power “face-up” AlInGaN LEDs and LED Arrays was performed by combination of different experimental methods. Measurement results of thermal impedance and temperature distribution (mapping) of powerful light-emitting diode assemblies are described. A thermal resistance characterization consists in investigations of transient processes of temperature-sensitive parameter under heating by step-form or harmonically pulse-width modulated direct current and analysis using a thermal equivalent circuit (the Cauer and Foster models). By the involved method, thermal resistances of internal elements of the LEDs are determined. At the same time high resolution mapping of EL and thermal radiation was obtained by optical microscope and infrared images technique. It has been established correlation of the thermal resistance with a change in the current distribution (current crowding) at high excitation levels.
The pattern electroretinogram: N95 amplitudes in normal subjects and optic neuritis patients
 Recent work has suggested that the N95 peak of the transient pattern electroretinogram (PERG) may be a more sensitve indicator of the late stages of retinal function prior to optic nerve activation than the P50 peak. In the report, we show that a new measure of N95 amplitude, based on digital filtering methods to identify a non-linear baseline measurement, greatly reduced the amplitude variation in a population of 50 normal subjects when compared with two other plausible measures. We then used that new measure to follow the time course of N95 amplitudes in 12 optic neuritis patients. It was found that mintenance of a normal N95 amplitude at 6 months after onset of optic neuritis was always associated with excellent clinical recovery as measured by visual fields, acuity, presence or absence of an afferent pupil and optic atrophy, and contrast sensitivity (CS). Loss of N95 amplitude to below laboratory limits of normal was associated with abnormalities in these indicators of visual function. This study supports the idea that the N95 peak represents retinal ganglion cell function.
Fiber Optic Transceivers
 Over the years, discrete solutions in most of the datacom applications are replaced by fiber optic transceivers (TRX). Each TRX is a combination of a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) in a single common housing. The transmitter unit, with either a light-emitting diode (LED) or an edge or vertical-emitting laser diode (LD) as its radiation source, and the receiver unit, which in most cases is a positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) photodiode, are connected together to the transmission medium, either multimode or single-mode fiber. Thus, transceivers characteristically have duplex optical receptacles at one side of the housing, which fit to the corresponding duplex connectors contrary to typical telecom applications with single-fiber optic connectors. The implementation of more or less electronics with integrated circuits and passive components into the Tx and Rx units depends on the application. This chapter discusses the aspects of operation and the application of fiber optic transceivers in the physical layer (PHY), along with some innovative tendencies for the integration of more data transport functions into these components or for a significant reduction of size and power consumption.
Failure to form a stable topographic map during optic nerve regeneration: abnormal activity-dependent mechanisms
 Visually evoked responses in the optic tectum are mediated by glutamate receptors. During development, there is a switch from N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)- to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-mediated activity as the retinotectal map refines and visual function ensues. A similar pattern is seen in goldfish as the map refines during optic nerve regeneration. Here we examined glutamate receptors during optic nerve regeneration in the lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, in which an imprecise retinotopic map forms transiently but degrades, leaving animals blind via the experimental eye. Receptor function was examined using NMDA and AMPA/kainate antagonists during in vitro tectal recording of visually evoked post-synaptic extracellular responses. Expression of NR1 (NMDA) and GluR2 (AMPA) receptor subtypes was examined immunohistochemically. In unoperated control animals, responses were robust and AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated. When the imprecise map was present, responses were difficult to evoke and insecure; periods of spontaneous activity as well as inactivity were also noted. Although AMPA/kainate-mediated activity persisted and GluR2 immunoreactivity increased transiently, NMDA receptor-mediated activity was also consistently detected and NR1 expression increased. In the long term, when the map had degraded, responses were readily evoked and predominantly AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated although some NMDA-mediated activity and NR1 expression remained. We suggest that the asynchronous activity reaching the optic tectum results in an inability to recapitulate the appropriate functional sequences of expression of NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors necessary to refine the retinotectal map.
Fiber optic in vivo imaging in the mammalian nervous system
 The compact size, mechanical flexibility, and growing functionality of optical fiber and fiber optic devices are enabling several new modalities for imaging the mammalian nervous system in vivo. Fluorescence microendoscopy is a minimally invasive fiber modality that provides cellular resolution in deep brain areas. Diffuse optical tomography is a non-invasive modality that uses assemblies of fiber optic emitters and detectors on the cranium for volumetric imaging of brain activation. Optical coherence tomography is a sensitive interferometric imaging technique that can be implemented in a variety of fiber based formats and that might allow intrinsic optical detection of brain activity at a high resolution. Miniaturized fiber optic microscopy permits cellular level imaging in the brains of behaving animals. Together, these modalities will enable new uses of imaging in the intact nervous system for both research and clinical applications.
Layer-Specific Targeting of Direction-Selective Neurons in the Zebrafish Optic Tectum
 Direction selectivity (DS) is an important neuronal property in the visual system, but how DS is generated beyond the retina remains controversial. Here, we report a close correspondence between the preferred direction (PD) and the morphology of DS cells in the optic tectum. Ca2+ imaging in cells expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 and multiphoton-targeted patch-clamp recordings allowed us to compare structure and function in single neurons. The arbors of differently tuned cell types showed stereotypic differences in shape and laminar profile within the tectal neuropil. Excitatory synaptic inputs were directionally tuned and matched the PD of spike output in these cells, while inhibitory inputs were selective for nonpreferred directions. Functional Ca2+ imaging in afferent axons showed a matching laminar distribution of DS presynaptic activity. Hence, different directions are represented in different layers, which suggests a simple mechanism for how tectal neurons acquire directional tuning in a nascent circuit.
Design of a thermoelectric generator with fast transient response
 Thermoelectric modules are currently used both in Peltier cooling and in Seebeck mode for electricity generation. The developments experienced in both cases depend essentially on two factors: the thermoelectric properties of the materials that form these elements (mainly semiconductors), and the external structure of the semiconductors. Figure of Merit Z is currently the best way of measuring the efficiency of semiconductors, as it relates to the intrinsic parameters of the semiconductor: Seebeck coefficient, thermal resistance, and thermal conductivity. When it comes to evaluating the complete structure, the Coefficient of Performance (COP) is used, relating the electrical power to the thermal power of the module. This paper develops a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) structure which allows minimising the response time of the thermoelectric device, obtaining short working cycles and, therefore, a higher working frequency.
The molecular and supramolecular engineering of polymeric electro-optic materials
 A new class of electro-optic chromophores, of which 2-dicyanomethylen-3-cyano-4-{2-[E-(4-N,N-di(2-acetoxyethyl)-amino)-phenylene-(3,4-dibutyl)thien-5]-E-vinyl}-5,5-dimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran (denoted FTC) is the prototype, has been prepared, characterized, and used to fabricate electro-optic devices. The molecular hyperpolarizability and thermal stability of these chromophore molecules are exceptional. Strong intermolecular electrostatic interactions inhibit the efficient poling of these molecules. A statistical mechanical theoretical treatment is used to quantitatively predict the competition of poling, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, and thermal effects in defining achievable acentric order and hence macroscopic optical nonlinearity. Theory is used to predict the optimum chromophore structure and material composition (chromophore loading in a polymer matrix) for maximum electro-optic activity and minimum optical loss. Problems associated with lattice hardening to lock-in poling-induced order are discussed briefly.
Frequency multiplier using cascade integrated-optic phase modulators based on Sagnac interferometer
 This work presents a frequency multiplier generated by a fiber optic Sagnac interferometer based on cascade integrated-optic phase modulators. The effective Vπ of this interferometer can be reduced to Vπ/2N, where N is the number of phase modulators. The generated frequencies depend on the applied modulation amplitude and the number of integrated-optic phase modulators. The output frequency can be multiplied by simultaneously using two integrated-optic phase modulators employed with π rad out of phase of each other. Experimental results indicate that a stable frequency of 1.008 GHz, i.e., 24 times higher than the modulation frequency, can be easily achieved by applying a low modulation frequency to the optical interferometric system.
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon multi-SOI waveguide modulator with low voltage–length product
 Electrically induced phase modulation is characterized for the first time in a waveguide-integrated Fabry–Perot resonating cavity based both on an index- and conductivity- high-contrast amorphous silicon/amorphous silicon carbide (a-Si:H/a-SiC:H) multistack. The device consists of a single mode a-Si:H rib waveguide containing three insulating thin layers of a-SiC:H embedded within the core thickness. The effective refractive index change, Δneff, at the wavelength of λ=1.55 μm is achieved through the application of an electric field across the stack which induces carrier accumulation at all the a-Si:H/a-SiC:H interfaces, resulting in turn in a high interaction between the optical beam and the accumulation layers. This configuration allows to obtain a Vπ×Lπ product of about 5.9 V cm, not far from what observed in high performing electro-optical modulators in crystalline silicon.
Distributed Temperature Sensing for Soil Physical Measurements and Its Similarity to Heat Pulse Method
 Application of the distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system in environmental and earth sciences is a rapidly evolving field. The aim of this review is to provide information to the novice and expert alike for the use of a DTS system for soil physical measurements. DTS is capable of measuring soil temperature at scales of meters to kilometers, and soil thermal properties and water contents can be derived based on DTS-measured temperatures. This literature review summarizes the interdisciplinary results obtained by theoretical, experimental, and numerical methods in laboratory and field investigations. This review is organized as follows: (1) review of theories and principles for Raman-DTS, the components of a DTS system, methods for measurements, calibration, data interpretation, and accuracy and precision assessment of the DTS method for soil science and hydrological application; (2) discussion of the applications of the DTS method for soil temperature, thermal properties, and water/moisture measurement; and (3) discussion of the limitations and perspectives for the application of DTS and its similarity to the heat pulse method. The chapter closes with a brief overview of future needs and opportunities for further development and application of the DTS method.
An improved distributed sensing method for monitoring soil moisture profile using heated carbon fibers
 Soil moisture variation with respect to depth directly affects the engineering properties of soil and the health state of plants. At the present, there are few techniques that can satisfactorily quantify the vertical moisture profile within the soil medium. In this paper, a fiber optic sensor-based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technique is introduced for soil moisture profile mapping. In this technique, a carbon fiber heated sensing-tube (CFHST) is integrated into conventional fiber optic sensing cable to improve the sensitivity, accuracy and spatial resolution of the measurement of soil moisture profile. The CFHST consists of three parts: the inner tubing, the carbon fiber heated cable (CFHC) tightly wrapped on inner tubing, and the interface screws installed on both ends of the inner tubing. The length of a unit CFHST is adjustable according to the actual demand of a specified application. The power supply model and installation method in field are introduced. Laboratory tests were conducted to establish the relationship between soil moisture and thermal response of CFHST. A foundation pit dewatering test was also carried out to validate the field performance of this monitoring technique. The test results show that the borehole-embedded sensor monitored and recorded the continuous change of soil moisture profile accurately (RMSE = 0.046 m3/m3). This technique can effectively capture the distribution profile of soil moisture along the depth direction, which provides a new approach to investigate the physical and hydrological properties of soils.
Neutron radiation effects on Fabry–Perot fiber optic sensors
 Nuclear Power Plant operators and Generation IV plant designers are considering advanced data transmission and measurement systems to improve system economics and safety, while concurrently addressing the issue of obsolescence of instrumentation and control systems. Fiber optic sensors have advantages over traditional sensors such as immunity to electromagnetic interference or radio frequency interference, higher sensitivity and accuracy, smaller size and less weight, higher bandwidth and multiplexing capability. A Fabry–Perot fiber optic sensor utilizes a unique interferometric mechanism and data processing technique, and has potential applications in nuclear radiation environments. Three sensors with different gamma irradiation history were irradiated in a mixed neutron/gamma irradiation field, in which the total neutron fluence was 2.6×1016 neutrons/cm2 and the total gamma dose was 1.09 MGy. All of them experienced a temperature shift of about 34°F but responded linearly to temperature changes. An annealing phenomenon was observed as the environmental temperature increased, which reduced the offset by approximately 63%.
Development of an optical voltage transformer for power protection relays
 We developed a new optical voltage transformer for power protection relays in HV transmission lines. Two temperature compensation approaches, namely, the temperature controller-box method and the dual-optical-path method are discussed and adopted in the apparatus. In addition, the retard of the circuit has been analyzed by experiments. A large number of experiments proved the correctness of our design.
Thermo-compensation of electrodiffusional wall velocity gradient measurements
 Thermo-dependence of electrodiffusional measurements of wall velocity gradient has been studied in a fully developed turbulent channel flow. In isothermal conditions, the direct thermo-compensation can be provided using the measurements of thermo-dependence of molecular diffusivity and viscosity. The simultaneous transient and steady-state limiting diffusion current measurements open the possibility for in situ compensation of thermal effects in electrodiffusional flow diagnostics at non-isothermal conditions where the local temperature gradients are presented. The feasibility of the proposed method of thermo-compensation has been confirmed experimentally for the case of local heating of the solution by means of pulse hot-wire technique.
Recent advances in fibre optic sensors
 The subject area of fibre optic sensing is one in which there has been shown a very rapid expansion of interest over the last few years. Many novel techniques are appearing in the literature and some products are available to the industrial user. The background to fibre optic sensing and some recent developments will be reviewed in this paper, which includes an assessment of developments in the field in various countries of the world.
Adaptive distance protection setting in presence of mid-point STATCOM using synchronized measurement
 EHV and HV transmission lines are used widely to transfer power from power generating area to large load centers. Nowadays compensating devices which uses modern power electronic devices are mostly used to improve the power transfer capability of transmission lines. Use of FACTS devices in transmission lines affect protection system very drastically. In this paper, the issues related with distance protection of transmission lines with STATCOM connected at mid-point are addressed. To mitigate the problems associated with distance protection, a novel algorithm based on synchronized measurement for adaptive relay setting is proposed. The power system is modeled in EMTDC/PSCAD software with frequency dependent model of transmission line. The results obtained for the new adaptive setting scheme are accurate, robust and superior in comparison with those obtained from existing distance protection schemes for transmission line with STATCOM.
Activity-dependent calcium transients in central nervous system myelinated axons revealed by the calcium indicator Fura-2
 Optical measurements from rat optic nerve, loaded with the new Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, provide the first evidence for the presence of activity-dependent fast intracellular [Ca2+] transients in mammalian central nervous system (CNS) myelinated axons. The results suggest that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are present in some of the myelinated axons. Optical measurements from axons stained with anterogradely transported voltage-sensitive dye suggest the presence of Ca2+-dependent potassium conductances in these axons. This report also demonstrates that Fura-2 can readily detect changes in [Ca2+] inside cells as a result of electrical activity, and establishes its suitability for measurements of intracellular Ca2+ transients in the millisecond time domain.
Acute Bilateral Optic Disk Edema with a Macular Star Figure in a 12-Year-Old Girl
 A 12-year-old girl developed headaches and bilateral optic disk edema due to malignant hypertension. Optic disk edema in most of these cases is probably on the spectrum of ischemic optic neuropathy rather than increased intracranial pressure.
Characterization of a MMIC by direct and indirect electro-optic sampling and by network analyzer measurements
 The internal frequency characteristic of a monolithic integrated 1 – 2 GHz travelling-wave amplifier based on GaAs-substrate is measured by using the direct (internal) and indirect (external) electro-optic sampling techniques. For the first time, an experimental comparison of both techniques is made. Moreover, the results are compared with conventional network analyzer measurements and simulations.
Temperature Measurement
 This chapter examines ten different physical principles used commonly as the basis for temperature-measuring devices. It is clearly impractical to connect a voltage-measuring instrument at the open end of the thermocouple to measure its output in such close proximity to the environment whose temperature is being measured, and therefore extension leads up to several meters long are normally connected between the thermocouple and the measuring instrument. The measuring system is completed by connecting the extension leads to the voltage-measuring instrument. Unfortunately, the use of extension leads of the same basic materials as the thermocouple but manufactured to a lower specification is still prohibitively expensive in the case of noble metal thermocouples. Thermocouples are delicate devices that must be treated carefully if their specified operating characteristics are to be maintained. One major source of error is induced strain in the hot junction. Thermocouples are manufactured by connecting together two wires of different materials, where each material is produced so as to conform precisely with some defined composition specification.
A flexible platform for synchronized measurements, data aggregation and information retrieval
 Synchronized measurements enable a number of applications, which shape most of the features of the smart grid paradigm. Phasor measurements units (PMUs) have an increasing role in power system state estimation, detection of inter-area and other low frequency oscillations, parameter identification, power system control and protection. Although standardization is in place for both information retrieval and data communication, there is a need to further optimize the way measurements obtained from sources with different reporting rates are exploited, by designing a platform flexible enough to simultaneously run in real time most of these PMU-based applications. In this paper such a platform is presented. It encompasses multiple PMUs from different vendors, manages detailed information about the measurement chain and its associated uncertainties and exploits a unique communication infrastructure with OpenPDC as the underlying layer for data fusion. It is based on a powerful Java EE7 application that extends OpenPDC and represents the environment for extracting, managing and processing the information. The Java EE7 application has been developed aiming for security, scalability, portability, concurrent access and big data processing. Such goals could have not been achieved without making some of the latest enterprise technologies work together. The end result can be exploited as a highly capable and interactive processing node within the grid and it also hints at important features that can be included in the upcoming IEEE C37.247 Standard for Phasor Data Concentrators for Power Systems.
Measurement system design and implementation for grid-connected marine substation
 A marine substation for a grid-connected wave power plant has been designed and constructed at Uppsala University. The measurement system for the substation has been developed from basics, and the procedure is described in this article. Subsea electrical installations set high constraints on the control and data acquisition systems used, and traditional GSM networks and GPS time synchronization are difficult and inefficient. These circumstances exclude many well-proven methods to be utilized. A compactRIO-based system, with integrated real-time controller and Field-Programmable Gate Array chip, is chosen as most suitable for this task. The system is designed to meet the special requirements encountered in this unusual application, including large data sampling, grid connection control and protection systems. The system is communicating to shore via a subsea copper cable and single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line modems. The design was successful and full-fills all the system requirements. The aim of the article is to provide future researchers with a good design and implementation procedure for setting up large measurement systems.
Viability of using an embedded FBG sensor in a composite structure for dynamic strain measurement
 In this paper, the utilisation of an embedded fibre-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor to measure dynamic strain of a clamped-clamped glass fibre composite beam is presented. A dynamic calibration test for strain measurement of the composite beam by the embedded FBG sensor and surface mounted strain gauge, at different vibration frequencies was conducted. Experimental results shown that the relationship between the photovoltage and strain measured by the embedded FBG sensor and strain gauge, respectively exhibited a linear fashion, when the strain value exceeded 1 με. Below this strain limit, the strain gauge could not precisely respond to the true strain of the beam. However, the signal extracted from the FBG sensor could truly reflect the strain of the beam at high vibration frequency condition. The first-two natural frequencies can be sharply indicated by a captured spectrum measured from the FBG sensor. Due to the out-of-plane vibration amplitude decreases with increasing the vibration frequency, the second natural frequency could not be clearly measured by the results extracted from the strain gauge.
Transient response of an electrically addressable nonlinear bistable optical device
 A study has been made of the transient response of a Fabry-Perot cavity exhibiting bistability of the optical output with applied voltage. In this system the electro-optic and optical nonlinear effects act cooperatively to produce the switch, and the transient response was shown to have characteristics associated with both mechanisms. The switch was found to be composed of three distinct regions, a purely electro-optic part, followed by a slow change in the cavity intensity brought about by the electro-optic and nonlinear effects, with a final fast switch up to the high transmission state. The relative magnitude of the time duration of regions 1 and 2 was found to be dependent upon the applied voltage, initial dc biasing and optical input power. In particular, critical slowing down was evident in region 2 of the switch for values of applied voltage close to the critical value. In this case region 2 was the dominant part of the switching time. Overdriving the system resulted in the time duration of region 2 decreasing and region 1 becoming more dominant. Qualitative agreement was achieved between the experimental results and theoretical predictions of the transient response of a cavity undergoing a slow change in some external parameter.
Heat damage evaluation in carbon fiber-reinforced composites with a kHz A-scan rate fiber-optic pump-probe laser-ultrasound system
 Composites are increasingly replacing metals for a number of applications where their reduced weight and equivalent strength compared to metals is extremely important. As composite structures become more routine, non-destructive tools are needed to monitor their structural integrity when subjected to different damage mechanisms, such as impact and thermal insults. Here we present a non-contact laser-ultrasound (LU) method to quantify and image structural changes in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites induced by thermal insult. The method uses ultra-wideband acoustic signals generated at the surface of a composite material with a laser pulse (i.e., pump), and non-contact, point-like detection of backscattered transients (i.e., probe). A comparison of results from the LU system with X-ray images of thermally insulted samples shows that high-resolution LU images (better than 1 ply) and spectral analysis of backscattered signals can identify small structural changes in composites long before delamination.
Precise Synaptic Balance in the Zebrafish Homolog of Olfactory Cortex
 Neuronal computations critically depend on the connectivity rules that govern the convergence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signals onto individual neurons. To examine the functional synaptic organization of a distributed memory network, we performed voltage clamp recordings in telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, the homolog of olfactory cortex. In neurons of posterior Dp, odor stimulation evoked large, recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs that established a transient state of high conductance and synaptic balance. Excitation and inhibition in individual neurons were co-tuned to different odors and correlated on slow and fast timescales. This precise synaptic balance implies specific connectivity among Dp neurons, despite the absence of an obvious topography. Precise synaptic balance stabilizes activity patterns in different directions of coding space and in time while preserving high bandwidth. The coordinated connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks in Dp therefore supports fast recurrent memory operations.
Temperature Measurement
 The chapter covers the background theory of all the physical principles that are commonly exploited in temperature sensors and explains how these are used in various devices. The discussion starts with the thermoelectric effect, and its use in thermocouples and thermopiles, and also the derived devices of digital thermometers and continuous thermocouples. Resistance change devices, in the form of resistance thermometers and thermistors, are covered next. Following this, semiconductor devices in the form of diodes and transistors are discussed. Moving on, the class of device known as radiation thermometers/pyrometers is considered: these exploit the physical principle that the peak wavelength of radiated energy emission from a body varies with temperature. The remaining physical principles covered in the chapter describe lesser-used techniques that only have various niche applications. These principles include thermography (thermal imaging), thermal expansion (liquid-in-glass thermometer, bimetallic thermometer, and pressure thermometer), quartz thermometry, fiber optics, and color change (used in paints, crayons, liquid crystals, and Seger/pyrometric cones). The chapter then discusses intelligent temperature-measuring devices before a concluding section on temperature sensor calibration.
Generator response following as a primary frequency response control strategy for VSC-HVDC connected offshore wind farms
 As penetration of renewable energy sources increases, the proportion of synchronous generators with rotating masses directly coupled to the grid decreases. In the case of wind generation, the kinetic energy stored in the machine rotor is not available to perform the natural task of frequency support for the AC power system. New active control methods must therefore be developed to synthetically recouple this inertia characteristic to the grid. European offshore windpower is growing and the average distance to shore is increasing. Voltage Source Converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) is a promising method for transporting this power to the onshore AC grid over long distances. The fast power transfer capability of VSC-HVDC offers the opportunity for new control strategies to provide frequency support to the AC grid. The authors propose a method for using a VSC-HVDC transmission link to follow and amplify the traditional primary frequency response behavior of a small synchronous generator connected at the point of common coupling (PCC). In terms of frequency support, the onshore grid will then see the HVDC connected offshore windfarm (OWF) and small synchronous generator together as one large synchronous generator with rotor inertia directly coupled to the grid (i.e. synthetic inertia). The method will therefore enable the OWF to provide frequency support services equivalent to that of a traditional power plant at the same rating. Electromagnetic transient simulation is used to investigate the proposed active control strategy. Fiber-optic technology is considered as a method of remote communication between the OWF and the small synchronous generator (SSG). A second communication-less method is also considered which utilizes a cascaded droop frequency to DC voltage control at the Grid Side VSC (GS-VSC) and then DC voltage to frequency at the Windfarm Side VSC (WF-VSC). Simulation results are used to justify the proposed method.
Chapter 2 Measuring high voltages and currents
 This chapter focuses on measuring high voltages (HV) and currents. Higher voltages are used in electrostatic generators, in pulsed power machines and in EMP simulators. There are two approaches to HV measurements: scale down the voltage and use LV measuring methods or use dedicated HV measuring methods. The down scaling is done with voltage transformers or with voltage dividers—resistive, reactive or combined reactive and resistive. A new alternate current (ac) high voltage sensor uses a piezoelectric transducer and a strain gauge. This sensor detects the mechanical strain of the transducer on which a foil strain gauge is cemented. Tests ascertained that the strain was directly proportional to the voltage measured, with errors less than 2 % for voltages up to 26,000 Vpp. The parameters involved in HV impulse measurements are the level and waveform, and ambient conditions like temperature, humidity and clearances from grounded or energized structures. Problems arise with systems of large dimensions. Recently developed method for measuring high dc voltages uses an electron speed-filtering system. The classical way to measure high currents is by use of shunts, current dividers or current transformers. It is also possible to measure the magnetic field generated by the current to be measured, or to measure the force between conductors. Use also can be made of optical modulators influenced by the magnetic field created by the current.
Sound field measurement in a double layer cavitation cluster by rugged miniature needle hydrophones
 During multi-bubble cavitation the bubbles tend to organize themselves into clusters and thus the understanding of properties and dynamics of clustering is essential for controlling technical applications of cavitation. Sound field measurements are a potential technique to provide valuable experimental information about the status of cavitation clouds. Using purpose-made, rugged, wide band, and small-sized needle hydrophones, sound field measurements in bubble clusters were performed and time-dependent sound pressure waveforms were acquired and analyzed in the frequency domain up to 20 MHz. The cavitation clusters were synchronously observed by an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera and the relation between the sound field measurements and cluster behaviour was investigated. Depending on the driving power, three ranges could be identified and characteristic properties were assigned. At low power settings no transient and no or very low stable cavitation activity can be observed. The medium range is characterized by strong pressure peaks and various bubble cluster forms. At high power a stable double layer was observed which grew with further increasing power and became quite dynamic. The sound field was irregular and the fundamental at driving frequency decreased. Between the bubble clouds completely different sound field properties were found in comparison to those in the cloud where the cavitation activity is high. In between the sound field pressure amplitude was quite small and no collapses were detected.
In vivo detection of ultrasonically induced cavitation by a fibre-optic technique
 The measurement of cavitation events in tissue in vivo would greatly assist us to better understand how pulsed high energy ultrasound (PHEUS) interacts with living tissues, especially with regard to cancer therapy. To accomplish this, we designed and built a fibre-optic hydrophone. The principle was to couple the light of a laser diode into a lightfibre and to register the ultrasound induced modification of the refractive index in tissue. In this manner, the cavitation event could be quantitatively investigated both in water and in vivo. The structure of the bubble dynamic is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions, and in vitro measurements. With the fibre-optic set-up, the pressure signal can also be detected. PHEUS was generated by an electromagnetic source adapted from a commercial lithotripter (LithostarTM Siemens). As biological tissue we used the experimental R3327-AT1 Dunning prostate tumor growing subcutaneously in the thigh of male Copenhagen rats. The lifetime of the cavitation bubble in water increased with the energy level of the ultrasonic pulse from 250 μs at 13 kV capacitor voltage to 750μs at 21 kV, while the lifetime inside the tumor tissue in vivo increased only from 100μs at 13 kV to 220μs at 21 kV capacitor voltage.
Visually evoked hemodynamical response and assessment of neurovascular coupling in the optic nerve and retina
 The retina and optic nerve are both optically accessible parts of the central nervous system. They represent, therefore, highly valuable tissues for studies of the intrinsic physiological mechanism postulated more than 100 years ago by Roy and Sherrington, by which neural activity is coupled to blood flow and metabolism. This article describes a series of animal and human studies that explored the changes in hemodynamics and oxygenation in the retina and optic nerve in response to increased neural activity, as well as the mechanisms underlying these changes. It starts with a brief review of techniques used to assess changes in neural activity, hemodynamics, metabolism and tissue concentration of various potential mediators and modulators of the coupling. We then review: (a) the characteristics of the flicker-induced hemodynamical response in different regions of the eye, starting with the optic nerve, the region predominantly studied; (b) the effect of varying the stimulus parameters, such as modulation depth, frequency, luminance, color ratio, area of stimulation, site of measurement and others, on this response; (c) data on activity-induced intrinsic reflectance and functional magnetic resonance imaging signals from the optic nerve and retina. The data undeniably demonstrate that visual stimulation is a powerful modulator of retinal and optic nerve blood flow. Exploring the relationship between vasoactivity and metabolic changes on one side and corresponding neural activity changes on the other confirms the existence of a neurovascular/neurometabolic coupling in the neural tissue of the eye fundus and reveals that the mechanism underlying this coupling is complex and multi-factorial. The importance of fully exploiting the potential of the activity-induced vascular changes in the assessment of the pathophysiology of ocular diseases motivated studies aimed at identifying potential mediators and modulators of the functional hyperemia, as well as conditions susceptible to alter this physiological response. Altered hemodynamical responses to flicker were indeed observed during a number of physiological and pharmacological interventions and in a number of clinical conditions, such as essential systemic hypertension, diabetes, ocular hypertension and early open-angle glaucoma. The article concludes with a discussion of key questions that remain to be elucidated to increase our understanding of the physiology of ocular functional hyperemia and establish the importance of assessing the neurovascular coupling in the diagnosis and management of optic nerve and retinal diseases.
Proposition of an optical arrangement for interface reconstruction between stratified liquids
 We propose a non-intrusive optical method to reconstruct the boundary between the two immiscible liquids under the well separated interfacial configurations. Silicon based PIN (a diode with p-type semiconductor, a lightly doped intrinsic region and an n-type region) photodiodes are used in reverse biased photovoltaic mode and extent of attenuation in the intensity of light is employed to relate the phase fraction (h/b) with obtained current signals. Phase fraction is found to have exponential relationship with the non-dimensional optical signals and is used to reconstruct the interface profile for different phase associations. The optically acquired interface profiles are in close agreement with the visual inspections for both the inclined and curved phase boundaries. Moreover, the present system is found to capable of characterizing the transient variations of the interface. This has been examined by successful prediction of interface oscillations and transient, random wavy profiles. It has also been established that preset photodiode array could be employed for measurement of flow rates and local phase fractions under the stratified regime.
InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiode for infrared single photon detection using a time-to-voltage converter
 We demonstrated an efficient and robust technique for weak avalanche discrimination by using a time-to-voltage converter circuit for the infrared single photon detection based on InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs), which enabled a strong suppression of the afterpulse noise. At a gating frequency of 10 MHz, a detection efficiency of 20.1% was obtained with a dark count probability of 1.2×10−5 and an afterpulse probability of 1.22% without dead time, paving the way for the low-noise fast detection of infrared single photons.
A critical review of soil moisture measurement
 Soil moisture content has paramount importance in dictating engineering, agronomic, geological, ecological, biological and hydrological characteristics of the soil mass. Though earlier researchers have employed various techniques of moisture content determination of soils, both in laboratory and in situ conditions, ascertaining the applicability of these techniques to soils of entirely different characteristics and the ‘types of moisture content’, which they can measure, is still a point of debate. As such, a critical review of all the established and emerging soil moisture measurement techniques with respect to their merits and demerits becomes necessary. With this in view, efforts have been made in this paper to critically evaluate all the soil moisture measurement techniques, limitations associated with them and the influence of various soil-specific parameters (viz., mineralogy, salinity, porosity, ambient temperature, presence of the organic matter and matrix structure of the soil) on the measured soil moisture content. This paper also highlights the importance of various innovations based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and nano-sensors that are emerging in this context.
Excitotoxic insults to the optic nerve alter visual evoked potentials
 Excitotoxic oligodendroglial death is one of the mechanisms which has been proposed to underlie demyelinating diseases of the CNS. We describe here functional consequences of excitotoxic lesions to the rabbit optic nerve by studying the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) measured in the visual cortex. Nerves were slowly infused with the excitotoxin kainate a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump which delivered the toxin through a cannula onto the optic nerve. Records of VEPs were obtained before pump implantation and at 1, 3 and 7 days post-implantation, and weekly evaluated thereafter for up to 4 months. We observed that the VEPs generated by light stimuli progressively changed in both amplitude and profile after the lesion as well as in comparison to those generated in control animals infused with vehicle. Histological examination of the damage caused by the excitotoxic insult showed that large areas of the optic nerve were demyelinated and their axons distorted. These observations were confirmed and extended by immunohistochemical analyses using markers to neurofilaments, myelin basic protein and the oligodendrocyte marker APC. The results of the present paper indicate that the consequences of excitotoxicity in the optic nerve share functional and morphological alterations which are found in demyelinating disorders. In addition, this experimental paradigm may be useful to evaluate the functional recovery of demyelinated optic nerves following various repair strategies.
A new shape memory alloy film/p-Si solar light four quadrant detector for solar tracking applications
 Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are promising materials for industrial and electronic actuators applications. The Cu-Al-Mn-Ni shape memory alloy was coated as a Schottky contact on p-Si substrate to fabricate a four quadrant sensor using a vacuum coating system. A front illuminated shape memory film-p-type silicon -based four-quadrant solar light Schottky sensor was fabricated using the various metal contact masks. The electrical and photoresponse properties of Cu-Al-Mn-Ni/p-Si diode were investigated. These properties of the diode were analyzed under in a wide range of frequencies and illumination intensities. The reverse current of the diode increases with increasing illumination intensities. This result confirms that the diode exhibits both photoconducting and photovoltaic behavior. The forward bias current of the diode increases exponentially with voltage confirming rectification behavior. Electronic parameters such as ideality factor, barrier height and series resistance of the diode were determined from I-V characteristics and Cheung’s functions. The transient photocurrent, photocapacitance and photoconductance measurements indicate that the diode is very sensitive to illumination. Also, the admittance measurements of the diode exhibited a decrease in capacitance and increase in conductance with increasing frequency. The frequency dependence of capacitance and conductance is attributed to the presence of interface states. It is evaluated that Cu-Al-Mn-Ni/p-Si shape memory alloy film/p-Si based four quadrant detector can be used in solar tracking applications.
Optic fibre sensor for real-time damage detection in smart composite
 In this study an optical fibre sensor system was conceived for simultaneous detection of the strain and the acoustic emission due to damage. It consists of a fibre Bragg grating and a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. For the interrogation of the Fabry–Pérot cavity, an innovative low cost process based on the generation of two quadrature phase-shifted signals using two fibre Bragg gratings was implemented, allowing the recovery of the change in the cavity length. An automated processing system, based on Kohonen's self-organizing maps is also presented, for future classification of the acoustic emission waves detected by the optic fibre sensor.
Boron doped graphene based linear dynamic range photodiode
 The boron-doped graphene oxide film was prepared using drop casting/coating technique. The film was coated by hydrothermal method on p-Si substrate and thus Al/p-Si/B-doped GO/Au diode was fabricated. The structural properties of the film was investigated by SEM and EDS techniques. The optoelectronic behavior of the diode was analyzed under various solar light and frequencies. The diode indicates that the forward current is higher that of reverse current with a rectification ratio (RR = IF/IR) of 7.30 × 104 at dark and ±5 V. The diode electronic parameters of the diode were computed from electrical characteristics. An increase in the photocurrent of the diode with solar light intensity indicates the presence of a photoconduction mechanism. The photoconductive and photovoltaic response of the diode were analyzed using photocurrent measurements. The interface state density (Nss) of the diode was analyzed from conductance technique. The optoelectrical results of the studied device suggest that the diode can be used in optic communications.
Linear fiber-optic array for measuring the transient propagation of a premixed-charged flame
 A fiber-optic device for measuring the one-dimensional temporal motion of a freely propagating flame is described and demonstrated. The device uses a linear array of 16 optical fibers to collect and transmit light from a real image of the flame to photomultiplier tube detectors. A signal processor translates these signals into a single digital word that can be monitored by a dedicated computer at a 120 kHz rate. The most important feature of the device is the ability to record in real time the linear motion of very fast events. To demonstrate this device, simultaneous real-time measurements of flame position, two components of velocity, and pressure are made in the combustion chamber of a homogeneous-charge spark-ignition engine. Instantaneous values of flame speed are determined for the propagation of the flame along the diameter of a disk-shaped volume. Finally, the cycle-resolved measurements of gas velocity and flame speed are used to determine values for the turbulent burning velocity that are unbiased by cyclic variations in the combustion rate.
Experimental methods for flow and aerosol measurements in human airways and their replicas
 Recent developments in the prediction of local aerosol deposition in human lungs are driven by the fast development of computational simulations. Although such simulations provide results in unbeatable resolution, significant differences among distinct methods of calculation emphasize the need for highly precise experimental data in order to specify boundary conditions and for validation purposes. This paper reviews and critically evaluates available methods for the measurement of single and disperse two-phase flows for the study of respiratory airflow and deposition of inhaled particles, performed both in vivo and in replicas of airways. Limitations and possibilities associated with the experimental methods are discussed and aspects of the computational calculations that can be validated are indicated. The review classifies the methods into following categories: 1) point-wise and planar methods for velocimetry in the airways, 2) classic methods for the measurement of the regional distribution of inhaled particles, 3) standard medical imaging methods applicable to the measurement of the regional aerosol distribution and 4) emerging and nonconventional methods. All methods are described, applications in human airways studies are illustrated, and recommendations for the most useful applications of each method are given.
Using a pulsed laser beam to investigate the feasibility of sub-pixel position resolution with time-correlated transient signals in 3D pixelated CdZnTe detectors
 We evaluated the X-Y position resolution achievable in 3D pixelated detectors by processing the signal waveforms readout from neighboring pixels. In these measurements we used a focused light beam, down to 10  μm, generated by a ∼1  mW pulsed laser (650  nm) to carry out raster scans over selected 3×3 pixel areas, while recording the charge signals from the 9 pixels and the cathode using two synchronized digital oscilloscopes.
The effect of transient depletion of source gases on the properties of microcrystalline silicon solar cells
 In is paper, the transient behavior of silane molecules in the initial plasma ignition stage on the properties of microcrystalline silicon films is studied using tailored initial SiH4 density method, and the results are analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Compared with standard plasma ignition conditions, tailored initial SiH4 density conditions result higher crystallinity in the interface between substrate and bulk film. Finally, tailored and standard conditions are used in i-layer deposition processes of p-i-n and n-i-p solar cells. It is demonstrated that tailored initial SiH4 density conditions is helpful for the efficiency improvement of n-i-p solar cells and standard plasma ignition conditions for p-i-n solar cells.
Statistics based method for partial discharge identification in oil paper insulation systems
 An original partial discharge generated in oil insulation identification methodology based on simultaneously conducted measurements using electrical method, ultra high frequency method and acoustic emission method is presented in the paper. Three different partial discharge model sources as well as measuring instruments commonly applied for partial discharge detection in electrical power transformers are yielded within a laboratory research. Total of 45 scenarios, including proposed spark gap configurations, selected supply voltage levels and UHF frequencies are analyzed during measurements series. Furthermore, form among total of 93 descriptors assigned for every applied partial discharge model source configuration there are 24 proposed as potentially useful for partial discharge identification applications with their 95% confidence bounds. Attempt of discriminative descriptors selection for partial discharge source analysis in on-site transformer applications as well as a proposal of unique descriptors according to every selected spark gap configuration that could be potentially useful for partial discharge identification purposes are the main purpose of the presented paper. The proposed methodology verification on a real life transformer with particular consideration of the selected descriptors potential utility in the fields of partial discharge detection and identification in electrical power industry applications confirmed a proposed methodology usefulness.
A fiber-optic system for dual-modality photoacoustic microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy using miniature components
 Imaging of the cells and microvasculature simultaneously is beneficial to the study of tumor angiogenesis and microenvironments. We designed and built a fiber-optic based photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) dual-modality imaging system. To explore the feasibility of this all-optical device for future endoscopic applications, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner, a miniature objective lens, and a small size optical microring resonator as an acoustic detector were employed trying to meet the requirements of miniaturization. Both the lateral resolutions of PAM and CFM were quantified to be 8.8 μm. Axial resolutions of PAM and CFM were experimentally measured to be 19 μm and 53 μm, respectively. The experiments on ex vivo animal bladder tissues demonstrate the good performance of this system in imaging not only microvasculature but also cellular structure, suggesting that this novel imaging technique holds potential for improved diagnosis and guided treatment of bladder cancer.
Reverse correlation of rapid calcium signals in the zebrafish optic tectum in vivo
 Reverse correlation techniques provide a quantitative means of computing neuronal input/output relationships. Until now these methods have been limited to electrically recorded responses since unprocessed optical signals generally lack necessary temporal characteristics. We sought to overcome this barrier since combining reverse correlation with calcium imaging would afford a powerful alternative to current methods of measuring response properties of neurons non-invasively in vivo. We labeled zebrafish optic tecta with a calcium indicator and measured responses to a whole-field random flicker light stimulus. Although calcium signals exhibited slow decay kinetics, we could use computational modeling to show that the positive differential of these traces extracts high frequency information. Experimentally, we found that calcium signals processed in this way were synchronous with simultaneously measured synaptic responses and could be used with reverse correlation to determine temporal filters of neurons in the zebrafish optic tectum. These findings demonstrate that calcium responses to physiological stimulation can be processed to obtain rapid signal information and consequently to determine linear filter properties in vivo.
E-O functional waveguide using the electric-field-poled polymeric material for integrated-optic devices
 An electro-optic functional polymer film was prepared by electric-field poling procedures in this study. The I–V (current versus poling voltage) behaviors and the E-O performance of the polymer film were in situ characterized during poling. The vibrational spectroscopy and the Mach–Zehnder interferometer were employed to investigate the dipole orientation behavior and measure the Pockels coefficients of the polymer film. The optical path change, due to the refractive index variation, was found to be critical in determining the Pockels coefficients γ13 and γ33, with the Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
Functional monitoring of peripheral nerves from electrical impedance measurements
 Medical electrical stimulators adapted to peripheral nerves use multicontact cuff electrodes (MCC) to provide selective neural interfaces. However, neuroprostheses are currently limited by their inability to locate the regions of interest to focus. Intended until now either for stimulation or recording, MCC can also be used as a means of transduction to characterize the nerve by impedancemetry. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using electrical impedance (EI) measurements as an in vivo functional nerve monitoring technique. The monitoring paradigm includes the synchronized recording of both the evoked endogenous activity as compound action potentials (CAP) and the superimposed sine signal from the EI probe. Measurements were conducted on the sciatic nerve of rodents, chosen for its branchings towards the peroneal and tibial nerves, with both mono- and multi-contact per section electrodes. During stimulation phases, recordings showed CAP with consistent fiber conduction velocities. During coupled phases of both stimulation and sine perturbation, impedance variations were extracted using the mono-contact electrode type for certain frequencies, e.g. 2.941 kHz, and were temporally coherent with the previous recorded CAP. Using a MCC, localized evoked CAP were also recorded but the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was too low to distinguish the expected associated impedance variation and deduce an image of impedance spatial changes within the nerve. The conducted in vivo measurements allowed to distinguish both evoked CAP and associated impedance variations with a strong temporal correlation. This indicates the feasibility of functional EI monitoring, aiming at detecting the impedance variations in relation to neural activity. Further work is needed to improve the in vivo system, namely in terms of SNR, and to integrate new multicontact devices in order to move towards EI tomography with the detection of spatially-localized impedance variations. Eventually, regions that are interesting to be targeted by stimulation could be identified through these means.
Polymer electro-optic devices for integrated optics
 Recent advances in polymer electro-optic polymers and in fabrication techniques have made possible advances in polymer optical guided wave devices which bring them much closer to system ready. The processing of a new thermal set FTC polymer and its incorporation into a high-frequency, low-Vπ optical amplitude modulator are reviewed. The design and fabrication of 100 GHz modulators and their integration with rectangular metal waveguides using an anti-podal finline transition with a flexible Mylar substrate is discussed. High-speed polymer modulators with balanced outputs and the in situ trimming of the output coupler is described. More complex guided wave devices using polymers are demonstrated by the photonic rf phase shifter. Techniques for integrating both passive and active polymers into the same optical circuit without the need for mode matching is presented and demonstrated. To reduce the Vπ of a polymer amplitude modulator to 1 V or under, a technique of constant-bias voltage is demonstrated. Finally, a technique to directly laser write electro-optic polymer devices is reviewed.
Local fuel concentration measurement through spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy in a direct-injection hydrogen spark-ignition engine
 Quantitative measurements of local fuel concentrations were conducted in a direct-injection hydrogen spark-ignition research engine using the spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (SIBS) technique. For SIBS measurements, a new sensor was developed from a commercially available M12-type spark plug with no major modifications to the electrodes. The new plug sensor showed better durability and required less maintenance when used in a hydrogen research engine. Emission spectra from the plasma generated by the spark plug were collected through an optical fibre housed in the centre electrode of the plug and resolved spectrally for atomic emissions of Hα, O(I), and N(I). The main focus of the present work was to characterise the effects of ambient pressure at ignition timing on spectral line emissions and to improve the accuracy of SIBS measurements by taking into account the pressure dependency of atomic emissions. A significant effect of the corresponding pressure at ignition timing was observed on spark-induced breakdown spectroscopic measurements and emission line characteristics. Retarded spark timing (i.e. higher ambient pressure at the ignition site) resulted in lower spectral line intensities as well as weaker background emissions. It is well established that with relatively higher pressure and density of atoms or molecules, the cooling of expanding plasma accelerates, and the collision probability increases, leading to both a weaker broadband continuum and atomic emissions. A “calibration MAP” representing the correlation of air excess ratio (relative air/fuel ratio) with both intensity ratio and pressure at ignition timing was created and subsequently used for quantitative measurements of local fuel concentrations for both port injection and direct injection strategies to demonstrate and explore the effects of pressure dependency of atomic emission on the accuracy of the SIBS measurements. Local stratification of the fuel mixture in the vicinity of the spark gap location associated with direct injection strategies was confirmed; the coefficient of variation of the local air excess ratio was relatively small for measurements made using the calibration map. This demonstrated that the measurement accuracy of local fuel concentrations through a spark plug sensor can be improved significantly when the pressure dependency of atomic emissions is taken into account.
Measurement and simulation of Joule heating during treatment of B-16 melanoma tumors in mice with nanosecond pulsed electric fields
 Experimental evidence shows that nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) trigger apoptosis in skin tumors. We have postulated that the energy delivered by nsPEF is insufficient to impart significant heating to the treated tissue. Here we use both direct measurements and theoretical modeling of the Joule heating in order to validate this assumption. For the temperature measurement, thermo-sensitive liquid crystals (TLC) were used to determine the surface temperature while a micro-thermocouple (made from 30 μm wires) was used for measuring the temperature inside the tissue. The calculation of the temperature distribution used an asymptotic approach with the repeated calculation of the electric field, Joule heating and heat transfer, and the subsequent readjustment of the electrical tissue conductivity. This yields a temperature distribution both in space and time. It can be shown that for the measured increase in temperature an unexpectedly high electrical conductivity of the tissue would be required, which was indeed found by using voltage and current monitoring during the experiment. Using impedance measurements within tafter = 50 μs after the pulse revealed a fast decline of the high conductivity state when the electric field ceases. The experimentally measured high conductance of a skin fold (mouse) between plate electrodes was about 5 times higher than those of the maximally expected conductance due to fully electroporated membrane structures (Gmax/Gelectroporated) ≈ 5. Fully electroporated membrane structure assumes that 100% of the membranes are conductive which is estimated from an impedance measurement at 10 MHz where membranes are capacitively shorted. Since the temperature rise in B-16 mouse melanoma tumors due to equally spaced (Δt = 2 s) 300 ns-pulses with E = 40 kV/cm usually does not exceed ΔΤ = 3 K at all parts of the skin fold between the electrodes, a hyperthermic effect on the tissue can be excluded.
Optic and electro-optic investigations on SmQ, SmCA* and L phases in highly chiral compounds
 Chiral molecules give rise to a large variety of mesophases. Well-known examples are cholesteric or ferroelectric smectic phases where the chirality tends to favor a macroscopic twist. Furthermore, the molecular core length (l) plays an important rôle on the range of the mesophases and on the temperature (TNI) for the onset of orientational order. The tendency for TNI is to increase (going over 200∘C for some compounds) with increasing l. We report in this paper on a selection of compounds which have been designed in order to favor an anticlinic smectic ordering together with high chirality. As a common feature, they have a long rigid core with four benzene rings and a chiral chain (usually the same) at each end. They display a locally anisotropic liquid phase referred to as “L phase” in a large temperature range between TNI and the low temperature SmQ or SmCA* phase. Optical rotatory power (ORP), birefringence and electro-optic studies have been performed with these compounds.
Dynamic response of a fiber-optic ring resonator: Analysis with influences of light-source parameters
 In practice, dynamic behavior of fiber-optic ring resonator (FORR) appears as a detrimental factor to influence the transmission response of the FORR. This paper presents dynamic response analysis of the FORR by considering phase modulation of the FORR loop and sinewave modulation of input signal applied to the FORR from a laser diode. The analysis investigates the influences of modulation frequency and amplitude modulation index of laser diode, loop delay time of the FORR, phase angle between FM and AM response of laser diode, and laser diode line-width on dynamic response of the FORR. The analysis shows that the transient response of the FORR strongly depends on the product of modulation frequency and loop delay time, coupling and transmission coefficients of the FORR. The analyses presented here may have applications in optical systems employing an FORR with a laser diode source.
Displacement Measurement
 This chapter discusses the various sensing methods used for displacement measurement. Common terms are introduced followed by the two most common forms of displacement interferometry: homodyne and heterodyne. Double pass, differential and swept-frequency absolute distance interferometers are also covered. The various sources of errors associated with displacement interferometry are presented, including thermal, cosine, deadpath and periodic error. Other forms of displacement sensors are then discussed, along with their error sources, including strain sensors, capacitive sensors, eddy current and inductive sensors, optical encoders and optical fibre sensors. Lastly, the calibration of displacement sensors is discussed using both optical and X-ray interferometry.
Optical calibration for nanocalorimeter measurements
 We describe a method for calibration of nanocalorimeters from 573 K to 873 K, using resistive heating and optical pyrometry for temperature measurement. A platinum strip suspended on a silicon nitride membrane serves as both heater and temperature sensor. The calibration described here, relating resistance to temperature, enables subsequent temperature measurement. Measurements of the emissivity of as-deposited and annealed platinum thin films were also performed as a function of wavelength and temperature; these measurements are needed to correct the temperature recorded using the pyrometer. The calibration was validated by measurement of the melting point of a pure aluminum film; the melting point established with a Gaussian fit to the dT/dt data agreed within 0.1% (0.7 K) at 933.5 K. The melting point established from the minimum in the dT/dt plot agreed within 0.6% (5.5 K) at 933.5 K. Finite element modeling was used to characterize the temperature distribution.
Sources of electrical transients in tectal neuropil of the frog,Rana pipiens
 We have studied the outer neuropil layers in frog tectum where the ummyelinated optic nerve fibers terminate. At any point the neuropil an extracellular microelectrode records several different visually evoked electrical transients, distinct by size and shape. When classified by shape alone, each transient falls into one of 3 distinct classes. Some of these transients are binocularly driven, as originally described by Finch and Collett. The aggregate of the receptive fields of all the elements recorded at a single point defines a multiunit receptive field (MURF). Each MURF is characteristically oval, and divided into 3 sections along its long axis. Each section represents the aggregate of the receptive fields associated with one class of transient; i.e. transients belonging to only one specific class can be evoked by stimulating that part of the visual field corresponding to the appropriate section of the MURF. All of the MURFs mapped by recording in a single tectum are radially arranged in visual space about a central point, or ‘visual pole’. Several conclusions are made. First, the two larger types of transient are generated postsynaptically by electrically active dendritic elements, specifically the beaded dendritic appendages of tectal neurons. The smallest type of transient is of presynaptic origin. Second, these tectal elements have a local and global anatomical order across the tectum, which accounts for both the tripartite structure of the MURFs and their radial arrangement about a visual pole. Third, since the large transients are of postsynaptic origin, genuine recordings of single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) activity can be made only in the optic nerve or retina itself. Fourth, information is conveyed over the unmyelinated optic nerve fibers at pulse rates as high as 80/s and is transsynaptically effective at such rates. Finally, the electrically active tectal dendritic elements, with their highly organized spatial arrangement, are an important component of the frog's visual processing apparatus, instead of being merely relays or repeaters.
Corrosion measurement and evaluation techniques of steel in concrete structures
 This chapter reviews different techniques for evaluating and measuring the corrosion of steel in concrete. Since corrosion consists of electrochemical reactions at the interface between the metal (i.e., reinforcing steel) and an electrolyte solution (i.e., concrete pore solution), most of these measurement techniques are based on electrochemistry and electrochemical measurement methods. In this chapter, conventional corrosion measurement methods, which have electrochemical bases, as well as nonconventional methods such as LC resonator, are discussed.
A wavelength selective application for an optical fiber surface plasmon resonance sensor
 In this paper, a wavelength selective optical fiber surface plasmon resonance sensor, which provides a flexible detection capability, has been experimentally investigated. The light reflected from the sensor tip in response to flowing water and ethanol are monitored at several single wavelengths. The reflected light transient modulated by flowing solvent has an exponential form, which the change in magnitude and response time are dependent on the monitoring wavelength. Optimal wavelength best suited for measurement was determined by investigating the dynamic response curve. Rather than wavelength and angular interrogation methods commonly used in SPR measurement, this single wavelength monitoring scheme is a low-cost, flexible and reliable method.
Increasing the dynamic range of a transient recorder by using two analog-to-digital converters
 This article describes an algorithm for recording transient voltages with enhanced dynamic range by using two 8-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The method requires each transient to be recorded in both ADCs, with different input voltage gains. The transients then are compared and combined to produce a single signal that has less digitization noise and greater dynamic range than signals recorded by either ADC alone and with no decrease in the sampling rate of the ADCs. The selection of operating parameters is considered and guidelines are established for the performance of this type of transient recorder. The system described here was built as a data acquisition device for a time-of-flight mass spectrometer; however, the algorithm could be applied to other types of ADC-based applications to extend their dynamic range.
Multifunctional optical MEMS sensor platform with heterogeneous fiber optic Fabry–Pérot sensors for wireless sensor networks
 A multifunctional optical sensor platform based on the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology is developed with the aim of miniaturizing conventional bulky optical measurement systems for application in future optical wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Low-coherence interferometry is used as the sensing principle, which allows for high performance sensing with multiple heterogeneous sensors. The entire platform with the associated electric circuit has a footprint of 2 in. × 1.8 in. × 0.75 in., which are integrated with a conventional WSN module to form an optical WSN node. The multifunctionality of the platform is successfully demonstrated for simultaneous interrogation of a Fabry–Pérot (FP) pressure sensor and a FP temperature sensor. To prove the optical sensor platform's multifunctionality, chemical sensing is also demonstrated with a FP sensor. The multifunctional optical sensor platform and the optical WSN node will enable optical WSNs, which are expected to impact many fronts including those space-constrained applications and monitoring in harsh environments.
Recording Neural Activity in Unrestrained Animals with Three-Dimensional Tracking Two-Photon Microscopy
 Optical recordings of neural activity in behaving animals can reveal the neural correlates of decision making, but brain motion, which often accompanies behavior, compromises these measurements. Two-photon point-scanning microscopy is especially sensitive to motion artifacts, and two-photon recording of activity has required rigid coupling between the brain and microscope. We developed a two-photon tracking microscope with extremely low-latency (360 μs) feedback implemented in hardware. This microscope can maintain continuous focus on neurons moving with velocities of 3 mm/s and accelerations of 1 m/s2 both in-plane and axially. We recorded calcium dynamics of motor neurons and inter-neurons in unrestrained freely behaving fruit fly larvae, correlating neural activity with stimulus presentations and behavioral outputs, and we measured light-induced depolarization of a visual interneuron in a moving animal using a genetically encoded voltage indicator. Our technique can be extended to stabilize recordings in a variety of moving substrates.
Bias voltage and current sense circuits for avalanche photodiodes
 Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are widely utilized in laser-based fiber optic systems to convert optical data into electrical form. The APD module contains the APD and a transimpedance amplifier. An optical port permits interfacing fiber optic cable to the APD's photosensitive portion. The module's compact construction facilitates a direct, low loss connection between the APD and the amplifier, necessary because of the extremely high-speed data rates involved. The receiver module needs support circuitry. The APD requires a relatively high voltage bias to operate, typically 20 to 90 V. This voltage is set by the bias supply's programming port. Additionally, it is desirable to monitor the APD's average current, which indicates optical signal strength. This information can be combined with feedback techniques to maintain optical signal strength at an optimal level. The feedback loop's operating characteristics can also determine if deleterious degradation of optical components has occurred, permitting corrective measures to be taken. APD current is typically between 100 nA and 1 mA, a dynamic range of l0,000:1. This measurement, which should be taken with an accuracy inside 1%, normally must occur in the APD's “high side,” complicating the circuit design. This restriction applies because the APD's anode is committed to the receiver amplifier's summing point. The APD module, an expensive and electrically delicate device, must be protected from damage under all conditions. The support circuitry must never produce spurious outputs which could destroy the APD module. Particular attention must be devoted to the bias supply's dynamic response under programming and power-up/down conditions. Finally, it is desirable to power the support circuitry from a single 5 V rail.
The expression of rat brain voltage-sensitive Na+ channel mRNAs in astrocytes
 Astrocytes from various regions of CNS have been shown to express voltage-activated Na+ currents. To date, three distinct subtypes (I, II and III) of Na+ channels have been cloned from rat brain. We have applied a combined technique of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine the expression of rat brain Na+ channels in rat astrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Five PCR primer sets were used to amplify coding or 3′ non-coding regions of subtype I, II, and III Na+ channels. We were able to amplify all three of these rat brain Na+ channel subtypes from rat optic nerve, which does not have neuronal cell bodies but does contain astrocytes known to express voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. In studies on cultured spinal cord astrocytes, we were also able to amplify all three subtypes of rat brain Na+ channel mRNAs. In control experiments, RT-PCR was performed on RNAs prepared from several rat tissues, including brain, skeletal muscle, and liver. Rat brain was shown to express the three Na+ channel subtypes as expected. In rat skeletal muscle, subtype I and III Na+ channel mRNAs, but not subtype II, were amplified. In rat liver, Na+ channel messages were not detectable. The present study provides the first direct evidence that astrocytes in vivo and in vitro express rat brain voltage-sensitive Na+ channel mRNAs, which have been considered as mainly neuronal-type Na+ channel messages.
Mechanisms of ischaemic damage to central white matter axons: a quantitative histological analysis using rat optic nerve
 The mechanism of ischaemic injury to white matter axons was studied by transiently depriving rat optic nerves in vitro of oxygen and glucose. Light and electron microscopic analysis showed that increasing periods of oxygen/glucose deprivation (up to 1 h) caused, after a 90-min recovery period, the appearance of increasing numbers of swollen axons whose ultrastructure indicated that they were irreversibly damaged. This conclusion was supported by experiments showing that the damage persisted after a longer recovery period (3 h). To quantify the axonal pathology, an automated morphometric method, based on measurement of the density of swollen axons, was developed. Omission of Ca2+ from the incubation solution during 1 h of oxygen/glucose deprivation (and for 15 min either side) completely prevented the axonopathy (assessed following 90 min recovery). Omission of Na+ was also effective, though less so (70% protection). The classical Na+ channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (1 μM), provided 92% protection. In view of this evidence implicating Na+ channels in the pathogenesis of the axonal damage, the effects of three different Na+ channel inhibitors, with known neuroprotective properties towards gray matter in in vivo models of cerebral ischaemia, were tested. The compounds used were lamotrigine and the structurally-related molecules, BW619C89 and BW1003C87. All three compounds protected the axons to varying degrees, the maximal efficacies (observed at 30 to 100 μM) being in the order: BW619C89 (>95% protection)>BW1003C87 (70%)>lamotrigine (50%). At a concentration affording near complete protection (100 μM), BW619C89 had no significant effect on the optic nerve compound action potential. Experiments in which BW619C89 was added at different times indicated that its effects were exerted during two distinct phases, one (accounting for about 50% protection) was during the early stage of oxygen/glucose deprivation itself and the other (also about 50%) during the first 15 min of recovery in normal incubation solution. The results are consistent with a pathophysiological mechanism in which Na+ entry through tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels contributes to Na+ loading of the axoplasm which then results in a lethal Ca2+ overload through reversed Na+–Ca2+ exchange. The identification of BW619C89 as a compound able to prevent oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced injury to white matter axons without affecting normal nerve function opens the way to testing the importance of this pathway in white matter injury in vivo.
Thermal measurement of an ester-filled power transformer at ultra-low temperatures: steady state
 At arctic ambient temperatures, the viscosity of cooling fluids for power transformers reaches extreme levels. This leads to a change of fluid flow and cooling performance, which is even more critical in case of ester fluids and cooling by means of radiators. To ensure reliable operation even under such conditions, a power transformer has been tested under different loads at ambient temperatures ranging from -50°C to -30°C. In this report, we concentrate on the measurement results for overall cooling performance in steady state. We demonstrate such surprising results as a temperature increase when outside temperature is reduced or when fans are activated for improved cooling. Both effects are due to a change of effectively used cooling surface.
A thermoelectric cooler temperature controller for fiber optic lasers
 Continued demands for increased bandwidth have resulted in the deployment of fiber-optic-based networks. The fiber optic lines, driven by solid state lasers, are capable of very high information density. Highly packed data schemes such as DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing) utilize multiple lasers driving a fiber to obtain large multichannel data streams. The narrow channel spacing relies on laser wavelength being controlled within 0.1 nm. Lasers are capable of this, but temperature variation influences operation. Typically, temperature control of 0.1°C is required to maintain laser operation well within 0.1 nm. The key to high performance temperature control is matching the controller's gain bandwidth to the thermal feedback path. Theoretically, it is a simple matter to do this using conventional servo-feedback technique. Practically, the long time constants and uncertain delays inherent in thermal systems present a challenge. The unfortunate relationship between servo systems and oscillators is very apparent in thermal control systems. The thermal control loop can be very simply modeled as a network of resistors and capacitors.
Display, recording and presentation of measurement data
 This chapter discusses about coveting the techniques available to either display measurement data for current use or record it for future use. Measurement signals in the form of a varying electrical voltage can be displayed either by an oscilloscope or else by any of the electrical meters. Electronic displays enable a parameter value to be read immediately, thus allowing for any necessary response to be made immediately. Now that computers are part of the furniture in most homes, the ability of computers to display information is widely understood and appreciated. The earliest recording instruments used were various forms of mechanical chart recorders. Mechanical chart recorders are a long-established means of making permanent records of electrical signals in a simple, cheap, and reliable way, even though they have poor dynamic characteristics, which means that they are unable to record signals at frequencies greater than about 30 Hz. The fiber optic recorder uses a fiber-optic system to direct light onto light-sensitive paper. Hybrid chart recorders represent the latest generation of chart recorders, and basically consist of a potentiometric chart recorder with an added microprocessor. The two formats available for presenting data on paper are tabular and graphical ones. A tabular presentation allows data values to be recorded in a precise way that exactly maintains the accuracy to which the data values were measured. Presentation of data in graphical form involves some compromise in the accuracy to which the data are recorded, as the exact values of measurements are lost.
Real Life Examples of Wide Area Measurement Systems
 Over the years that synchrophasor measurement technology has been used, it has become apparent that the dynamic behavior of the power system is more complex and uncertain than previously expected. With dramatic changes to the technologies used in the power sector, the combined goals of making most efficient use of the existing network, yet preventing or containing large-scale disturbances, become increasingly challenging.
Precision Laser Spectroscopy Using Acousto-Optic Modulators
 This chapter discusses a new spectroscopic method that uses a frequency-modulated laser to excite an atomic beam. It has an especially promising future given the rapid technological advances in developing new relatively inexpensive acousto-optic and electro-optic modulators. Most significantly, this new method is free of various systematic effects that have limited the accuracy of past experiments. The technique of precisely measuring frequency shifts using acousto optically modulated laser beams has been demonstrated in a number of experiments. The apparatus is relatively straightforward consisting of an atomic beam, a frequency-modulated laser beam, and a photomultiplier. Large fluorescence signals having little noise can be generated using either dye or diode lasers. The method has a number of advantages when compared with other techniques. It does not require large and uniform magnetic fields, as are needed in level crossing and in optical double resonance experiments. The data analysis is also less complicated because only a Lorentzian or Gaussian function is fitted to the observed spectral line. Short temporal resolution using relatively expensive transient digitizers is also not required, as is the case in quantum beat spectroscopy.
High resolution imaging of impacted CFRP composites with a fiber-optic laser-ultrasound scanner
 Damage induced in polymer composites by various impacts must be evaluated to predict a component’s post-impact strength and residual lifetime, especially when impacts occur in structures related to human safety (in aircraft, for example). X-ray tomography is the conventional standard to study an internal structure with high resolution. However, it is of little use when the impacted area cannot be extracted from a structure. In addition, X-ray tomography is expensive and time-consuming. Recently, we have demonstrated that a kHz-rate laser-ultrasound (LU) scanner is very efficient both for locating large defects and evaluating the material structure. Here, we show that high-quality images of damage produced by the LU scanner in impacted carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are similar to those produced by X-ray tomograms; but they can be obtained with only single-sided access to the object under study. Potentially, the LU method can be applied to large components in-situ.
Development of a fibre-optic sensor for partial discharges in oil-filled power transformers
 Determination of partial discharge locations in large oil-filled power transformers is unreliable and difficult using external acoustic sensors, and internal sensors would need to be non-metallic. Thus the use of a fibre-optic coil as an acoustic sensor would allow the detection and location of partial discharges with potentially a much greater sensitivity. This paper describes the design of such a sensor and its signal processing requirements, its construction and its initial testing. The sensor was found to be able to detect 1-Pa acoustic pressure waves under optimum conditions; and to detect partial discharges in small artificial voids in an oil-bath.
Intracellular long-wavelength voltage-sensitive dyes for studying the dynamics of action potentials in axons and thin dendrites
 In CNS neurons most of synaptic integration takes place in thin dendritic branches that are difficult to study with conventional physiological recording techniques (electrodes). When cellular compartments are too small, or too many, for electrode recordings, optical methods bring considerable advantages. Here we focused our experimental effort on the development and utilization of new kinds of voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD). The new VSDs have bluish appearance in organic solvents, and hence are dubbed “blue dyes”. They have preferred excitation windows for voltage recording that are shifted to longer wavelengths (∼660 nm). Excitation in deep red light and emission in the near-infrared render “blue VSDs” potentially useful in measurements from fluorescent structures below the tissue surface because light scattering is minimized at longer wavelengths. Seven new molecules were systematically tested using intracellular injection. In comparison to the previously used red dye (JPW-3028) the blue dyes have better sensitivity (ΔF/F) by approximately 40%. Blue dyes take little time to fill the dendritic tree, and in this aspect they are comparable with the fastest red dye JPW-3028. Based on our results, blue VSDs are well suited for experimental exploration of thin neuronal processes in semi intact preparations (brain slice). In some cases only six sweeps of temporal averaging were needed to acquire excellent records of individual action potentials in basal and oblique dendritic branches, or in axons and axon collaterals up to 200 μm away from the cell body. Signal-to-noise ratio of these recordings was ∼10. The combination of blue dyes and laser illumination approach imposed little photodynamic damage and allowed the total number of recording sweeps per cell to exceed 100. Using these dyes and a spot laser illumination technique, we demonstrate the first recording of action potentials in the oblique dendrite and distal axonal segment of the same pyramidal cell.
The biology of voltage-gatedsodium channels
 This chapter discusses the biology of voltage-gated sodium channels. Voltage-gated sodium channels are the primary mediators of the propagating action potential of nerve and muscle—the fundamental phenomenon by which various elements of the nervous system communicate. Sodium channels are the major targets of a variety of natural toxins and several clinically important drug classes, such as local anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, and antiseizure drugs. As with other ion channels, within a given organism, sodium channels are encoded by a number of genes, while there are indications that RNA processing events that vary the protein sequences encoded by individual genes may generate further diversity. The consideration of the biological significance of such sodium channel isoforms is the major theme of the chapter. It reviews the basic functional properties of sodium channels and their role in various excitation phenomena in nerve and muscle; this is followed by a brief account of the current state of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of these sodium channel functions. The chapter also describes the molecular diversity of the sodium channel family and the various transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms that are responsible.
Voltage- and Current-Clamp Methods for Determination of Planar Lipid Bilayer Properties
 Biological membranes, the barriers that envelope the cell and its inner organelles, play a crucial role in the normal functioning of cells. The simplest model of these biological membranes is the planar lipid bilayer. Because its geometry allows chemical and electrical access to both sides of the bilayer, the physical properties of this model membrane can be easily measured. Usually, a thin bimolecular film composed of specified phospholipids and organic solvent is formed on a small aperture in a hydrophobic partition separating two compartments containing aqueous solutions. From the electrical point of view, a planar lipid bilayer can be considered as an imperfect capacitor; therefore, two electrical properties, capacitance (C) and resistance (R), determine most of its behavior. Electrodes placed in the aqueous compartments on each side of the planar lipid bilayer permit the measurement of current and voltage across the model membrane. The two measuring techniques most commonly used to measure the properties of planar lipid bilayers are voltage-clamp methods and current-clamp methods. The focus of this chapter is to review measurement systems and methods for the determination of the physical properties of planar lipid bilayers.
Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channels
 The transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are encoded by ∼30 distinct genes in mammals. TRP channels may be generally described as cation channels that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. They are activated by diverse stimuli such as changes in temperature, pH, and osmolarity, and are modulated by growth factor and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways. TRPs thus integrate multiple concomitant stimuli as cellular sensors. They are grouped into six subfamilies, named C, V, M, A, P, and ML, on the basis of amino acid sequence homology: canonical, vanilloid, melastatin, ankyrin repeat, polycystins, and mucolipins, respectively.
A system for the measurements of lightning currents at the Säntis Tower
 The paper presents the characteristics of a system suitably developed to measure lightning current waveforms on the Säntis Tower in Switzerland. The paper first describes the configuration of the system then presents the characteristics of the measurement equipment, in terms of bandwidth and accuracy, inferred by means of experimental tests. Finally, we present and discuss examples of waveforms measured using the system.
Electro-optic properties of c-axis oriented LiNbO3 films grown on Si(1 0 0) substrate
 We developed a spectroscopic–ellipsometric approach to evaluate the electro-optic coefficient of highly c-axis oriented LiNbO3 films on an Si(1 0 0) substrate grown by electron cyclotron resonance plasma sputtering. Applying an electric field between the TiN transparent top electrode and Si substrate, the interference fringe appearing in the tan Ψ spectrum was slightly modulated by phase retardation in the wavelength domain. The change in effective wavelength was converted to refractive index change, yielding dispersion in the Pockels coefficient (r33) between 0.3 and 0.8 μm. At 633 nm, we obtained an r33 that was 57% of the bulk LN crystal value.
Liquid crystal light valve with a semiconductor substrate for dynamic holography in the infrared
 Recording of dynamic holograms in the near infrared spectral range is reported for a liquid crystal light valve with a GaAs semi-insulating substrate. The interaction of weak signal and strong pump waves are studied. It is demonstrated that an out-of-phase local dynamic grating is recorded. Optimal amplitude and frequency of the applied voltage are found for maximum amplification of the weak beam. Step-like external phase modulation of the signal wave with amplitude π/2 is used to change the type of response from local to nonlocal and to achieve in such a way additional transient signal beam amplification. Study of the cells with different thicknesses of the liquid crystal layer at different grating spacings allows a seventeen-fold gain of the weak beam in the device with the thickest liquid crystal layer of 16 μm at a grating period of 1000 μm (the largest possible in our set-up). The amplitude of the refractive index modulation and nonlinear coupling constant n2 are estimated from the experimental results.
Picosecond transient grating measurements of singlet exciton transport in anthracene single crystals
 Picosecond transient grating experiments are used to measure the rate of exciton transport in anthracene single crystals. The method permits a direct measurement of the transport by introducing an accurate distance scale into the sample. Results from transient grating experiments at 10 K are presented, and the diffusion constant along the â crystal axis for the anthracene singlet exciton is reported. Preliminary studies of the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion constant are also discussed.
Radiation testing of fiber optic systems
 Tests have been performed to examine the effects of radiation exposure on opto-electronic components that can be used in digital fiber optic data links. The response of fiber waveguides to ionizing radiation has been studied. Measurements of the growth and decay of the radiation-induced loss at 850 and 1300 nm have revealed that fibers are very sensitive to low γ-doses (2000 rad). The linear dependence of a short circuit current on a γ-dose rate, up to 380 rad/s for the photodiode has been shown. At very high dose levels permanent damage is noticed in the diode characteristics and its current decreases where a value of 1600 μA, measured at light intensity level of 8000 1x, was reduced to 1200, 950, 820, 700, 600 and 550 μA after γ-exposure up to 2.0, 16, 38, 70, 105 and 140 M rad respectively. The forward current gain factor of a phototransistor, measured as a function of operating collector current, shows a severe decrease due to γ-exposure. The minimum damage effects, usually correspond to the lower and higher ends of the operating collector current range of a device. Proposals using photodiodes for γ-dose and dose rate-dosimetry are given, tested and proved to be satisfactory.
Measurement of GPCR-G protein activity in living cells
 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface receptors in eukaryotic genomes. They control a variety of cellular and physiological processes such as hormone secretion and heart rate, and therefore are associated with a majority of pathological conditions including cancer and heart diseases. Currently established assays to measure ligand-induced activation of GPCRs and G proteins possess limitations such as being time consuming, indirect, and expensive. Thus, an efficient method to measure GPCR-G protein activation is required to identify novel pharmacological modulators to control them and gain insights about molecular underpinnings of the associated pathways. Activation of GPCRs induces dissociation of G protein heterotrimers to form GαGTP and free Gβγ. Free Gβγ subunits have been shown to translocate reversibly from the plasma membrane to internal membranes. Gβγ translocation therefore represents the GPCR-G protein activation, and thus, imaging of this process can be used to quantify the kinetics and magnitude of the pathway activation–deactivation in real time in living cells. The objective of this chapter is to elaborate the protocols of (i) generation and optimization of the required sensor constructs; (ii) development of cell culture, transient transfection, imaging, and optogenetic procedures; (iii) imaging and data analysis methods; and (iv) stable cell line generation, pertaining to this assay to measure GPCR-G protein activation.
A non-conventional instrument transformer
 The paper describes a non-conventional instrument transformer (NCIT) offering the possibility of adapting the measuring points in the high-voltage power network to new states as a result of the impact of intermittent renewable energy resources, harmonic distortions evoked by switching apparatus and smart-grid systems, enabling prompt and accurate measurements in a wider frequency range at a higher dynamics, and providing more reliable operation of the power network. The features of the proposed NCIT are in using the low-power current transformers (LPCT) and in the measuring and processing electronics which are situated partially on the potential of high voltage (HV) line and partially on earth potential.
Requirements and proposals for control and monitoring measurements of the HCLL TBM
 Test Blanket Modules (TBM) operation shall not impact the ITER machine safety/availability. The monitoring of all the features relevant for the control and safe operation of the systems will therefore be indispensable. Under this perspective, the control and monitoring parameters to be measured in the Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) TBM system are summarized and tabulated in this paper. Relevant sensors’ range and operating conditions are indicated. Their environmental and geometrical constraints in the TBM and its systems are reported. The most suitable sensors and/or measuring techniques are then suggested. Required characteristics are checked against off-the-shelf ones, when available, and needed development for their adaptation to the TBM environment is identified.
A CMOS integrated low-voltage low-power time-controlled interface for chemical resistive sensors
 In this paper, an innovative integrated interface circuit, suitable for wide range resistive sensors, such as chemical devices for gas sensing, is presented. The key characteristic is the ability to overcome the main limit of the circuits based on the resistance-to-time (R–T) conversion, that is the long measuring time occurring in the evaluation of high-value resistances. The proposed solution is based on a tricky oscillating circuit architecture performing a sort of “compression” of the higher part of the resistive range, thus limiting the measuring time. The interface is oriented to the development of a single chip for resistive chemical sensor applications, thus it is designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing only operational amplifiers (OAs) and passive components. The proposed front-end is capable to estimate both the sensor resistance over a wide range (five decades) and, through the AC excitation voltage of the sensor, the in-parallel parasitic capacitance, for diagnosis purposes or to provide a more complete characterization of the sensor. Preliminary experimental measurements, conducted through a fabricated discrete component prototype PCB and utilizing commercial sample resistors and capacitors to emulate sensor behaviour, have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach in a wide resistive range. Further experimental results, achieved through the fabricated integrated circuit, developed in 0.35 μm standard CMOS technology, have shown good performance both for resistance and capacitance estimations. The on-chip integrated solution, requiring a silicon area of about 0.9 mm2, supplied at 1.8 V and showing a low power consumption (lower than 600 μW), results to be suitable for resistive sensor array configurations and portable applications, as also witnessed by an experimental test with CO gas and a sample commercial sensor.
A Thermo-optically controllable saturable absorber for switchable operation of a fiber laser between Q-switching and harmonic mode-locking
 A thermo-optically controllable fiberized saturable absorber (SA) that is based on a combination of graphene oxide (GO), a thermo-optic polymer adhesive, and a thermo-electric temperature controller (TEC), is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By incorporating the SA into an all-fiberized erbium-doped fiber (EDF) ring cavity, an operation-state-switchable fiber laser is successfully implemented. The operation state of the laser is shown to be switchable from a continuous wave (CW) to the Q-switching state to the harmonic mode-locking state depending on the current that is applied to the TEC under a fixed pump-power condition. As a function of the applied current, the temporal width and the repetition rate of the Q-switched pulses varied from ~5.54 μs to ~12.35 μs and from ~ 31.02 kHz to ~17.25 kHz, respectively. The maximum pulse energy is ~52.8 nJ. In the harmonic-mode-locking state, the 19th order of the harmonic-mode-locked pulses was generated. The pulse width was measured as ~595 fs with a pulse-repetition rate of ~237.5 MHz. It is believed that the operation-mode change is due to the variations of the insertion loss and the beam-polarization status of the implemented SA that are due to the temperature-variation-induced refractive-index changes of the thermo-optic polymer.
Optical Recording System Based on a Fiber Optic Image Conduit: Assessment of Microscopic Activation Patterns in Cardiac Tissue
 Optical recording of transmembrane voltage changes with the use of potentiometric dyes has opened the possibility of determining spatial patterns of electrical activity in excitable tissues. To follow such activation patterns on the cellular/subcellular level in heart cell cultures, a recording system was developed that features both high spatial resolution (4–200 μm) and high temporal resolution (uncertainty in the determination of delays between fast rising signals of ±1 μs). Central to the system is a fiber optic image conduit consisting of 379 individual optical fibers. At one end the fibers are fused to form an input window that matches the size of the field of view of the microscope. At the other end, the fibers are loose, permitting a selectable subset to be connected to 80 discrete photodetectors. This design allows the sensitive area of the imager to be adapted to regions of interest in a given preparation, thus making optimal use of the limited number of detectors. Furthermore, by using a second fiber optic imager, individual photodetectors can be assigned to different optical ports, thus providing the means for fast and simultaneous dual-emission wavelength measurements. This feature permitted the elimination of motion artifacts arising from the myocytes without the use of contraction-suppressing drugs.
Three-dimensional resistivity characterization of a coastal area: Application of Grounded Electrical-Source Airborne Transient Electromagnetic (GREATEM) survey data from Kujukuri Beach, Japan
 An airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey using the Grounded Electrical-Source Airborne Transient Electromagnetic (GREATEM) system was conducted over the Kujukuri coastal plain in southeast Japan to assess the system's ability to accurately describe the geological structure beneath shallow seawater. To obtain high-quality data with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio, a series of data processing techniques were used to obtain the final transient response curves from the field survey data. These steps included movement correction, coordinate transformation, the removal of local noise, data stacking, and signal portion extraction. We performed numerical forward modeling to generate a three-dimensional (3D) resistivity structure model from the GREATEM data. This model was developed from an initial one-dimensional (1D) resistivity structure that was also inverted from the GREATEM field survey data. We modified a 3D electromagnetic forward-modeling scheme based on a finite-difference staggered-grid method and used it to calculate the response of the 3D resistivity model along each survey line. We verified the model by examining the fit of the magnetic-transient responses between field data and the 3D forward-model computed data, the latter of which were convolved with the measured system responses of the corresponding data set. The inverted 3D resistivity structures showed that the GREATEM system has the capability to map resistivity structures as far as 800 m offshore and as deep as 300–350 m underground in coastal areas of relatively shallow seawater depth (5–10 m).
Infrared thermography measurement of two-phase boiling flow heat transfer in a microchannel
 In this study, a non-intrusive method to directly measure the fluid temperature and two-phase flow patterns in micro-scale system was developed. To achieve this goal, an adequate calibration process of infrared (IR) thermography measurement and an experimental design of IR transparent convective flow in a microchannel were established. The temperature distribution of the fluid along the microchannel was measured by IR thermography through a germanium window of thickness 5 mm. The transparent germanium window was used to facilitate the transmission of long-wavelength IR rays. The infrared images were obtained at a frame rate of 200 fps, which enabled observation of the transient temperature behavior during flow boiling in the microchannel. A semi-transparent liquid, namely ethanol, was used as the working fluid, with a mass flux of 20.3 kg/m2s and heat flux range of 3.1–244.1 kW/m2. The experimental results confirmed that IR thermography could be used to capture the transient single- and two-phase flow patterns as well as the fluid temperature along the channel. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first presentation of IR visualization of two-phase flow patterns in a microchannel. The trends of the local heat transfer coefficients with respect to the two-phase flow patterns are discussed, and the experimentally determined coefficients are compared with those calculated by commonly used equations.
Applications for optical current and voltage sensors
 The construction and use of optical sensors for the measurement of electric current and voltage is described. The voltage sensor uses the electrooptic effect of Bi4(GeO4)3. The range is ±6 kV with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1500 for a 10 MHz system. The temperature stability is better than 5% in the range 20 – 85 °C. Both fibre and bulk optical current sensors were investigated. The range, signal-to-noise ratio and temperature stability of the bulk sensor depend on the Faraday rotator used. Typical values are 2 kA, 2000 and 2.5% respectively. The use of the fibre current sensor as a fast lightning detector is demonstrated. The voltage and bulk current sensors are applied in a transformer protection system.
Ward-Type Equivalents for Transient Stability Analysis
 This paper presents a methodology for a dynamic equivalent that is attached to the internal nodes of the generators. The equivalent results from the elimination of constant PQ load buses while taking into account the changes in the load bus voltage phasors that are driven by the machine angles. Since the loads are not governed by differential equations, static-type equivalencing techniques are employed. In this paper, the Ward equivalent is considered. The equivalent injection currents are derived from piecewise linearization of the system model. Simulation results show that the method is accurate for wide changes in the operating point. In addition, it dramatically reduces the computing time of the transient stability analysis.
High-speed opto-electronic transient waveform digitiser
 Current military applications require data to be digitised at rates exceeding 10 GSa/s with 8-bit resolution or more. This is far in excess of the performance of current commercial monolithic electronic ADCs. In fact, the ADC is often a limiting factor in the overall system performance. This paper describes a transient waveform digitiser that uses an optical technique to convert a single (electrical) signal into a series of time-delayed copies. Traditional repetitive sampling techniques are then used to achieve a high overall sampling rate. Results are presented for a prototype digitiser operating at 16 GSa/s with 8-bit resolution.
Basic Instrumentation for Optical Measurement
 This chapter introduces a number of basic optical measurement instruments and functional devices, focusing on the discussion of the basic operating principles, general specifications, unique advantages, and limitations of each measurement tool. An optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) based on diffraction gratings is one of the most useful pieces of instruments in fiber-optic system and device measurement, especially when wavelength division multiplexing is introduced into the systems where different data channels are carried by different wavelengths. In addition to being able to identify the wavelength of an optical signal, an OSA is often used to find optical signal power level at each wavelength channel, evaluate optical signal-to-noise ratio and optical crosstalk, and check the optical bandwidth when an optical carrier is modulated. An ultra-high-resolution OSA can be made using a scanning Fabry–Perot interferometer (FPI). The Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is one of the oldest optical instruments, in use for more than a century. The basic configuration of an MZI consists of two optical beam splitters (combiners) and two mirrors to alter beam directions. The optical configuration of a Michelson interferometer is similar to that of an MZI except that only one beam splitter is used and the optical signal passes bidirectionally in the interferometer arms. The most popular optical wavelength meter is based on a Michelson interferometer, which is structurally simpler than an OSA and can easily be made into a small package using fiber-optic components. The polarimeter is an instrument that can be used to measure the state of polarization of a lightwave signal; it is useful in many applications, such as optical system monitoring and characterization. Furthermore, this chapter discusses the fundamental principle of coherent detection, which helps in the understanding of linear optical sampling and vectorial optical network analyzers.
Free-running waveform characterization using a delay-time tunable laser based delay-line-free electro-optic sampling oscilloscope
 We develop a delay-line-free and frequency traceable electro-optic sampling oscilloscope by use of a digital phase-locked loop phase shifter (PLL-PS) controlled delay-time-tunable gain-switched laser diode (GSLD). The home-made voltage-controllable PLL-PS exhibits a linear transfer function with ultra-wide phase shifting range of ±350° and tuning error of <±5%, which benefits the advantages of frequency tracking to free-running signals with suppressed timing-jitter. The maximum delay-time of PLL-PS controlled GSLD is up to 1.95 periods by changing the controlling voltage (VREF) from −3.5 to 3.5 V, which corresponds to 3.9 ns at repetition frequency of 500 MHz. The tuning responsivity and resolution are about 0.56 ns/V and 0.15∼0.2 ps, respectively. The maximum delay-time switching bandwidth of 100 Hz is determined under the control of a saw-tooth modulated VREF function. The waveform sampling of microwave PECL signals generated from a free-running digital frequency divider is performed with acceptable measuring deviation.
Enhancement of IR emission from a dislocation network in Si due to an external bias voltage
 Si-based light emitters with efficient emission at 1.5 or 1.3 μm are required for on-chip optical interconnection for the ultra large scale integrated circuits in the future. In this paper, we have shown that dislocation networks in Si formed by direct wafer bonding emit a quartet of luminescence D-lines. The D-line spectrum can be tailored by the structure of the dislocation network. The D1 or D3, with a wavelength of 1.5 or 1.3 μm respectively, can be made dominating in the luminescence spectrum. An external bias voltage applied to the bonded interface can significantly enhance the luminescence intensity of D-lines.
THz near-field measurements of metal structures
 We report on electro-optic measurements of THz electric fields in the near-field of metal structures lying on GaP electro-optic sampling crystals. With (110) oriented crystals, the x or y component of the THz electric field is measured, whereas with a (001) oriented crystal, the z-component is measured. With an estimated spatial resolution of 20 μm, the technique allows us to map the field on a scale, orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial dimensions of these structures. We illustrate the technique by showing results of measurements of the THz electric field in a plane underneath a metal sphere and a single square hole in a metal foil. The technique provides us with a wealth of information on the time-evolution of light fields near metal structures. To cite this article: A.J.L. Adam et al., C. R. Physique 9 (2008).
Ultrasonic Exposimetry and Acoustic Measurements
 Ultrasound measurements center on transducers. Key data are the electrical impedance, pulse–echo signal, and spectrum and beam characteristics. Materials to make transducers as well as piezoelectrics, tissues, targets, and phantom materials are studied for their acoustic impedance, backscattering properties, absorption as a function of frequency, directivity, and anisotropy. Characteristics of phased arrays include element-to-element variability in impedance, pulse echo, sensitivity, crosstalk element directivity, and electrical (capacitance, opens, shorts) and beamformed acoustic field. Acoustic output measurements are made by radiation force balances and hydrophones, which need calibration and adhere to prescribed measurement protocols for imaging systems according to national and international regulations and standards. Performance of ultrasound methods can be evaluated by use of specialized phantoms. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) poses special acoustic output measurements that are under development but already are done with force balances, alternate targets, buoyancy force balances, optical and specialized hydrophones, and hybrid measurement-simulation methods for acoustic output and thermal rise prediction.
Bio-inspired optic flow sensors based on FPGA: Application to Micro-Air-Vehicles
 Tomorrow’s Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAVs) could be used as scouts in many civil and military missions without any risk to human life. MAVs have to be equipped with sensors of several kinds for stabilization and guidance purposes. Many recent findings have shown, for example, that complex tasks such as 3-D navigation can be performed by insects using optic flow (OF) sensors although insects’ eyes have a rather poor spatial resolution. At our Laboratory, we have been performing electrophysiological, micro-optical, neuroanatomical and behavioral studies for several decades on the housefly’s visual system, with a view to understanding the neural principles underlying OF detection and establishing how OF sensors might contribute to performing basic navigational tasks. Based on these studies, we developed a functional model for an Elementary Motion Detector (EMD), which we first transcribed into electronic terms in 1986 and subsequently used onboard several terrestrial and aerial robots. Here we present a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of an EMD array, which was designed for estimating the OF in various parts of the visual field of a MAV. FPGA technology is particularly suitable for applications of this kind, where a single Integrated Circuit (IC) can receive inputs from several photoreceptors of similar (or different) shapes and sizes located in various parts of the visual field. In addition, the remarkable characteristics of present-day FPGA applications (their high clock frequency, large number of system gates, embedded RAM blocks and Intellectual Property (IP) functions, small size, light weight, low cost, etc.) make for the flexible design of a multi-EMD visual system and its installation onboard MAVs with extremely low permissible avionic payloads.
Electric linear dichroism study of some Sudan dyes using electro-optic and spectroscopic methods
 Contrast ratios CR and order parameters S of Sudan black B and solutions containing two phenolic Sudan dyes (Sudan III and Sudan IV) in nematic solvents (E7 and E8) were investigated using polarized spectroscopy in a guest–host system based on homogeneous–homeotropic alignment. The orientation of the dye molecules was controlled using an electric field, and this enabled the contrast ratio of the dye to be obtained by electrically switching. The transient molecular reorientation and linear electric dichroism of the guest–host system (Sudan black B-E8) was also investigated in an electro-optical system using the rectangular-shaped pulsed electric field. Moreover, temperature dependence of the order parameter of Sudan black B in the nematic host was studied.
Optically measured NADH concentrations are unaffected by propofol induced EEG silence during transient cerebral hypoperfusion in anesthetized rabbits
 The neuroprotective benefit of intra-operative anesthetics is widely described and routinely aimed to invoke electroencephalographic (EEG) silence in anticipation of transient cerebral ischemia. Previous rat survival studies have questioned an additional benefit from achieving EEG silence during transient global cerebral hypoperfusion. Surgical preparation on twelve New Zealand white rabbits under ketamine–propofol anesthesia, included placement of skull screws for bilateral EEG monitoring, skull shaving for laser Doppler probes, and a 5 mm diameter right temporal craniotomy for the NADH probe. Transient global cerebral hypoperfusion was achieved with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and pharmacologically induced systemic hypotension. All animals acted as controls, and had cerebral hypoperfusion under baseline propofol anesthesia with an active EEG. Thereafter, animals were randomized to receive bolus injection of intracarotid (3–5 mg) or intravenous (10–20 mg) 1% propofol to create EEG silence for 1–2 min. The data collected at baseline, peak hypoperfusion, and 5 and 10 min post hypoperfusion was analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni–Dunn test. Eleven of the twelve rabbits completed the protocol. Hemodynamics and cerebral blood flow changes were comparable in all the animals. Compared to controls, the increase in NADH during ischemia was unaffected by EEG silence with either intravenous or intraarterial propofol. We failed to observe any significant additional attenuation of the elevation in NADH levels with propofol induced EEG silence during transient global cerebral hypoperfusion. This is consistent with previous rat survival studies showing that EEG silence was not required for full neuroprotective effects of pentothal anesthesia.
Fiber-optic techniques for generating and detecting ultrasonic waves for quantitative NDE
 This paper describes a method that uses pulsed laser light and coherent light interferometry in a fiber-optic-based system for non-contact generation and detection of ultrasound. Fiber-optic bundles are used to construct a rugged and versatile system to deliver geometrically conditioned, high-energy laser pulses capable of generating ultrasonic signals. In addition, an actively stabilized, multi-channel fiber-optic interferometric system for detecting these signals is described.
Rotational Motion Transducers
 This chapter is concerned with the measurement of rotational (angular) movement in the form of displacement, velocity, and acceleration motion. The discussion on measuring rotation displacement starts with circular and helical potentiometers and then looks in turn at the merits of the rotational differential transformer, incremental shaft encoder, coded-disk shaft encoder, resolver, synchro, rotary inductosyn, and both the free and rate-integrating gyroscope. Moving on to the measurement of rotational velocity, the various forms of digital tachometer available are explored before considering stroboscopic methods, analog tachometers and the two forms of gyroscope that measure rotational velocity, the rate gyro and the fiber-optic gyro. Finally, the subject of rotational acceleration measurement is considered. Separate sections during the course of the chapter also consider the calibration techniques used for the various measurement devices covered.
Dynamic behavior of electro-optic and strain-optic effects in ferroelectrics with diffuse phase transitions
 The transverse electro-optic effect under the step-function electric field in PMN single crystals and PLZT ceramics has been investigated. The time and temperature dependences of the electro-optic coefficients g11–g12 and R11–R12 have been determined. The strain-optic contribution to the total electro-optic effect has been evaluated. The influence of the polar phase regions on the electro-optic properties and their clamping is discussed.
An algorithm for cost optimization of PMU and communication infrastructure in WAMS
 Power system state estimation relies increasingly on PMU measurements to effectively control and monitor growing and stressed transmission networks which are also affected by transient and dynamic events. High PMU cost has motivated optimal PMU placement solutions but recent works have shown the effect of communication infrastructure cost in PMU configuration. In this paper, we present a new method for the design of Wide Area Measurement Systems. A topological analysis algorithm based on the Variable Neighbourhood Search heuristic is proposed and tested in several networks, including the common IEEE test networks and the 5804-bus Brazilian transmission system. Our results show the flexibility, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed methodology when compared with recent research presented in the literature.
Action potential waveform voltage-clamp commands reveal striking differences in calcium entry via low and high voltage activated calcium channels
 Calcium channels transduce natural voltage transients, like action potentials, into functionally important intracellular calcium transients. We have used digitally constructed waveforms that simulate natural action potentials as voltage-clamp commands to study channel function in transduction. Whole-cell calcium currents elicited by several action potential waveforms (APWs) were studied. The currents were subdivided into T (or low voltage-activated) and high voltage-activated components. Calcium entry through T channels constituted a disproportionately large fraction of the total during normal, brief APWs. Entry through high voltage-activated channels was much more responsive to APW, increasing more significantly as APW duration increased. Thus the results indicate that differences in the gating properties of these two channel classes combine to endow them with strikingly different transducer properties.
MEASUREMENT BASED CONTROL OF POWER SYSTEMS
 This chapter provides an overview of measurement-based control of power systems. The measurements are generally of fundamental frequency components of the signals in the presence of extraneous components in the power system voltage and current signals. Although measurements at such high speed are necessary in relaying applications, slower measurements have better accuracy and are therefore more desirable for power system monitoring and control tasks. As the measurements provide symmetrical components of voltages and currents, positive sequence quantities can be used in the monitoring and control tasks. The power system models used in these applications is the positive sequence model; it is therefore desirable that a consistent measurement set be used. The phasor representation of power system voltages and currents can be viewed as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of their data samples. Phasor calculations can be performed over one period, or over a fraction of a period. Longer the data window used for phasor calculation, better is the accuracy of its estimate. If the power system frequency changes from its nominal value, the phasor rotates in the complex plane at a speed proportional to the shift in frequency. Consequently, the recursive DFT offers a very sensitive and accurate frequency measuring system. There are three practical alternative techniques for synchronization of clocks to this accuracy: the first one is the navigational-aid transmission, the second alternative is the use of satellite transmissions, and the third alternative is the use of a direct communication channel between substations—preferably a fiber-optic channel.
Development of transient current and charge techniques for the measurement of effective net concentration of ionized charges (Neff) in the space charge region of p-n junction detectors
 Transient current and charge techniques (TCT/TChT) have been developed as alternatives to the standard C-V measurements for measurements of the effective net concentration of ionized charges (Neff) in the space charge region (SCR) of Si p-n junction detectors, especially for heavily irradiated detectors. This paper contains the physical background of the techniques, modeling of current and charge pulse response, and applications of the methods to the characterizations of silicon planar detectors designed for high energy physics.
Voltage-gated calcium channels are involved in the regulation of calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle cells from isolated porcine retinal arterioles
 Disturbances in the regulation of retinal arteriolar tone are involved in the pathophysiology of major vision threatening diseases. Therefore, improving the treatment of these diseases requires knowledge about how the contraction of retinal arterioles is controlled. The present study hypothesized that in addition to calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium entry from the extracellular space is also involved in the generation of calcium oscillations as a basis for initiation of contraction in retinal arterioles. Isolated porcine retinal arterioles were mounted in a confocal microvascular myograph and loaded with the calcium sensitive fluorophore Oregon Green allowing simultaneous measurements of oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration in individual smooth muscle cells and changes in the vascular tone. Recordings were made after pre-contraction with the thromboxane analogue U46619 in a low and a high ambient calcium concentration, and after subsequent blocking of voltage-gated calcium channels using nifedipine or the sarcoplasmic reticulum dependent calcium recruitment using ryanodine, caffeine, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid. U46619 increased the number of oscillations in a low but not in physiological extracellular calcium concentration. In contrast to mesenteric arterioles, blocking of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels with ryanodine was without effect on both retinal arteriolar tone and calcium oscillations. Conversely, blocking of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump with cyclopiazonic acid or thapsigargin significantly reduced calcium oscillations, but not arteriolar tone. At a physiological extracellular calcium concentration, addition of nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced vascular tone but increased the number of cells displaying calcium oscillations. Fast oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration in retinal smooth muscle cells depend on calcium transport by both the SR and the sarcolemma. However, both sites of calcium recruitment seem to have unique properties in porcine retinal arterioles as compared to other organs.
Ultrahigh-bandwidth vector network analyzer based on external electro-optic sampling
 We report the development of an ultrahigh-bandwidth vector network analyzer useful for small-signal characterization of high-speed semiconductor devices. It employs 100-fs optical pulses for making terahertz-bandwidth electro-optic measurements of electrical signals, as well as for sub-picosecond, photoconductive, electrical-stimulus-signal generation. High-bandwidth coplanar strip transmission lines are used for signal transmission. A 0.15 × 50 μm gate AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs HFET has been characterized over a bandwidth of 100 GHz using this network analyzer. A comparison with conventional RF network analyzer measurements performed to 40 GHz demonstrated good agreement throughout this bandwidth. Such measurements of the actual device characteristics across their entire operating frequency range should improve device development and incorporation into active circuits.
Measurement of Magnetic Fields
 The measurement of magnetic fields is needed at all points in the experimental characterization of magnetic materials. A classical way to reveal and measure a magnetic field is by means of a closed-loop winding, where an electromotive force is detected, according to the Faraday–Maxwell law of electromagnetic induction, proportional to the time derivative of the linked flux. Magneto-elastic and magneto-optic effects are also frequently exploited for the sake of field sensing. The flux is measured either by extraction, inversion of the DC current or by using an AC current source. The calibration is therefore traceable to the quantum standards of voltage, resistance, and frequency. An alternative method consists in comparing the coil with a standard mutual inductance using an AC bridge. A popular application of search coils is related to the mapping of the field generated by electromagnets, magnets assemblies, and other sources. A sensing coil made to vibrate by a small motor or a piezoelectric transducer is sensitive to the space gradient of the magnetic field. A magnetized open sample generates a nonuniform field in its neighborhood, whose presence can be detected by means of a vibrating search coil.
Use of polymeric materials for external electro-optic probing
 The present paper offers a computational look into a new and potentially exciting area of external electro-optic probing. The benefits that might be derived from substituting polymeric materials as a prober tip for measuring fast electrical waveforms are presented. The large reduction of the perturbation of microwave circuits when tested by external electro-optic probing is calculated for the organic system PMMA/Disperse Red. This is an example for an organic prober tip material with an extremly low permittivity and good nonlinear optical quality and compared to the perturbation due to standard inorganic prober tip materials like LiNbO3 or KD∗P.
Measurement
 This chapter deals with the multiphase flow meter. The major parts of the TopFlow meter are the Venturi insert and the electrodes inside the Venturi throat. The flow rates of oil, water, and gas are calculated based on the measurements performed by the electrodes and the measurement of the differential pressure across the Venturi inlet. The TopFlow meter utilizes a capacitance sensor for oil-continuous liquid mixtures, where the capacitance caused by the dielectric constant of the fluid mixture is measured in the throat of the Venturi. Similarly, it utilizes a four-electrode conductance sensor for water-continuous liquid mixtures, where the conductance is caused by the conductivity of the fluid mixture. All the necessary electrodes are incorporated within a Venturi that is somewhat modified. Advanced data processing is utilized to have continuous readings of the flow rates of oil, water, and gas.
A conceptual development of novel ultra-precision dimensional measurement technology
 This research explores the unique physical phenomenon of electrical output versus displacement of a potentiometer with the view of nano-scope. Based on the interesting characters of the phenomenon, a novel conceptual development of ultra-precision dimensional measurement technology is carried out. As an example, a potentiometer and a stack of piezoelectric elements are adopted to build a dual-stage ultra-precision measurement instrument. The theoretical error analysis with the research demonstrates that an instrument developed with this novel ultra-precision dimensional measurement technology is able to achieve low double-digital nanometer absolute measurement accuracy over a large dimensional range.
An absorbance-based fiber-optic sensor for CO2(aq) measurement in porewaters of sea floor sediments
 We present results of the construction, testing and calibration of a sensor designed for in situ measurement of CO2(aq) concentrations in porewaters of sea floor sediments. The sensor relies on pH-dependent absorbance changes of a dye-containing solution enclosed within a gas-permeable membrane. It is rugged enough to withstand insertion several centimeters in sediments without damage, and small enough to make measurements separated spatially by ≤ 2 mm. Response time at 20 °C is a few minutes. Calibration results imply that the sensor is capable of resolving differences in CO2(aq) concentration of ± 8%, or about 2–3 × 10−6 M, and is stable over time scales of several hours. Preliminary results from two sea floor locations in the equatorial Atlantic of depths 3300 and 4700 m are qualitatively consistent with simultaneous, adjacent pH electrode measurements. Sensor performance could be improved by adding a system for in situ reagent delivery, and by monitoring a non-absorbing wavelength in the dye absorbance spectrum to decrease dependence on the dye concentration of the internal solution.
Picosecond electro-optic sampling of electron-hole vertical transport in surface space charge fields
 The longitudinal electro-optic effect in GaAs(100) is used to measure the dynamics of electron-hole pair separation in surface space charge fields present at GaAs/oxide interfaces. At low photocarrier injection, the rise time in the E field transient is a direct measurement of the charge transport across the space charge field which is found to be faster than 500 fs. The results demonstrate that the charge carriers are energetically unthermalized at the surface prior to the surface chemistry. This method is also found to be sensitive to 10−5 of a monolayer of charged surface states.
Experimental characterization of the perturbations of microwave devices by the electro-optic probe tip
 Disturbances induced by the electro-optic probe tip of an indirect electro-optic test system are studied experimentally and compared to simulations. It is shown that the probe tip can have a significant influence on the behaviour of the device under test (DUT) when not optimally positioned.
An electrophysiological study of the action of N-methyl-d-aspartate on excitatory synaptic transmission in the optic tectum of the frog in vitro
 Excitatory synaptic field potentials, induced by stimulating optic nerve fibers, were recorded from in vitro preparations of the optic tectum of the frog. Bath-applied N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), glutamate or quisqualate elicited transient enhancement in these field potentials, followed by a sustained depression reversible on washout. Responses to glutamate or quisqualate and the amplitude of control synaptic potentials, were not affected by the NMDA receptor antagonists aminophosphonovalerate (APV), 3(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP), ketamine, magnesium ions or dizocipiline (MK 801) which, on the other hand, blocked the effects of NMDA. The antagonist dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), which is preferential for non-NMDA receptors, blocked the action of glutamate and synaptic transmission. In the presence of strychnine, glycine reversed the block of NMDA-mediated responses caused by magnesium. It is suggested that in the optic tectum of the frog, glutamate is the excitatory transmitter of at least one class of optic nerve fibres and that it acts through non-NMDA receptors. Although this area of the brain contains a well-developed NMDA receptor system, its function in physiological synaptic transmission remains to be elucidated.
Hypoglycemic seizures during transient hypoglycemia exacerbate hippocampal dysfunction
 Severe hypoglycemia constitutes a medical emergency, involving seizures, coma and death. We hypothesized that seizures, during limited substrate availability, aggravate hypoglycemia-induced brain damage. Using immature isolated, intact hippocampi and frontal neocortical blocks subjected to low glucose perfusion, we characterized hypoglycemic (neuroglycopenic) seizures in vitro during transient hypoglycemia and their effects on synaptic transmission and glycogen content. Hippocampal hypoglycemic seizures were always followed by an irreversible reduction (> 60% loss) in synaptic transmission and were occasionally accompanied by spreading depression-like events. Hypoglycemic seizures occurred more frequently with decreasing “hypoglycemic” extracellular glucose concentrations. In contrast, no hypoglycemic seizures were generated in the neocortex during transient hypoglycemia, and the reduction of synaptic transmission was reversible (< 60% loss). Hypoglycemic seizures in the hippocampus were abolished by NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists. The anticonvulsant, midazolam, but neither phenytoin nor valproate, also abolished hypoglycemic seizures. Non-glycolytic, oxidative substrates attenuated, but did not abolish, hypoglycemic seizure activity and were unable to support synaptic transmission, even in the presence of the adenosine (A1) antagonist, DPCPX. Complete prevention of hypoglycemic seizures always led to the maintenance of synaptic transmission. A quantitative glycogen assay demonstrated that hypoglycemic seizures, in vitro, during hypoglycemia deplete hippocampal glycogen. These data suggest that suppressing seizures during hypoglycemia may decrease subsequent neuronal damage and dysfunction.
The application of high-speed TV-holography to time-resolved vibration measurements
 We describe an electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI) system that has enabled non-harmonic vibrations to be measured with μs temporal resolution. The short exposure period and high framing rate of a high-speed camera at up to 40,500 frames per second allow low-power CW laser illumination and fibre-optic beam delivery to be used, rather than the high peak power pulsed lasers normally used in ESPI for transient measurement. The technique has been demonstrated in the laboratory and tested in preliminary industrial trials. The ability to measure vibration with high spatial and temporal resolution, which is not provided by techniques such as scanning laser vibrometry, has many applications in manufacturing design, and in an illustrative application described here revealed previously unmeasured “rocking” vibrations of a car door. It has been possible to make the measurement on the door as part of a complete vehicle standing on its own tyres, wheels and suspension, and where the excitation was generated by the running of the vehicle's own engine.
Study of the hBN/InP interface by deep level transient and photoluminescence spectroscopies
 Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and photoluminescence (PL) techniques are used to study the defects occurring at the interface between hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) films and n-type Indium Phosphide (n-InP). The BN films are deposited on InP using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The measured DLTS spectra shows four discrete peaks labelled ET1, ET2, ET3 and ET4. The results are compared to those obtained on InP free surface and Metal/Insulator/Semiconductor (MIS) InP structures. The surface and interface characterization is studied by applying the PL technique to the InP(100) free surface and the Au/hBN/InP MIS structure. The minimum values of the surface and interface state density are 8 × 1010 eV− 1 cm− 2 and 1.3 × 1010 eV− 1 cm− 2 situated at 0.37 eV and 0.54 eV below the conduction band minimum, respectively. It is shown that the passivation layer reduces drastically the interface state density.
Are there any clinical and electrocardiographic predictors of heart rate reduction in relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis patients treated with fingolimod?
 Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist, is used for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). S1P receptors that fingolimod acts upon have also been shown to be expressed on atrial myocytes. This expression pattern has been linked with the drug's cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and electrocardiographic predictors of heart rate (HR) reduction in patients receiving first-dose fingolimod. We retrospectively analyzed subjects diagnosed with RRMS who were allocated to fingolimod treatment. HR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and electrocardiography during the first dose of fingolimod were accessed. A total of 114 RRMS patients (65.8% female, 33.58 ± 8.63 years) were included. After the initial dose of fingolimod, the heart rate decreased significantly at each hour (each p < 0.001). Nadir heart rate was reached at 4 h. The multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI (OR: 0.878, p = 0.045), optic nerve involvement (OR: 3.205, p = 0.018), baseline HR (OR: 1.079, p = 0.002) and T-peak-T-end interval (OR: 1.046, p = 0.030) were independent predictors of greater HR reduction. During 6-h monitorization, none of the patients had relevant adverse reactions. Our findings provide an insight on clinical and electrocardiographic predictors of HR reduction that occurs in RRMS patients receiving first dose of fingolimod.
Effect of tunicamycin on the expression of functional brain neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-operated channels in Xenopus oocytes
 The role of N-glycosylation on the expression of functional brain neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-operated channels was studied by injecting Xenopus oocytes with mRNA from rat brain or chick optic lobe, and culturing them in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine linked glycosylation. Electrophysiological recordings were then made to assess the amounts of functional receptors and channels present in the oocyte membrane. The appearance of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and voltage-activated Na+ channels was profoundly reduced. In contrast, the functional expression of kainate receptors, and voltage-activated K+ and Ca2+ channels was much less affected. Thus, it seems that kainate receptors, and K+ and Ca2+ channels can be expressed and function normally without being glycosylated. On the other hand, GABA receptors and Na+ channels may need to be N-glycosylated in order to function properly, or to ensure their correct insertion into the membrane.
A novel optical telemetry system applied to flowmeter networks
 Recently developed transducers utilise the unique characteristics of Deformed Helix Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal (DHFLC) to linearly and passively transduce small voltage signals into the optical domain. These small optical transducers can be retrofitted to an existing flowmeter network where the true benefits of distributed sensing in the optical domain can be leveraged. Signals from multiple sensors can be multiplexed into a single optical fibre for measurement at a remote location. We demonstrate two methods of signal measurement based on a positive displacement oval gear flowmeter. Utilising a reed switch to produce short pulses, errorless flow rate transduction is possible across all flow rates including very low flows. Using a variable reluctance sensor, completely passive transduction of flow rates can be achieved. The same technique can be applied to any sensing network with an electrical signal output.
Fluorescence quantum yield determination of molecules in liquids by thermally driven conical diffraction
 We report on a method to determine fluorescence quantum yield (η) of molecules in solution based on the observation of conical diffraction (CD) patterns induced by thermally driven self-phase modulation (SPM). In this approach, the central part of a laser beam is acquired as a function of its power after passing through the sample. If the thermal properties of the solvent are known, one can directly obtain η by measuring the sample optical absorption and the rings produced by CD. Otherwise, if the thermal properties of the sample are unknown, an additional measurement with the same solvent containing nonfluorescent molecules (blue-black ink, for instance) for thermal SPM generation is also needed. In this case, besides determination of η, one can also find the thermal conductivity (K) of the unknown solvent provided that the thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) is independently measured. K values obtained with this approach are in good agreement with the literature. CD technique was applied in rhodamine 6 G and a chromophore derivative of vitamin B6 in different solvents. Therefore, the present method may serve as a low-cost optical approach for η determination in liquid samples and for K measurements in unknown solutions.
Measurement of the 100 MHz EMF radiation in vivo effects on zebrafish D. rerio embryonic development: A multidisciplinary study
 The augmented exposure of both environment and human being to electromagnetic waves and the concomitant lack of an unequivocal knowledge about biological consequences of these radiations, raised public interest on electromagnetic pollution. In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the biological effects on zebrafish (ZF) embryos of 100 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure through a multidisciplinary protocol. Because of the shared synteny between human and ZF genomes that validated its use in biomedical research, toxicology and developmental biology studies, ZF was here selected as experimental model and a measurement protocol and biological analyses have been set up to clearly discriminate between RF-EMF biological and thermal effects. The results showed that a 100 MHz EMF was able to affect ZF embryonic development, from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) in all the analyzed pathways. Particularly, at the 48 hpf stage, a reduced growth, an increased transcription of oxidative stress genes, the onset of apoptotic/autophagic processes and a modification in cholesterol metabolism were detected. ZF embryos faced stress induced by EMF radiation by triggering detoxification mechanisms and at 72 hpf they partially recovered from stress reaching the hatching time in a comparable way respect to the control group. Data here obtained showed unequivocally the in vivo effects of RF-EMF on an animal model, excluding thermal outcomes and thus represents the starting point for more comprehensive studies on dose response effects of electromagnetic fields radiations consequences.
A light-emitting diode light source for imaging of neural activities with voltage-sensitive dyes
 We tested the possibility of using a high-power monochromatic InGaN light-emitting diode (LED) as an excitation light source for real-time optical imaging using the voltage-sensitive dye RH-795. Driven with a custom-designed, non-feedback-controlled constant-current circuit, the LED generated stable light with rapid on/off. The LED was comparable with commonly used halogen lamps in exciting RH-795. Acoustically evoked responses in the auditory cortex recorded with the two light sources were highly similar. Our results thus suggest that a high-power LED can be successfully used as an excitation light source for voltage-sensitive dyes, without the need of optical filters and shutters.
Recent catalysis measurements at IRS
 At the Institute of Space Systems (IRS), experiments have been performed using the high enthalpy, inductively heated plasma generator (IPG) in plasma wind tunnel 3 (PWK3), in order to assess the catalytic behaviour of different materials. Utilising the Upwind Relaxation Algorithm for Non-equilibrium Flows of the University of Stuttgart (URANUS), a methodology for determining catalytic efficiencies by obtaining atomic recombination probabilities γ for high temperature materials, has been developed. This method eliminates the inherent uncertainties produced when using catalytic properties of previously tested materials to infer those of new materials. In this work, eight different candidates for the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of an entry vehicle have been studied, of which six are ceramic materials and the other two are metallic alloys. Thermochemical properties of these specimens are given for surface temperatures between 1000 and 2000 K in pure oxygen and pure nitrogen plasmas. The high enthalpies and relatively low pressure conditions in which these material samples have been tested in PWK3 are relevant for entry applications from Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Spark discharge ignition process in a spark-ignition engine using a time series of spectra measurements
 The spark discharge ignition process was investigated using simultaneous temperature measurements of the spark discharges and the initial flame kernel. We were able for the first time to measure a time series of emission spectra from the spark discharge and initial flame kernel inside a spark-ignition engine using a spectrometer coupled with a spark plug and optical fiber. The plasma vibrational temperature of the spark discharge can be measured using time series emission spectra from the electrically excited CN* violet band system. The gas rotational temperature of the initial flame kernel can also be measured using emission spectra from OH* radicals (P and R branches). Simultaneously, visualization of the spark discharge and a time series of emission spectra inside a spark-ignition engine were performed under homogeneous mixture conditions, to eliminate the effects of stratification of temperature and mixture concentrations around the spark plug. We discuss thermal energy transfer from the spark discharge to the combustible mixture. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows. CN* emission can be detected from the spark discharge, visualized using a high-speed camera during the arc discharge phase. Our results confirmed that the plasma temperature of the spark discharge was nearly 6800 K and that thermal energy was transferred from the spark plasma channel to the combustible mixture. The gas temperature of the initial flame kernel approached that of the adiabatic flame temperature.
Effect of calcination temperature on performance of ZnO nanoparticles for dye-sensitized solar cells
 The photovoltaic performances of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were studied using ZnO nanoparticles prepared via the sol–gel method in gelatin medium at different calcination temperatures. The effects of the calcination temperature on the size, surface area, photoluminescence properties, and dye adsorption ability of ZnO nanoparticles were investigated. The results showed that the size of the nanoparticles increased and the surface area decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature. In addition, the oxygen vacancies of the nanoparticles increased with an increase in the calcination temperature. Moreover, although the surface area of the nanoparticles prepared at 600 °C was lower than that of those prepared at 500 °C, their dye adsorption abilities were the same, and both were higher than that of those prepared at 700 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay measurements were carried out to investigate the cell functions. The DSSC based on ZnO nanoparticles calcined at 600 °C exhibited the highest conversion efficiency because of its higher dye adsorption ability and lower recombination rate compared to the others.
Optimal capacitor placement by Enhanced Bacterial Foraging Optimization (EBFO) with accurate thermal re-rating of critical cables
 Optimal capacitor placement can significantly aid the control of the steady-state performance of a power system. During both normal and contingency operation in an existing network operating with future loading scenarios, some power lines have overloading and some buses have violations in their voltages. Optimal capacitor has the ability to solve these problems by controlling the voltage profile and then affecting on the power flows. In the simulated network, there are some cases where optimal placement on its own cannot sufficiently reduce power flows in some underground cables, even though it does dramatically reduce the degree of overloading. Enhanced Bacterial Foraging Optimization (EBFO) is incorporated optimally criteria for capacitors placement with sizing. That to enhance the performance of the power network in normal operation and during contingencies involving transmission line outages. The lines that are still overloaded are then evaluated with a comprehensive transient cable rating algorithm developed to see whether an accurate thermal re-assessment of the cable installations and loading will yield higher allowable load flows compared to the original ratings, which were based on conventional steady-stage rating techniques. The paper thus integrates the optimal capacitor placement and sizing with an accurate thermal evaluation of the cables that exceed their steady-state thermal limit to achieve a complete solution of all the system problems. This integrated approach is proposed for an actual realworld 110 kV sub-transmission network.
Time resolved detection of electrochemical effects by surface plasmon resonance measurements: a simple technique using a large area single cell photodiode
 This work discusses a relatively simple method for time resolved detection of electrochemical effects using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) under potentiodynamic conditions. A previously noted phenomenological framework for measuring SPR shifts at a fixed angle is quantified and developed in detail. The SPR experiments are performed with a collimated laser beam at a fixed wavelength using the Kretschmann configuration. The instrument uses a commonly available fast photodiode for signal detection, and has an angular resolution of 10−3 deg. As a model electrochemical system, we use a chromium-supported gold film, controlled by cyclic voltammetry in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.1 M NaNO3. The transient SPR response of the electrode to voltage variations contains features of certain interfacial effects that cannot be detected using electrochemical measurements alone. This SPR technique is suitable for studying both faradaic and nonfardaic reactions.
Baseline characteristics of the transient pattern electroretinogram in non-human primates: inter-ocular and inter-session variability
 This study assessed the inter-ocular and inter-session variability of the transient pattern electroretinogram (PERG) in a group of non-human primates. The transient PERG was measured both eyes of 29 non-human primates, and again after three months in 23 eyes of 23 of these animals. Signals were elicited using a contrast (90%, 75 cd m−2) reversing (5 reversals sec−1) checkerboard pattern (0·56 cpd). PERGs were also measured for stimuli of varied spatial frequency (n=8, 0·07–2·22 cpd), contrast (n=4, 20–100%), mean luminance (n=4, 4·7–75 cd m−2) and defocus (n=5, +1, +2, +3 diopters). The inter-eye and inter-session limits-of-agreement (LOA; 95%) were determined for each PERG parameter. Variability was also compared with previous studies using the coefficient-of-variability (COV). Pharmacological blockade of the inner retinal contributions to the PERG measured under these conditions was conducted in one animal using intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin (∼6 μM) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (∼6 μM). The N95 component of the primate transient PERG showed spatial tuning, with a peak between 0·14 and 0·28 cpd. This spatial tuning was not as apparent for the P50 component. A linear relationship between P50 and N95 amplitude was found with contrast and mean luminance. Both components were attenuated with the introduction of +2 diopters or more of defocus. The inter-session COV for the P50 and N95 components were 23·8 and 19·2%, respectively, while the LOA were 58 and 46%, respectively. The N95:P50 ratio had smaller inter-session variability, was robust to changes in contrast, mean luminance and defocus, and was effective for characterization of inner-retinal dysfunction after pharmacologic block.
Temperature measurement
 This chapter discusses how temperature measurement is very important in all spheres of life, especially in the process industries. Thermocouples are delicate devices that must be treated carefully if their specified operating characteristics are to be maintained. Thermocouples are manufactured by connecting together two wires of different materials, where each material is produced so as to conform precisely with some defined composition specification. Semiconductor devices, consisting of either diodes or integrated circuit transistors, have only been commonly used in industrial applications for a few years, but they were first invented several decades ago. Thermal expansion methods make use of the fact that the dimensions of all substances—whether solids, liquids, or gases—change with temperature. The quartz thermometer makes use of the principle that the resonant frequency of a material such as quartz is a function of temperature, and thus enables temperature changes to be translated into frequency changes. Fiber-optic cables can be used as either intrinsic or extrinsic temperature sensors. The color of various substances and objects changes as a function of temperature. Temperature-indicating devices known as Seger cones or pyrometric cones are commonly used in the ceramics industry. Intelligent temperature transmitters have now been introduced into the catalogs of most instrument manufacturers, and they bring about the usual benefits associated with intelligent instruments. The suitability of different instruments in any particular measurement situation depends substantially on whether the medium to be measured is a solid or a fluid.
The structural and electrical characterization of Al/GO-SiO2/p-Si photodiode
 GO-SiO2 composite structures were synthesized chemically and characterized by FTIR, XRD, TGA and SEM. The characterization results highlighted that the composite of the GO-SiO2 was obtained successfully and can be thought as interfacial layer between the metal and semiconductor. For that reason, the GO-SiO2 composites were inserted between Al metal and p-type Si semiconductor by spin coating technique, and Al/GO-SiO2/p-type Si device was obtained by aid of thermal evaporation. The obtained device was tested with I-V measurements for various illumination conditions. Ideality factor, barrier height and series resistance values were determined according to thermionic emission theory, Cheung and Norde functions. In addition, we studied transient photocurrent properties of the device. The results confirm that the device can be used as photodiode in the industrial applications as having good photostability and photoresponsivity.
High sensitivity data acquisition during strong transient electromagnetic fields
 The 225 kJ 60 kV single-turn coil equipment that recently went into full operation in Berlin, makes it possible to work with magnetic fields above 200 T in a volume of about 1 cm3. The generation of such high magnetic fields take place on a μs-time scale and is therefore connected with very strong transient electromagnetic pulses, which considerably complicate the measuring procedure. This paper describes the techniques used to record data while taking optical measurements in the infrared range.
Autoimmunity in visual loss
 There are a number of autoimmune disorders which can affect visual function. There are a very large number of mechanisms in the visual pathway which could potentially be the targets of autoimmune attack. In practice it is the retina and the anterior visual pathway (optic nerve and chiasm) that are recognised as being affected in autoimmune disorders. Multiple Sclerosis is one of the commonest causes of visual loss in young adults because of the frequency of attacks of optic neuritis in that condition, however the basis of the inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis and the confirmation of autoimmunity is lacking. The immune process is known to be highly unusual in that it is not systemic and confined to the CNS compartment. Previously an enigmatic partner to Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica is now established to be autoimmune and two antibodies – to Aquaporin4 and to Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein – have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The term Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy is applied to those cases of optic neuritis which require long term immunosuppression and hence are presumed to be autoimmune but where no autoimmune pathogenesis has been confirmed. Optic neuritis occurring post-infection and post vaccination and conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and various vasculitides may cause direct autoimmune attack to visual structures or indirect damage through occlusive vasculopathy. Chronic granulomatous disorders such as Sarcoidosis affect vision commonly by a variety of mechanisms, whether and how these are placed in the autoimmune panoply is unknown. As far as the retina is concerned Cancer Associated Retinopathy and Melanoma Associated Retinopathy are well characterised clinically but a candidate autoantibody (recoverin) is only described in the former disorder. Other, usually monophasic, focal retinal inflammatory disorders (Idiopathic Big Blind Spot Syndrome, Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy and Acute Macular Neuroretinitis) are of obscure pathogenesis but an autoimmune disorder of the post-infectious type is plausible. Visual loss in autoimmunity is an expanding field: the most significant advances in research have resulted from taking a well characterised phenotype and making educated guesses at the possible molecular targets of autoimmune attack.
Optical detection of brain activity using plasmonic ellipsometry technique
 In spite of the existence of many techniques in the field of neural signal recording and mapping, the realm for emergence of novel methods is still open. One of the novel methods that attracts the researchers’ attention is neuroplasmonics which benefits from the voltage-sensitive plasmonics. However, this field faces two main ambiguities: the physical mechanism of voltage-sensitive sensing of plasmonics and second, the strength of recorded responses. In this paper, after replying briefly the first question, we go forward by proposing ellipsometry measurements as a strong and very sensitive characterization method for voltage-sensitive plasmonics. Here, the suggested parameter of effective delta (i.e. delta contrast) creates the opportunity to distinguish clearly the results of applying different voltages to biological solutions (i.e. Phosphate Buffer Solution and artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid) and brain tissue (i.e. cerebellum tissue). The strong response of effective delta for cerebellum tissue indicates that the stimulation of brain tissue via external potential redistributes the charges at the interface of metal and modulates its dielectric constant at Thomson-Fermi layer which subsequently, leads to the variation in surface plasmon resonance signal.
Fiber Optic Link Requirements
 This chapter illustrates the performance requirements of a fiber link and presents some design trade-offs involved in link planning and implementation. It emphasizes on the performance of point-to-point data links. These data links are the most common building blocks of data communication networks. These are used to build up more complex logical topologies, such as switched stars, rings, and so forth. The performance of a network system depends on the interaction of many elements, including both hardware and software, and is largely application dependent. Most data links are full duplex, thus permitting a two-way communication among the attached devices. Data link design is driven by the cost of optoelectronic transceivers and adapters, and not by optimization of the fiber bandwidth. Another unique requirement of datacom systems is distance. Fiber optic links are capable of error-free transmission over tens of km at data rates significantly higher than those of copper systems, which were earlier used. This increase in the data rate-distance product has opened up the data center and is partly responsible for recent distributed computing strategies. It has also enabled new applications, such as real-time data backup at a remote location for emergency disaster recovery.
9. Acousto-Optic Phenomena
 This chapter describes the different aspects of acousto-optic phenomena. The theory of the acousto-optic interaction involving bulk and surface acoustic waves is well known. There are two light scattering mechanisms in the bulk of a material—namely, the elasto-optic and electro-optic effects. At a material surface, an acoustically produced surface corrugation also scatters light. The elasto-optic effect is the primary scattering mechanism in most acousto-optic interactions. This phenomenon has a simple origin in a liquid and arises from the spatial, and temporal modulation of the dielectric constant by the density fluctuations associated with a longitudinal sound wave. The relation between the modulated dielectric constant and the acoustic fields is of a tensorial nature in a solid, and scattering can take place from both shear and longitudinal waves. The corrugation effect is important when the incident light is reflected from or transmitted through an interface corrugated by the presence of surface or bulk waves. The two common interaction geometries for the scattering of light by surface acoustic waves are also elaborated.
Electro-optic detection of colloid flocculation
 An apparatus is described which is sensitive to the detection of flocculation within colloidal slurries. The system records transient changes in the optical scattering when colloidal suspensions are subjected to pulsed electric fields. The apparatus is particularly relevant to non-spherical particles and is applicable to both dilute and concentrated media. It has potential as an 'on-line' monitoring mechanism for dosage control of flocculating or deflocculating reagents.
Measurements of brake disc surface temperature and emissivity by two-color pyrometry
 A fiber optic two-color pyrometer was developed for brake disc surface temperature and emissivity measurements. The two-color pyrometer consists of a fluoride glass optical fiber, two HgCdTe detectors equipped with bandwidth filters and a data conditioning and acquisition device. The two-color pyrometer measures the brake disc temperature in the 200–800 °C range with a time resolution of 8 μs. The calibration formula for the signals obtained using a blackbody of known temperature is used to compute the true temperature. The uncertainty estimation for temperature and emissivity was obtained from the calibration results. Tests were carried out on known temperature target and a good correlation was found between results obtained with our two-color pyrometer and those obtained with a commercial two-color pyrometer. Hold braking and deceleration braking tests performed on a braking test bench enabled us to reach the brake disc surface temperature and emissivity during braking. Experimental results show a significant variation of emissivity during braking. Direct measurement of emissivity was carried out on the brake disc after braking and shows the emissivity dependence with the surface quality.
The role of high-injection effects on the transient ion beam induced current response of high-speed photodetectors
 High-speed photodetectors are the primary cause of increasing bit error rates (BER) in optic fiber communication system used in radiation hard environments such as space. MeV heavy ions passing through the collection volume of a photodetector generate a single event transient which upon passing to the decoding electronics causes spurious noise (increasing the BER). The time-resolved (or transient) ion beam induced current response of a photodetector is largely influenced by high-injection effects such as space-charge screening that perturb the electric-field distribution leading to drastic alterations in carrier velocity distributions, local mobilities and charge collection characteristics. Here, we examine the transient response of a Si p–i–n photodetector irradiated with 15 MeV O and 11 MeV C ions and discuss the role of high-injection effects with the aid of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) software. Ambipolar diffusion was found (experimentally and theoretically) to dominate charge transport for high-injection levels present for most heavy ions. Light ions also experience similar conditions, but over a much shorter period.
Effects of step changes in excitation from a steady state on the transient electric field and space charge behavior for unipolar ion conduction
 The previous analysis of the transient electric field and space charge behavior for drift-dominated unipolar ion conduction is continued and extended by considering steady-state systems for which the terminal voltage is instantaneously increased or decreased including short-circuit conditions. Representative boundary conditions considered are a field-threshold condition whereby charge injection occurs whenever the emitter electric field reaches a critical value and the case where the injected charge density is proportional to the emitter electric field. For a step change in voltage, the electric field also changes everywhere by a constant so that its average value remains proportional to the voltage, although the spatial derivative which is proportional to the charge density is continuous. With a field-threshold condition for charge injection, a step increase in voltage results in spontaneous charge injection to keep the emitter electric field constant, while step decreases in voltage result in no charge injection until the emitter field reaches the critical value. For small voltages the critical field is never reached, resulting in no further charge injection, so the analysis reduces to a pure initial-value problem as the system approaches the uniform electric field of an ideal capacitor. For step-down voltages, the emitter electric field could become negative reversing the direction of motion of the charges. Detailed plots of the electric field and space charge distributions for representative voltage steps and charge injection boundary conditions are presented.
Microprocessor based recognition of dot-matrix characters using a fibre-optic scanner
 This paper presents a new, but simple device to recognize computer-printed dot-matrix character patterns. The device uses a fibre-optic scanner for feature extraction and is controlled by an 8-bit 8085 microprocessor. Details of design, fabrication and recognition techniques are presented. The device was used to recognize all the keyboard characters/symbol patterns of an IBM Personal Computer.
Comparison of nondestructive microfailure evaluation of fiber-optic Bragg grating and acoustic emission piezoelectric sensors using fragmentation test
 Nondestructive evaluation of microfailure mechanisms in two-diameter SiC fibers/epoxy composites is investigated using a directly embedded fiber-optic sensor attached with an acoustic emission piezoelectric (AE-PZT) sensor. Interfacial shear strength by fragmentation test, and optical failure observation inside microcomposite can contribute to analyze two sensors quantitatively. Although fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor exhibits sudden wavelength shift due to plastic deformation by larger diameter SiC fiber breakage, AE-PZT monitors much more precise microfailure process, such as the fiber break or matrix cracking. Since the FBG sensor can measure the strain at only a single point, whether it can detect a fiber break in single-fiber composite specimen depends on its proximity to the failure location. In addition, micro-strain measurement at one single point may not provide enough information on the whole microfailure process including multiple fiber breakage and matrix crack. It can be considered that FBG sensor can be somewhat effective in measuring the continuous micro-strain change due to the internal disturbance such as resin curing, whereas AE-PZT sensor can be effective in detecting the microfailure by elastic wave propagation through the composite materials.
Autoimmune T cells retard the loss of function in injured rat optic nerves
 We recently demonstrated that autoimmune T cells protect neurons from secondary degeneration after central nervous system (CNS) axotomy in rats. Here we show, using both morphological and electrophysiological analyses, that the neuroprotection is long-lasting and is manifested functionally. After partial crush injury of the rat optic nerve, systemic injection of autoimmune T cells specific to myelin basic protein significantly diminished the loss of retinal ganglion cells and conducting axons, and significantly retarded the loss of the visual response evoked by light stimulation. These results support our challenge to the traditional concept of autoimmunity as always harmful, and suggest that in certain situations T cell autoimmunity may actually be beneficial. It might be possible to employ T cell intervention to slow down functional loss in the injured CNS.
Electro-optic properties of InGaAs/InP multi-quantum well PIN structures
 Electrical and optical properties of InGaAs/InP multi-quantum well (MQW) PIN diodes with a 0.5 μm thick InP undoped spacer layer exhibiting low reverse bias leakage current and uniform avalanche multiplication gain of 10 near the breakdown voltage have been investigated. We have found that the speed of the time response to optical pulses for the reverse voltage between -10 and -40 V contains both fast and slow component. The C-V characteristics obtained under different illumination levels showed an anomalous increase of the capacitance for the reverse voltages higher than the punch-through. These properties are different from those of InGaAs/InP PIN or SAM photodiodes that do not have the MQW region.
Optical detection of neuron connectivity by random access two-photon microscopy
 Knowledge about the distribution, strength, and direction of synaptic connections within neuronal networks are crucial for understanding brain function. Electrophysiology using multiple electrodes provides a very high temporal resolution, but does not yield sufficient spatial information for resolving neuronal connection topology. Optical recording techniques using single-cell resolution have provided promise for providing spatial information. Although calcium imaging from hundreds of neurons has provided a novel view of the neural connections within the network, the kinetics of calcium responses are not fast enough to resolve each action potential event with high fidelity. Therefore, it is not possible to detect the direction of neuronal connections. We took advantage of the fast kinetics and large dynamic range of the DiO/DPA combination of voltage sensitive dye and the fast scan speed of a custom-made random-access two-photon microscope to resolve each action potential event from multiple neurons in culture. Long-duration recording up to 100 min from cultured hippocampal neurons yielded sufficient numbers of spike events for analyzing synaptic connections. Cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs clearly distinguished synaptically connected neuron pairs with the connection direction. The long duration recording of action potentials with voltage-sensitive dye utilized in the present study is much longer than in previous studies. Simultaneous optical voltage and calcium measurements revealed that voltage-sensitive dye is able to detect firing events more reliably than calcium indicators. This novel method reveals a new view of the functional structure of neuronal networks.
High-speed, random-access fluorescence microscopy: I. High-resolution optical recording with voltage-sensitive dyes and ion indicators
 The design and implementation of a high-speed, random-access, laser-scanning fluorescence microscope configured to record fast physiological signals from small neuronal structures with high spatiotemporal resolution is presented. The laser-scanning capability of this nonimaging microscope is provided by two orthogonal acousto-optic deflectors under computer control. Each scanning point can be randomly accessed and has a positioning time of 3–5 microseconds. Sampling time is also computer-controlled and can be varied to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Acquisition rates up to 200k samples/s at 16-bit digitizing resolution are possible. The spatial resolution of this instrument is determined by the minimal spot size at the level of the preparation (i.e., 2–7 microns). Scanning points are selected interactively from a reference image collected with differential interference contrast optics and a video camera. Frame rates up to 5 kHz are easily attainable. Intrinsic variations in laser light intensity and scanning spot brightness are overcome by an on-line signal-processing scheme. Representative records obtained with this instrument by using voltage-sensitive dyes and calcium indicators demonstrate the ability to make fast, high-fidelity measurements of membrane potential and intracellular calcium at high spatial resolution (2 microns) without any temporal averaging.

Four-pulse interferometric recordings of transient events by pulsed TV holography
 With traditional double-pulsed holographic interferometry or pulsed TV holography, the experiment usually has to be repeated to allow the recording of a time sequence of interferograms of the event. With the proposed technique a sequence of four interferograms of a solitary transient event is measured. A twin oscillator, injection-seeded, pulsed Nd:YAG laser is incorporated into a pulsed TV holography set-up. With orthogonal polarisation and double pulsing of each of the two channels of the laser, four pulses are recorded on two separate CCD-frames. Four interferograms of a laser-impacted plate obtained from the same experiment, show how the bending waves develop and propagate in the plate.
Norepinephrine modulates excitability of neonatal rat optic nerves through calcium-mediated mechanisms
 We report that norepinephrine markedly increases excitability of neonatal rat optic nerves. To investigate the mechanisms of the norepinephrine-induced excitability increase, we studied isolated optic nerves from 42 neonatal (< three days old) and five adult (> three months old) Long-Evan's hooded rats. Norepinephrine (10−6, 10−5 and 10−4 M) rapidly and reversibly increased the amplitudes (mean ± S.D.: 3.5 ± 1.7%, 12.1 ± 2.8% and 35.6 ± 8.4%) of compound action potentials elicited by submaximal stimulation of neonatal optic nerves. The beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10−5 M) blocked the norepinephrine-induced increase in excitability but the alpha antagonist phentolamine (10−5 M) did not. The beta agonist isoproterenol (10−5 and 10−4 M) increased response amplitudes (8.7 ± 4.1% and 25.8 ± 4.6%) but the alpha-1 agonist and methoxamine and alpha-2 agonist clonidine did not. The beta antagonist propranolol blocked the isoproterenol effect. Replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+ or adding 0.8 mM of Cd2+ reversibly blocked the norepinephrine effects. Extracellular K+ concentrations did not change in optic nerves during norepinephrine application. Blockade of K+ channels with apamin (10−6 M) or tetraethylammonium (10−3 M) did not prevent the excitatory effects of norepinephrine. Adult rat optic nerves were insensitive to both norepinephrine (10−4 M) and isoproterenol (10−4 M). Our results indicate that norepinephrine increases neonatal optic axonal excitability through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. The data suggest that the adrenoceptors are situated on the axons, that the excitability changes are not due to changes in extracellular K+ concentration or K+ channels sensitive to apamin or tetraethylammonium. The sensitivity of rat optic nerves to norepinephrine declined with age. Axonal adrenoceptors may play a role in optic axonal development and injury.
Delay-independent excitation control for uncertain large power systems using wide-area measurement signals
 Technological advance of wide-area measurement systems (WAMS) has enabled the use of a combination of measured information from remote location for transient stability enhancement. However, there exist time delays when remote signals are transported in WAMS. Moreover, the time delays are multiple and uncertain, and depend on the distance, protocol of transmission and several other factors. In order to improve the transient stability of wide-area power system, taking into account the impacts of the time delays and the uncertainties introduced by nonlinearity in system model, a delay-independent decentralized coordinated robust approach is proposed to design excitation controller in terms of H∞ optimization method incorporating linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique based on T-S fuzzy model by using wide-area signals. Simulation demonstrates that the four-machine large system under the robust excitation controller has better transient stability performance in the face of various transmission time delays, severe variations of operating point and faults in various locations.
Characterizing Voltage-Dependent Conformational Changes in the ShakerK+ Channel with Fluorescence
 We examined voltage-dependent conformational changes in three specific regions of the Shaker potassium channel with site-directed fluorescent labeling: the fourth transmembrane segment (S4), the second transmembrane segment (S2), and the putative pore region. The fluorescence changes displayed distinctive properties that correlate with gating, activation, and slow inactivation of the channel. The fluorescence signals measured near the S2 and S4 segments suggest that the S2 segment may undergo voltage-sensitive conformational changes that precede those in the S4 segment. In contrast, fluorescence changes in the pore correlated with the voltage dependence and time course of ionic activation and slow inactivation. Spectroscopy indicated that the mechanism of fluorescence change involves voltage-dependent quenching of the probe in an aqueous environment by other parts of the protein.
Evaluating multiple reliability indices of regional networks in wide area measurement system
 The paper presents a hierarchical structure of Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) that can satisfy requirements of reliable real-time data transfer. The methods of calculating multiple reliability indices of WAMS regional networks in the protection and recovery survival mechanisms are developed and an equivalent two-state model of a WAMS regional network is presented. The numerical results of an example indicate that the meshed WAMS regional network can provide a very high reliability level. The reliability of the regional network can be enhanced by selecting an appropriate location of Phasor Data Center (PDC) or by improving availability of crucial optic fiber links in the protection mechanism. In the dynamic recovery mechanism, however, these measures may not be effective and thus the key consideration should be put on how to timely restore data transfers after a communication contingency.
The Future of Imaging in Detecting Glaucoma Progression
 Ocular imaging has been heavily incorporated into glaucoma management and provides important information that aids in the detection of disease progression. Longitudinal studies have shown that the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer is an important parameter for glaucoma progression detection, whereas other studies have demonstrated that macular parameters, such as the ganglion cell inner plexiform layer and optic nerve head parameters, also are useful for progression detection. The introduction of novel technologies with faster scan speeds, wider scanning fields, higher resolution, and improved tissue penetration has enabled the precise quantification of additional key ocular structures, such as the individual retinal layers, optic nerve head, choroid, and lamina cribrosa. Furthermore, extracting functional information from scans such as blood flow rate and oxygen consumption provides new perspectives on the disease and its progression. These novel methods promise improved detection of glaucoma progression and better insight into the mechanisms of progression that will lead to better targeted treatment options to prevent visual damage and blindness.
An electro-optic laser probe at low temperature for the characterization of planar integrated microwave resonators
 An electro-optic crystal probe has been used to measure noninvasively the strength of the electric stray field of coplanar λ/2-resonators at about 6GHz. Resonators have been structured from a single layer of the high temperature superconductor Y Ba2Cu3O7-x as well as from copper. The spatial electric field distribution along the resonator lines shows the expected functional behavior. Field mapping however, requires that the vertical probe position is maintained with great accuracy. From the measurements of the field strength versus frequency the resonator quality factors can be determined. Good agreement with measurements carried out with a microwave network analyzer has been found.
A novel noninvasive videographic method for quantifying changes in the chromaticity of the optic nerve head with changes in the intraocular pressure, pulsatile choroidal blood flow and visual neural function in humans
 Vision loss in glaucoma may be due to the compressive effects of the intraocular pressure (IOP) on the ganglion cell axons, impaired blood flow to the optic nerve, or some combination of these two factors. While reducing the IOP may preserve vision in patients with elevated IOP, not all patients experience longterm benefits from this therapeutic approach. The survival of ganglion cells may be more dependent upon the degree of vascular perfusion of the optic nerve head (ONH). In this report we present some preliminary data on a new noninvasive videographic technique for elaborating the capacity of the ONH vasculature to maintain perfusion constancy in the presence of transient elevations of the IOP and reductions of the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). Shortterm, stepwise reductions of the OPP in the test eye of visually normal subjects (n = 5) systematically altered both the chromaticity (hue, saturation, brightness) of the ONH and the pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) in the choroid. Similar transient reductions in the OPP were seen to impair normal retinal physiology, as indicated by a significant attenuation of the bilateral pattern-reversal electroretinograms (pERGs) in visually normal subjects (n = 7). This technique was also used to reveal spontaneous rhythmical variations in the ONH chromaticity which were linked to the cardiac pulse rate. This so-called “chromatic pulse” of the ONH offers potential as a useful clinical index for evaluating the vascular perfusion of the ONH. The diagnostic and prognostic potential of dynamic digital imaging for the detection of abnormal hemodynamics in the ONH is discussed.
Continuous-wave cavity ring-down evanescent-field sensing with a broadband source based on frequency-shifted interferometry
 We demonstrate that all-fiber cavity ring-down (CRD) evanescent-field sensing can be performed using frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI). In contrast to conventional CRD schemes, without the need for any optical pulse or fast electronics, this FSI–CRD technique allows one to monitor the intensity decay of a continuous lightwave traveling inside a fiber loop ring-down cavity (RDC), from which the cavity loss information can be deduced. By incorporating a fiber taper as the sensing element inside a RDC, we carried out FSI–CRD experiments with an amplified spontaneous emission source, an acousto-optic modulator, and a slow detector, successfully applying the technique to the measurement of chemical solution concentration based on absorption, solution refractive index change, or a combination of both. A minimum detectable 1-octyne concentration of 0.29% (or 0.020 M) was achieved in decane, while refractive index sensitivity of 1 dB/RIU with a measurement error of 1 × 10−4 dB was attained in sodium chloride solutions (NaCl in water). The 1-octyne detection limit is better than previously reported values measured by conventional fiber-based CRD techniques.
Electrical measurement and instrumentation — Today and tomorrow
 This review paper deals with the present status of electrical measurement and instrumentation and is concerned with the trends in this rapidly developing field. However, it is impossible to discuss in detail all development trends in electrical measurement and instrumentation. Thus, the paper concentrates on such characteristic trends as the increase of accuracy and stability of reference sources, application of digital instrumentation, microelectronics, computers and measurement systems. The influence of electromagnetic compatibility, electromagnetic interference and susceptibility will be discussed. The paper also briefly deals with the development of sensors and transducers. Finally a general remark is made on the application of more and more sophisticated measuring instrument and systems.
Wide bandwidth phase-locked diode laser with an intra-cavity electro-optic modulator
 Two extended cavity laser diodes are phase-locked, thanks to an intra-cavity electro-optical modulator. The phase-locked loop bandwidth is on the order of 10 MHz, which is about twice larger than when the feedback correction is applied on the laser current. The phase noise reaches −120 dBrad2/Hz at 10 kHz. This new scheme reduces the residual laser phase noise, which constitutes one of the dominant contributions in the sensitivity limit of atom interferometers using two-photon transitions.
The use of transient electric birefringence to characterize the conformation of DNA in solution, the mechanism of DNA gel electrophoresis, and the structure of agarose gels
 Two small, 153 base-pair (bp) DNA restriction fragments, one of which migrates anomalously slowly during electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, have been characterized by transient electric birefringence (TEB). The decay of the birefringence of the anomalously slowly migrating fragment is faster than that of the normal fragment under a variety of buffer conditions, suggesting that the anomalous fragment is stably bent or curved in free solution. Reversing field experiments suggest that both the anomalous and normal DNA fragments orient in the electric field by a slow induced dipole mechanism. Birefringence relaxation times have also been measured for three DNA molecules embedded in agarose gels of various concentrations. The embedded DNA molecules become oriented in the electric field, just as in free solution. If the median pore diameter of the gel is approximately twice as large as the apparent end-to-end length of the DNA in solution, the relaxation times of the embedded DNA molecules are unaffected by the presence of the gel, indicating that the DNA retains its usual wormlike coil conformation in the gel matrix. However, as the end-to-end length of the DNA approaches the median pore diameter of the gel, the DNA molecules become stretched out and elongated in the electric field, leading to a repetitive, or end-on, mode of migration during electrophoresis. The relaxation times of the stretched DNA molecules scale as the 2.8 power of molecular weight, in reasonable agreement with reptation theories. The structure of agarose gels has also been characterized by TEB. The long, low voltage electric fields used for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) cause extensive orientation of the agarose gel fibers. A wide range of relaxation times is observed after the field is removed, corresponding to the orientation of gel fibers up to 22 μm in length. The sign of the birefringence is variable, indicating that the gel fibers can be oriented in different directions in different parts of the gel. Surprisingly, the sign of the birefringence reverses upon field reversal, suggesting that the gel fibers change their direction of orientation in reversing electric fields. This anomalous orientation behavior is not observed for chemically crosslinked polyacrylamide gels. The apparent orientation and reorientation of agarose gel fibers in rapidly reversing electric fields may lead to ‘dynamic pores’ in the gel matrix, facilitating the migration of very large DNA molecules during PFGE.
Application of an acousto-optic spectrometer for plasma etching process quality control
 The solution is proposed to the problem of the relative concentration dynamics control of chemically active particles in the low temperature gas plasma as well as the investigation of their generation and annihilation by means of time-resolved actinometry. A special small-size acousto-optic spectrometer has been constructed capable of spectral resolution of 0.1–0.3 nm in the visible range (430–850 nm) and the maximum time resolution of 2.0 μs. The software package developed allows: 1.(1) measuring of the chronograms of the relative concentrations of various active particles in parallel mode at eight spectral channels;2.(2) generating impulse plasma modulation and measuring the microdynamics of the generation and annihilation of the active particles in the frame-by-frame mode (1024 points) in four parallel spectral channels, including the two corresponding background values. To shorten the measurement time and to improve the measurement accuracy of the particle annihilation kinetic characteristics in the interval between two stationary (long) pulses, it is proposed to form a series of probing (short) pulses. (1) measuring of the chronograms of the relative concentrations of various active particles in parallel mode at eight spectral channels; (2) generating impulse plasma modulation and measuring the microdynamics of the generation and annihilation of the active particles in the frame-by-frame mode (1024 points) in four parallel spectral channels, including the two corresponding background values. To shorten the measurement time and to improve the measurement accuracy of the particle annihilation kinetic characteristics in the interval between two stationary (long) pulses, it is proposed to form a series of probing (short) pulses. Some preliminary results are presented of the monitoring of the fluorine radicals (703.7 nm) relative concentration in the SF6 gas r.f. plasma, containing as an actinometer a small amount (up to 5%) or argon (750.4 nm) at different discharge powers. Using the measurement results of the fluorine radicals, relative concentration in the pulse-modulated noble gas plasma obtained at monosilicon etching, the constants of the radical accumulation, as well as their life time values, are determined for the loaded and unloaded reaction chamber.
Transparent metal oxide films based sensors for solar tracking applications
 Titanium dioxide:zinc oxide (TiO2:ZnO) composite thin films were prepared onto glass and p-type silicon substrates by the sol–gel spin coating technique. The composite metal oxide films indicate a high transmittance more than 90% in visible region. Optical constants such as optical band gap and refractive index of the films were determined using transmittance and reflectance spectra. TiO2:ZnO/p-Si diodes exhibited a high photocurrent responsivity under various solar illuminations. Electronic parameters like ideality factor, series resistance and barrier height were determined from I–V characteristic curves, Cheung model and Norde equations. The capacitance–voltage and conductance–voltage of the diodes were measured in the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The capacitance of the diodes exhibited a decrease in capacitance and increase in conductance with increasing frequency. The obtained results suggest that TiO2:ZnO/p-Si diodes can be used as a sensor in optic communications and optoelectronic applications.
Application of Laser-induced Photocharge Voltage spectroscopy in semiconductor testing
 A system for evaluating the surface electrical properties of semiconductor wafers and devices using Laser-induced Photocharge Voltage (PV) measurements is proposed. The optically induced electric charge is measured capacitively, thus PV measurements do not require the fabrication of metal contacts. The Photocharge voltage is a function of the electrical properties of the surface of the semiconductor sample, hence the spatial variation of PV can be utilized to evaluate the surface conditions of the sample. Similar to many optical characterization methods, the proposed technique is completely contactless and it can be used as an in-line nondestructive characterization of semiconductor wafers during the various stages of integrated circuits fabriction. Experimental results and a qualitative explanation of the Photocharge effect are presented. The design of an automatic testing probe to be used for semiconductor wafer characterization in a computer-feedback system for a integrated circuit (IC) processing is also presented. The high spatial resolution of the laser beam coupled with the development of a capacitive testing probe using fiber optics will yield a high spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm, which is well beyond any resolution currently obtainable by any electrical testing procedure in the IC manufacturing environment.
Intracellular Ca2+ transients in isolated perfused rat heart: measurement using the fluorescent indicator Fura-2AM
 We have investigated the nature of Fura-2AM loading into isolated perfused rat heart and the temporal and kinetic relationship between left ventricular [Ca2+]i dependent fluorescence and isovolumic pressure. The contribution of hydrolysed mitochondrial matrix Fura-2 fluorescence to that measured from the surface of the heart was estimated to be 43.9 ± 5.5% by the addition of 100 μM Mn2+ to the perfusate. Maximum endothelial Fura-2 fluorescence ratio, estimated by the addition of 3 μM bradykinin to the perfusate, was found to constitute 33.6 ± 2.7% of the maximum myocardial Fura-2 fluorescence ratio. Approximately 11.2% of the 340 nm surface fluorescence was insensitive to 20 mM Mn2+ in the presence of ionomycin (3 μM) and therefore indicates the degree of partial hydrolysis of Fura-2AM. Thus, depending on the contribution of endothelial Fura-2 fluorescence at a physiological endothelial calcium concentration, cytosolic fluorescence may comprise between 11–45% of the total cellular fluorescence at 340 nm. Net tissue interference of the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio by NADH emission and myoglobin absorption remained unaltered, providing the oxygenation state of the tissue was unaltered throughout the experiment. The [Ca2+]i dependent fluorescence decay from peak systole was best fitted to a biexponential decay with fast and slow rate constants of 18.08 ± 1.97 s−1 and 0.23 ± 0.02 s−1, respectively. In addition, a phase shift was observed between temporal and kinetic measurements of the left ventricular isovolumic pressure and calcium dependent fluorescence traces during a contraction-relaxation cycle. We conclude that despite imperfect Fura-2AM loading, the temporal and kinetic characteristics of intracellular [Ca2+] transients in normal isolated perfused rat heart are similar to those reported in more controlled preparations such as isolated myocytes and cardiac trabeculae.
Enhanced performance of PV power control using model predictive control
 This paper focuses on the use of model predictive control (MPC) to control a DC/DC boost converter in order to regulate the PV power. When integrated with the grid, the PV system must deliver maximum power most of the time; however, if a voltage sag occurs, new grid codes demand that the control system should limit the PV power generated to avoid over current conditions and, consequently, a grid disconnection. Maximum and reduced power modes are implemented following the MPC strategy to achieve high–performance and stable operation in the system. First, the system is modeled in Matlab/Simulink and PLECS to understand its operation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Secondly, experimental results are verified using the control hardware–in–the–loop (CHIL) approach on the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).
A non-communication based protection algorithm for multi-terminal HVDC grids
 This paper introduces a non-communication based protection algorithm for Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MTHVDC) transmission lines. The algorithm relies on using electrical current data at one end for identification of the fault zone without communication between relays. The concept is to use the fault generated transients to differentiate between internal and external faults. Shunt capacitors with predetermined values are installed at the boundary between each two HVDC line sections to assist, together with the busbar stray capacitance, in the classification of internal faults. The high frequency transients will reach the relaying point without any attenuation if the fault is internal; nevertheless, the high frequency transients will be highly attenuated if the fault is external due to the stray capacitance and the installed shunt capacitor at the connection busbar. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to analyze the fault current signals. MTHVDC system modeling and relay design are carried out in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The results of the proposed algorithm were highly reliable regarding different types of faults with different fault resistances and at various locations.
Infrared temperature measurements in micro-channels and micro-fluid systems
 This is a critical analysis of the application of infrared technique on devices in the range of tens to hundreds of micro-meters. Such devices are typical in micro-scale systems. Investigations performed during the last decade were used to analyze the specific features of micro-scale IR measurements. The method is illustrated by various examples of heat transfer determination using image analysis of the heater temperature as well as direct measurement of the liquid temperature.
Light scattering in brain slices measured with a photon counting fiber optic system
 Measurements of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) from neural tissue, commonly with a reflection-type or transmittance-type set-up, have been used increasingly to study physiological events. Even for the same event, however, such as spreading depression (SD) or osmotic challenge, signals of opposite polarities (increase or decrease) have been obtained by different investigators using similar set-ups under similar conditions. The origin of the inconsistencies is still unknown. It is suggested here that the inconsistencies may be caused by artifacts associated with tissue surface scattering. The main goal of this paper was to present a photon counting fiber optic (PCFO) system designed to exclude surface artifacts and predominantly measure the light scattering (LS) within the tissue. Experiments on rat neocortical slices under osmotic challenges demonstrated the consistency of the PCFO data: hypertonic challenge always increased LS signal while hypotonic challenge decreased it, as long as the challenge did not induce SD. Under strong osmotic challenge (−100 mOsm), the signal suddenly reversed the polarity at the onset of SD induced by the challenge and continued to increase until the challenge was removed. When SD was blocked by high [Mg2+]o, the LS signal remained decreased during the −100 mOsm challenge. A spectroscopic study with the PCFO system showed that the spectrum of tissue scattering was almost a flat function in most of the visible range (650–470 nm) with a maximum at 500 nm and a rapid drop at 450 nm.
Active Mechanisms of Vibration Encoding and Frequency Filtering in Central Mechanosensory Neurons
 To better understand biophysical mechanisms of mechanosensory processing, we investigated two cell types in the Drosophila brain (A2 and B1 cells) that are postsynaptic to antennal vibration receptors. A2 cells receive excitatory synaptic currents in response to both directions of movement: thus, twice per vibration cycle. The membrane acts as a low-pass filter, so that voltage and spiking mainly track the vibration envelope rather than individual cycles. By contrast, B1 cells are excited by only forward or backward movement, meaning they are sensitive to vibration phase. They receive oscillatory synaptic currents at the stimulus frequency, and they bandpass filter these inputs to favor specific frequencies. Different cells prefer different frequencies, due to differences in their voltage-gated conductances. Both Na+ and K+ conductances suppress low-frequency synaptic inputs, so cells with larger voltage-gated conductances prefer higher frequencies. These results illustrate how membrane properties and voltage-gated conductances can extract distinct stimulus features into parallel channels.
Design of protection schemes for multi-terminal HVDC systems
 Multi-terminal HVDC is an important new technology for bulk power transfer from large sources of remote renewables to large load centers. Recently MTDC grids have become more technically feasible due to improvements in VSC based converters, which can reverse currents and generally have greater control than LCC. Furthermore, emerging DC breakers technology unlocks the possibility of de-energizing only the faulted section of an MTDC without losing the whole grid. The protection relaying in such grids is not trivial: it must be very reliable, robust to the converter control system׳s effect on the post fault transients and act quickly, before the fault current develops beyond the presently modest interrupt capability of DC breakers. Within this challenging environment, this paper discusses in detail the important considerations for designing MTDC protection, including accurate modeling of the converter topology, associated control scheme and the DC link itself, supported by the results of novel transient simulation studies. This context is then used to appraise the suitability of the existing protection of HVDC and MTDC grids and suggests future work in the area.
Different responses of the retinal and cutaneous microcirculation to transient dysmetabolic conditions
 This study evaluated the responses of the retinal and cutaneous microcirculation to acute hyperlipidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. Twenty-five clinically healthy men (mean age 24 ± 2 years) were studied four times in a randomized order, with intervals of at least one week between the two dietary interventions always preceded by a day for baseline assessment. The two interventions consisted of either 0.1 g/kg l-methionine to induce hyperhomocysteinemia or of 500 ml whipping cream (30% fat) to induce hyperlipidemia. Microvascular vasodilator responses to flickering-light and to cutaneous acetylcholine iontophoresis were assessed by retinal vessel analysis and laser Doppler flowmetry respectively. The fat load produced significant increases in triglycerides and total cholesterol which was accompanied by a reduction of the retinal arterial flicker response. Methionine administration induced a threefold increase in homocysteine levels and a concomitant decrease in retinal venous flicker response. Acute hyperlipidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia had no effect on cutaneous microvascular vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. The inter- and intra-subject reproducibility was higher for retinal vessel analysis as compared to laser Doppler flowmetry. The retinal microcirculation is more sensitive to metabolic changes than the cutaneous microcirculation and can be reliably assessed by retinal vessel analysis. Reproducibility of retinal vessel analysis may be enhanced by multi-vessel assessment.
Electro-optic and Piezoelectric Coefficients and Refractive Index of Gallium Phosphide
 Measurements of the constant-strain electro-optic coefficient of GaP between 0.56 and 3.39 μ wavelength were made using both pulsed electric field and optical heterodyne techniques. At 0.6328 μ wavelength its value is − 0.97 ×10−1 m/V. A dispersion of only 10% is present between 0.56 and 3.39 μ Approximate values of the piezoelectric coefficient and the constant-stress electro-optic coefficient are also obtained from the analysis of the experiments. For GaP the magnitude of the constant-stress coefficient is less than the constant-strain coefficient. The analysis also points out an often ignored effect: electro-optic measurements made with electric field frequencies in the range of resonant acoustic frequencies may not exhibit the expected symmetry of the crystal plus field but may also evidence effects from the crystal shape. Accurate refractive index measurements made on many GaP crystals between 0.545 and 0.70 μ wavelength are also reported.
Role of ionic strength on protein fouling during ultrafiltration by synchronized UV–vis spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
 In this work, a filtration cell for synchronized UV–vis spectroscopic and electrochemical impedance investigation of the membrane fouling process has been designed. The setup achieves in situ monitoring of the interfacial region during filtration by fiber-optic UV–vis spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The influence of ionic strength on protein fouling of membrane was investigated in detail. Results indicate that the flux decline rate decreased slightly when the ionic strengths increased from 0 to 10 and 100 mM during initial filtration stage, however, membrane fouling at higher ionic strengths became more serious at longer fouling duration. This was mainly due to the generation of concentration polarization (CP) and electroosmotic back flow (EOBF) for longer duration, which caused elevated concentration of salt ions near the membrane surface and additional filtration resistance, and accompanied by salting-out dehydration of protein on membrane surface. This is the process that occurs in protein fouling during long-term run, the hydration forces experience from enhancement to disappearance. This study not only expends our knowledge of the effect of ionic strength on protein fouling behavior but also provides a method for the in situ and real time characterization of membrane-solution interface and filtration performance.
Evaluation of methods for determining food surface temperature in the presence of low-pressure cool plasma
 Cool plasma technology is being developed for decontamination and modification of food surfaces. Microwave cool plasmas generated at low pressures, between 0.1 and 2 mbar, are generally believed to induce only weak heating of food surfaces, with effective temperatures below 60 °C, and, therefore, to be suitable for the treatment of thermo-labile materials. Measurement techniques suitable for determining the temperature of product surfaces undergoing plasma treatment are essential to confirm that the temperature is acceptably low, and for effective process control. The harsh environment in the plasma treatment chamber, including the low pressure and the presence of electromagnetic fields, electrons and other reactive species, such as ions, excited molecules and radicals, poses a challenge to establishing reliable and reproducible techniques for surface temperature measurement. This paper compares the performance of fiber-optic probes, thermocouples (with and without sheaths), resistance thermometers, Thermochrons (temperature loggers) and temperature indicators (color changing strips and tapes) under low-pressure microwave cool plasma conditions. Both the reliability of the temperature measurement and the response time are considered. It is found that the fiber-optic probe is the only method that both has an acceptably fast response time and is not susceptible to interference from the plasma environment. Cool plasma technology is being investigated and developed for decontamination of food surfaces. The technology is being considered as very promising alternative to chemical and/or heat processing, particularly for the decontamination of fresh produce and dry food products, such as seeds and nuts, but also powders. The low temperatures on food surfaces, with effective temperatures below 60 °C, make the process suitable for the treatment of thermo-labile materials. Measuring the temperature of product surfaces undergoing plasma treatment is essential to both confirm that the temperature is acceptably low, and for effective process control. The harsh environment in cool plasma, including the presence of electromagnetic fields, electrons and other reactive species, however, poses a challenge to establishing reliable and reproducible techniques for surface temperature measurement. For industrial uptake of the technology not only the process validation from a food safety perspective is important, but also the capability of fast and accurate temperature sensing. The findings of this study allow food and equipment manufacturers to choose the most appropriate temperature measurement system for temperature control in an industrial low pressure cool plasma process.
Characterization of the global network of optical magnetometers to search for exotic physics (GNOME)
 The Global Network of Optical Magnetometers to search for Exotic physics (GNOME) is a network of geographically separated, time-synchronized, optically pumped atomic magnetometers that is being used to search for correlated transient signals heralding exotic physics. The GNOME is sensitive to nuclear- and electron-spin couplings to exotic fields from astrophysical sources such as compact dark-matter objects (for example, axion stars and domain walls). Properties of the GNOME sensors such as sensitivity, bandwidth, and noise characteristics are studied in the present work, and features of the network’s operation (e.g., data acquisition, format, storage, and diagnostics) are described. Characterization of the GNOME is a key prerequisite to searches for and identification of exotic physics signatures.
Spatial void fraction measurement in an upward gas–liquid flow on the slug regime
 Spatial void fraction measurements of a vertical upward air–water flow on the slug regime are made. The experimental technique uses simultaneously a contact needle and two single wire sensors. The data processing combines the information of both types of sensors. The liquid slug local void fractions along the radial and axial directions are estimated employing time and ensemble averages. The spatial void fraction along the axial direction disclosed two patterns, one associated to the pipe core and the other near the wall. The data is further processed to render the average void fraction along the radial and axial directions and the slug unit void fraction profile. Uncertainty analysis and data consistency tests are applied the check data reliability.
Surface plasmon resonance monitoring of temperature via phase measurement
 The application of surface plasmon resonance to the monitoring of the temperature of a metal film and its environment is well-established. A new feature in our present experimental work is to carry out this monitoring via the measurement of the phase difference between a s and a p-polarized wave at different wavelengths, 632.8 nm and 1.15 μm, based on a technique established previously in the literature. By monitoring the change of this phase as a function of the film temperature, it is found that this approach leads to very sensitive measurements of temperature, in comparison with previous approaches in which reflectance was measured instead. Sensitivity is 0.027 K at incident wavelength of 632.8 nm and 0.1 K at incident wavelength of 1.15 μm. A simple model based on the temperature dependence of the optical constants of the metal is applied to simulate our measurements, and it is found that the general qualitative behavior and trend of the experimental results can be reasonably accounted for using such a model.
Optomotor-blind of Drosophila melanogaster: a neurogenetic approach to optic lobe development and optomotor behaviour
 The gene optomotor-blind (omb) plays a crucial role in Drosophila optic lobe development. Various mutations in omb lead to different structural defects in the adult optic lobes with correlated behavioural phenotypes. Molecular analysis of omb allows one to trace back behavioural defects to the spatio-temporal misexpression of the gene in mutant development.
Emerging assembly of ZnO-nanowires/graphene dispersed liquid crystal for switchable device modulation
 The significant role of hydrogen-bonding (H) interactions in the formation and/or stabilization of liquid crystalline phases have been recognized in recent years and excellent work has been conducted. Following the first and well-established examples of nanomaterials and graphene dispersed liquid crystal (NDLC/GDLC) matrix formation through the dimerization of aromatic carboxylic acids. ZnO-nanowires/graphene dispersed with liquid crystal composites based on H-bonding were explored using a model system. Several classes of hybrid compounds have been prepared by the interaction of complementary molecules, the liquid crystalline behavior of which is crucially dependent on the structure of the resulting supramolecular systems. We present the nanosecond electro-optic response of liquid crystal (LC) in the nematic and isotropic phases. The results demonstrate that in the isotropic phase and both are dielectrically positive and negative liquid crystal belongs to a larger field induced birefringence than in the nematic phase. This also leads to the formation of supramolecular complexes that may exhibit thermotropic liquid crystalline character. Depending on the nature, number and position of the groups able to form hydrogen bonds (H-), a diversity of supramolecular structures, both dimeric and polymeric, have been obtained, affording in turn various liquid crystalline phases. Smart LC cells with electrodes made of graphene, attributes an excellent performance with a high contrast ratio. The feature article investigates the advantages of graphene compared to conventional use metal oxides in terms of low resistivity, high transparency, and chemical stability. Observed various textural phases due to nanostructures and stability of these HBLC hybrid complexes, may have benefits for the ultrafast novel electro-optic applications in smart switchable device modulation, optoelectronic and optical shutters those brand new features well established.
Nitric oxide toxicity in CNS white matter: an in vitro study using rat optic nerve
 Excessive nitric oxide formation may contribute to the pathology occurring in diseases affecting central white matter, such as multiple sclerosis. The rat isolated optic nerve preparation was used to investigate the potential toxicity of the molecule towards such tissue. The nerves were exposed to a range of concentrations of different classes of nitric oxide donor for up to 23 h, with or without a subsequent period of recovery, and the damage assessed by quantitative histological methods. Degeneration of axons and macroglia occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, the order of susceptibility being: axons>oligodendrocytes>astrocytes. Use of NONOate donors differing in half-life indicated that nitric oxide delivered in an enduring manner at relatively low concentration was more toxic than the same amount supplied rapidly at high concentration. The mechanism by which nitric oxide affects axons was studied using a donor [3-(n-propylamino)propylamine/NO adduct, PAPA/NO] with an intermediate half-life that produced selective axonopathy after a 2-h exposure (plus 2 h recovery). Axon damage was abolished if, during the exposure, Na+ or Ca2+ was removed from the bathing medium or the sodium channel inhibitors tetrodotoxin or BW619C89 (sipatrigine) were added. In electrophysiological experiments, the donor elicited a biphasic depolarisation. The second, larger component (occurring after 7–10 min) was associated with a block of nerve conduction and could be inhibited by tetrodotoxin. Coincident with the secondary depolarisation was a reduction in ATP levels by about 50%, an effect that was also inhibited by tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that nitric oxide, in submicromolar concentrations, can kill axons and macroglia in white matter. The findings lend support to the hypothesis that nitric oxide may be of importance to white matter pathologies, particularly those in which inducible nitric oxide synthase is expressed. The axonopathy, at least when elicited over relatively short time intervals, is likely to be caused by metabolic inhibition. As in anoxia and anoxia/aglycaemia, nitric oxide-induced destruction of axons is likely to be caused by the Ca2+ overload that follows a reduction in ATP levels in the face of continued influx of Na+ through voltage-dependent channels.
Polydisperse size data from single electric birefringence transients
 When a suspension of anisotropic, sub-micron sized particles is subjected to an electric pulse, the medium becomes birefringent in a transient manner. An analysis is presented of the post field relaxation of the transient response from a dilute, polydisperse suspension of rigid colloidal particles. Two averaged parameters relating to the rotational diffusion coefficient D, namely <D> and <1/D> are defined which are obtained from the initial rate of the decay data and from the area under the decay curve respectively. The averages are weighted according to the geometric shape and electrical properties of the particles. Measurement of these averages leads directly to the evaluation of an equivalent log-normal distribution of particle major dimension. By considering the implications of the theory for both high and low field data, a method of evaluating the electrical characteristics of the particles is indicated. Representative results are given.
Erroneous measurement detection in substation automation system using OLS based RBF neural network
 With the development of communication and information technology over the past decades, Electronic Instrumental Transducer (EIT) and broadband communication network have been prevalent within Substation Automation System (SAS) and power utilities. Since mal-function of EIT and broadband communication network within SAS can produce dangerous erroneous measurements, the risk for the protection system to receive these erroneous measurements and thereafter to mis-operate increase. Pattern identification can be utilized to detect erroneous measurements. In order to achieve satisfying pattern identification precision within time limit imposed by protection systems, Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) are investigated in the paper. Orthogonal Least Square (OLS) learning algorithm is used to prune network scale in order to mitigate contradictory requirements of high precision and low time delay. Simulation results show OLS based RBFNN can achieve satisfying performance within limited time.
Simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ transients and changes in the cell volume and microviscosity of the plasma membrane in smooth muscle cells
 The effects of the β2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol (50 nM) on the angiotensin II (20 nM)-induced Ca2+ response and changes in the cell volume and microviscosity of the plasma membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells were studied. Applied as a model substance for the stimulation of the phosphoinositide-phospholipase C pathway, angiotensin II has been used to simulate the bronchospasm of smooth muscle in asthma. Our results demonstrated that angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle contraction primarily involves an InsP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and, to a minor extent, an enhanced influx of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane. Both the Ca2+ response and the contractile reaction were strongly antagonized by pretreatment of the cells with 50 nM formoterol. The protective effect of formoterol on smooth muscle contractions is proposed to be mainly related to a direct stimulation of β2-adrenoceptor-coupled cAMP generation. Moreover, it is predicted that the interaction between the β2-adrenoceptor glycoprotein and adenylate cyclase will be enhanced following a formoterol-associated decrease in the microviscosity of the plasma membrane.
A new fibre-optic liquid crystal catheter for oxygen saturation and blood flow measurements in the coronary sinus
 A new catheter for oxygen saturation and thermodilution measurements in the coronary sinus is described. The distinctive feature of this catheter is a new cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) temperature sensor. Described in brief are the constructive and performance characteristics of this sensor, which permits temperature measurement by means of luminous pulses transmitted through optical fibres. The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of patient safety and instrumental integration of the thermodilution and oxygen saturation measurements, both achieved through reflection photometry via optical fibres. Two possible configurations of the new catheter, with a double or a single optical connector, are illustrated and the instruments designed to be used with each catheter, are also described. Preliminary animal experiments on the application of the new catheter for the study of the coronary circulation are finally reported.
Use of voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings in the central nervous system
 Understanding the spatio-temporal features of the information processing occurring in any complex neural structure requires the monitoring and analysis of the activity in populations of neurons. Electrophysiological and other mapping techniques have provided important insights into the function of neural circuits and neural populations in many systems. However, there remain limitations with these approaches. Therefore, complementary techniques which permit the monitoring of the spatio-temporal activity in neuronal populations are of continued interest. One promising approach to monitor the electrical activity in populations of neurons or on multiple sites of a single neuron is with voltage-sensitive dyes coupled with optical recording techniques. This review concentrates on the use of voltage-sensitive dyes and optical imaging as tools to study the activity in neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Focusing on ‘fast’ voltage-sensitive dyes first, several technical issues and developments in optical imaging will be reviewed. These will include more recent developments in voltage-sensitive dyes as well as newer developments in optical recording technology. Second, studies using voltage-sensitive dyes to investigate information processing questions in the central nervous system and in the invertebrate nervous system will be reviewed. Some emphasis will be placed on the cerebellum, but the major goal is to survey how voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings have been utilized in the central nervous system. The review will include optical studies on the visual, auditory, olfactory, somatosensory, auditory, hippocampal and brainstem systems, as well as single cell studies addressing information processing questions. Discussion of the intrinsic optical signals is also included. The review attempts to show how voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings can be used to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of neuronal activity.
Diode laser frequency stabilization to transient spectral holes and spectral diffusion in Er3+ : Y2SiO5 at 1536 nm
 Diode laser frequency stabilization to 500 Hz Allan deviation is demonstrated over 2 ms integration times with drift reduced to 7 kHz/min. This was achieved at 1536 nm in the technologically important communications band by stabilizing external cavity diode lasers to regenerative transient spectral holes in the inhomogeneously broadened 4I15/2(1)→4I13/2(1) optical absorption of Er3+ : Y2SiO5. Spectral diffusion, which currently limits the achievable stabilization performance, has been studied using stimulated photon echoes. Due to spectral diffusion, significant broadening of the homogeneous linewidth at low magnetic fields from a few kHz to tens of kHz develops as the waiting time T between pulses two and three was increased from microseconds up to the T1∼10 ms lifetime of the excited state. This evolution of the homogeneous linewidth has been mapped out as a function of magnetic field. The classic spectral diffusion can be reduced to negligible levels upon application of a magnetic field in a 0.02 atomic percent Er3+ : Y2SiO5 crystal.
A simple technique for automated performance testing of piezoelectric micro-motors by transient motion analysis
 An automated method of testing a 5 mm diameter flextensional ultrasonic motor has been assembled using off-the-shelf components, which derives performance measurements from the transient start up and stopping behaviour of the motor using a non-contact position encoder. The method gives full performance characteristics in less than a second and it is scaleable for use with other sizes and other types of motor. Furthermore, it provides a relatively simple technique for non-contact measurements of position, angle or velocity that can be rapidly cycled as part of a development programme. The method has shown sufficient sensitivity, using basic components, to measure torque in the range 10–200 μN m and speed in the range from 0 to over 2000 rpm. The torque and speed ranges are only dependant on the sensitivity of encoder instrumentation, inertial load on the motor and data acquisition. This system is believed to be a significant improvement over previously reported work that has detailed friction brake or manual ‘one-off’ systems and the test format has greater applicability for micro-motors that are used for their positioning capabilities.
Pantograph–catenary monitoring by means of fibre Bragg grating sensors: Results from tests in an underground line
 One of the most common way to collect the traction current needed for the underground vehicle operation is by using the pantograph–overhead line system. The periodically check of pantographs and overhead lines is important to assure the correct interaction between the two systems in terms of good current collection quality. The main diagnostic tools are the monitoring of the vertical force between the overhead line and the pantograph head, and the vertical acceleration on the pantograph head. The pantograph system works under high voltage (1500 V, DC, in our tests) and high electromagnetic disturbances are present. For this reason, traditional electrical sensors can be used only with particular precautions that complicate the measurement set up; fibre optic sensors, and in particular fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, are particularly suitable for this application. In this paper, the application of the FBG sensors on a pantograph for the monitoring of underground pantograph–catenary system is presented. FBG sensors are used to measure both the contact force and the vertical acceleration of the pantograph head. The same measurements are also gathered with a traditional electrical system, allowing a comparison. The result is a very good agreement between electrical and optical measurements, except in particular frequency ranges where the different positioning of the sensors influences the output, limiting the comparison. Moreover, some interesting results on the dynamic behaviour of the pantograph and its interaction with the overhead line are presented. Finally, a method to point out the main defects on the overhead line is shown.
Axial-Wire Voltage Clamping in Crayfish Medial Giant Axons
 This chapter focuses on axial-wire voltage clamping in crayfish medial giant axons. The crayfish medial giant axon preparation provides substantial advantages for axial-wire voltage-clamp studies on axonal sodium channels in their native membrane. Crayfish are inexpensive and readily available on a year-round basis. The axoplasm is fluid and easily washed out of the axon when the internal perfusate is driven by a very low hydrostatic pressure head to yield a clean membrane preparation without requiring either dialysis, enzymatic, or roller techniques for axoplasm removal. The crayfish Schwann cells permit very rapid re-equilibration of periaxonal ion concentrations. The close spacing of the tubular lattice openings reduces the possibility that microscopic space clamp errors can arise from the lateral resistance of the Frankenhaeuser–Hodgkin space. Current magnitudes are sufficient to permit detailed measurements of ionic and gating current kinetics without some of the problems inherent in the squid axon system. The crayfish voltage-clamp electrode designed by Shrager is constructed as a piggy-back electrode. The piggy-back electrode can be used either for the intact axon or for the perfused axon.

Full-length transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channels mediate calcium signals and possibly contribute to osmoreception in vasopressin neurones in the rat supraoptic nucleus
 Neurones in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus possess intrinsic osmosensing mechanisms, which are lost in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1)-knock-out mice. The molecular nature of the osmosensory mechanism in SON neurones is believed to be associated with the N-terminal splice variant of Trpv1, although their entire molecular structures have not been hitherto identified. In this study, we sought for TRPV1-related molecules and their function in the rat SON. We performed RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to detect TRPV1-related molecules in the SON, and patch-clamp and imaging of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to measure responses to osmolality changes and TRPV-related drugs in acutely dissociated SON neurones of rats. RT-PCR analysis revealed full-length Trpv1 and a new N-terminal splice variant, Trpv1_SON (LC008303) in the SON. Positive immunostaining was observed using an antibody against the N-terminal portion of TRPV1 in arginine vasopressin (AVP)-immunoreactive neurones, but not in oxytocin (OT)-immunoreactive neurones. Approximately 20% of SON neurones responded to mannitol (50 mM) with increased action potential firing, inward currents, and [Ca2+]i mobilization. Mannitol-induced responses were observed in AVP neurones isolated from AVP-eGFP transgenic rats and identified by GFP fluorescence, but not in OT neurones isolated from OT-mRFP transgenic rats and identified by RFP fluorescence. The mannitol-induced [Ca2+]i responses were reversibly blocked by the non-selective TRPV antagonist, ruthenium red (10 μM) and the TRPV1 antagonists, capsazepine (10 μM) and BCTC (10 μM). Although the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (100 nM) evoked no response at room temperature, it triggered cationic currents and [Ca2+]i elevation when the temperature was increased to 36 °C. These results suggest that AVP neurones in the rat SON possess functional full-length TRPV1. Moreover, differences between the responses to capsaicin or hyperosmolality obtained in rat SON neurones and those obtained from dorsal root ganglion neurones or TRPV1-expressing cells indicate that the osmoreceptor expressed in the SON may be a heteromultimer in which TRPV1 is co-assembled with some other, yet unidentified, molecules.
Heat transfer characteristics and mechanisms along entire boiling curves under steady-state and transient conditions
 The paper presents a survey of results found by the authors and their groups during recent years. An experimental technique for precise and systematic measurements of entire boiling curves under steady-state and transient conditions has been developed. Pool boiling experiments for well wetting fluids and fluids with a larger contact angle (FC-72, isopropanol, water) yield single and reproducible boiling curves if the system is clean. However, even minimal deposits on the surface change the heat transfer characteristic and shift the boiling curve with each test run. The situation is different under transient conditions: heating and cooling transients yield different curves even on clean surfaces. Measurements with micro-optical probes give an insight in the two-phase dynamics above the heating surface in the different boiling regimes. Temperature signals from microthermocouples at the surface and the optical probe data lead to some conclusions on the physics of boiling in different regimes such as the macrolayer configuration, the dry-spot size and dynamics, the nucleation site density etc. The high density of active nucleation sites in the region between fully developed nucleate boiling and critical heat flux (CHF) and the resulting highly turbulent two-phase boundary layer let us conclude that the strong increase of heat flux in heating transients and vice versa in a cooling process is mainly due to the intensive two-phase convection heat transfer from the wall to the bulk and not due to inertia effects in the two-phase structure dynamics. The latter is not significantly affected by temperature transients. An interfacial-area-density model is proposed. It needs data from the optical probes and enables the prediction of entire boiling curves by employing only one fitting parameter. Furthermore the concept of a reaction–diffusion model is presented to predict CHF. Here the triggering of CHF is due to an instability of dry spots on the heating surface. Data from microthermocouples and optical probes are needed to evaluate this model. Many aspects of the extremely complex mechanisms of boiling are still not sufficiently understood. The problems should be tackled from both the experimental and the theoretical end and both approaches should be closely linked.
Irregular Pupil Cycling as a Characteristic Abnormality in Patients with Demyelinative Optic Neuropathy
 We used an infrared videopupillometer combined with an electronic circuit that regulated the retinal light level as a function of pupil area to assess the regularity of pupil cycling in normal subjects and in patients with known abnormalities in the pupil light reflex pathways. The light stimulus was turned on whenever pupil area exceeded a preset value. Two types of abnormalities were observed for patients with demyelinative optic neuropathy: a failure of the pupil to cycle despite a preserved pupillary response to a single light pulse; and, for those patients in whom cycling was possible, a characteristic intermittent irregularity in the amplitude of pupil cycling. These abnormalities were not seen in normal subjects or in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy, surgical lesions involving the optic chiasm, Adie's syndrome, or Horner's syndrome.
Fibre-optic sensor for the determination of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons with time-resolved, laser-induced fluorescence
 For in situ and on-line detection of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water, a fibre-optic sensor system with a fibre length of 50 m is presented. Laser-induced, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy allows detection limits in the ng l−1 range. Analytical figures of merit are given for thirteen environmentally relevant PAHs in water. First results for a binary mixture of fluoranthene and pyrene are presented. A deconvolution algorithm is described that simplifies the analysis of time-resolved emission spectra of single- and multi-component PAH mixtures.
An adaptive approach for three zone operation of digital distance relay with Static Var Compensator using PMU
 Modern energy transmission systems suffer from great voltage dropping due to enormous loads. Therefore appropriate schemes should be devised to regulate the voltage. FACTS devices such as Static Var Compensator are often used for this purpose. However, SVC at mid-point of transmission line may leads to deteriorate of distance relay operation, resulting in inaccurate estimation of faults locations i.e. over-reach or under reach for different cases. This paper proposed a new algorithm that utilizes synchronized phasors measurement (SPM) to enhance the operation of distance protection zone in many aspects. The proposed method is tested for 230 kV system simulated in EMTDC/PSCAD with Bergeron model of transmission line. The results prevailed for adaptive approach scheme are more accurate, victor and robust in equivalence with usable transmission line distance protection with SVC.
Microring stereo sensor model using Kerr–Vernier effect for bio-cell sensor and communication
 In this paper, a micro-stereo sensor is proposed using two-identical Panda-ring resonators, which are coupled by jointed drop ports. When light from the identical coherent sources is fed into the system via the input ports, the coupling outputs are obtained at the drop port at the resonant condition. These are mixed signals in the form of stereo signals. By using different input power between the right and left systems, the phase difference generated by the Kerr-Effect in the non-linear medium leads to the shift in the coupling outputs. The shift in the center wavelength is the primary measurement of interest along with coupling crosstalk signals that are also visible at the output. The measurement self-calibration of the two channels is confirmed by the mixed channel signals. In the manipulation, the crosstalk signals can be used to interpret the cross-communication of bio-cells. The crosstalk results have shown the optical crosstalks of ∼2.0 and ∼2.5 dB are calculated and obtained, respectively. The stereo sensor sensitivity of ∼5.70 nmW−1 is noted.
A review of developments in thermal techniques for charge profile measurements in polymer electrets
 A number of methods were evolved during last three decades to understand the internal charge profile of polymer electrets. These methods essentially are based on the propagation of heat or pressure waves inside the charged samples. In both cases, electrical signals are generated due to mechanical or dielectric changes caused by heat diffusion or propagation of a pressure discontinuity in the sample. The charge distribution can be obtained from the electrical response. This paper presents detailed information on the thermal techniques to probe the charge distributions in the thickness direction of the polymer electrets as well as a comprehensive review of thermal data analysis.
A modular data and control system to improve sensitivity, selectivity, speed of analysis, ease of use, and transient duration in an external source FTICR-MS
 We present here a new Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) controller designed and constructed to meet the growing need for increased speed, memory, and ease of use. The system realizes these goals via the first published application of fast PXI bus technology and by employing a graphical user interface (GUI) for control of all aspects of ion production, delivery, containment, manipulation of internal and kinetic energies, and measurement in an external source instrument. Additionally, new hardware for monitoring and control of these aspects and for processing extended datasets both to and from the instrument have been implemented. The modular nature of the control hardware makes the instrument platform, in this case a modified external source 7T FTICR-MS, irrelevant. The GUI consists of two separate modules; one provides a temporal representation of the pulses, voltages (rf and dc), and dc heater currents that control all aspects of the experiment while the other provides complex data analysis capabilities and design of excitation waveforms. Real-time monitoring of the transient signal is available in this module as well as near real-time monitoring of the resulting mass spectrum (using a truncated dataset). A PXI bus with 40 digital to analog converters (DAC) and 64 digital (TTL) sources drive the source, optics, and trapping functions of the instrument as well as the other peripheral hardware. Acquisition is realized using a VME bus with a TTL triggered program resident on an embedded processor to minimize dead time. The acquisition system is equipped with 192 MB memory for both excitation and detection waveforms with FIFO buffering to provide full rate bandwidth of 10 MHz, and four digital down converters (DDCs) to enable mixing of heterodyne signals for narrow band measurements completes the ensemble.
Confocal imaging reveals activity-dependent intracellular Ca2+ transients in nociceptive human C fibres
 Unmyelinated nociceptive fibres are a key element in the human nociceptive system, however, it is very difficult to investigate such fibres in vivo in more detail. An alternate approach are studies on isolated human nerves. Here we describe that confocal Ca2+ imaging reveals new information about the physiology of human nociceptive C fibres. Confocal images at two emission wavelengths were collected from regions with unmyelinated nerve fibres within segments of biopsied human sural nerves stained with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes Calcium Green-1 and Fura Red. Short trains of supramaximal electrical stimuli applied to one end of the nerve as well as bath application of capsaicin resulted in an increase in the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Intracellular Ca2+ transients were seen at action potential frequencies above 1 Hz. They were absent in Ca2+-free bathing solution and reduced during bath application of cadmium. This indicates an extracellular source of the activity-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, Ca2+ transients were also observed during elevation of the extracellular K+ concentration or during short trains of calcium action potentials. Such `Ca2+ spikes' were elicited by a combination of tetrodotoxin and potassium channel blockers. These data suggest the presence of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the membrane of nociceptive human nerve fibres.
Recent developments in surface science and engineering, thin films, nanoscience, biomaterials, plasma science, and vacuum technology
 Nanometer-sized structures, surfaces and sub-surface phenomena have played an enormous role in science and technological applications and represent a driving-force of current interdisciplinary science. Recent developments include the atomic-scale characterization of nanoparticles, molecular reactions at surfaces, magnetism at the atomic scale, photoelectric characterization of nanostructures as well as two-dimensional solids. Research and development of smart nanostructured materials governed by their surface properties is a rapidly growing field. The main challenge is to develop an accurate and robust electronic structure description. The density of surface-related trap states is analyzed by transient UV photoconductivity and temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy. An advanced application of thin films on shaped substrates is the deposition of catalytic layers on hollow glass microspheres for hydrogen storage controlled exothermal hydrolytic release. Surface properties of thin films including dissolution and corrosion, fouling resistance, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are explored to improve materials response in biological environments and medicine. Trends in surface biofunctionalization routes based on vacuum techniques, together with advances in surface analysis of biomaterials, are discussed. Pioneering advances in the application of X-ray nanodiffraction of thin film cross-sections for characterizing nanostructure and local strain including in-situ experiments during nanoindentation are described. Precise measurements and control of plasma properties are important for fundamental investigations and the development of next generation plasma-based technologies. Critical control parameters are the flux and energy distribution of incident ions at reactive surfaces; it is also crucial to control the dynamics of electrons initiating non-equilibrium chemical reactions. The most promising approach involves the exploitation of complementary advantages in direct measurements combined with specifically designed numerical simulations. Exciting new developments in vacuum science and technology have focused on forward-looking and next generation standards and sensors that take advantage of photonics based measurements. These measurements are inherently fast, frequency based, easily transferrable to sensors based on photonics and hold promise of being disruptive and transformative. Realization of Pascal, the SI unit for pressure, a cold-atom trap based ultra-high and extreme high vacuum (UHV and XHV) standard, dynamic pressure measurements and a photonic based thermometer are three key examples that are presented.
Realisation of a liquid crystal based prototype for duration measurement of picosecond pulses
 Using self-diffraction technique, a prototype has been ideated and experimentally assembled for the measurement of the duration of laser pulses in the range of picoseconds. The innovative technique used is based on the presence of a dynamic diffraction grating written by the pulse on a film of liquid crystalline composite material under suitable geometrical conditions. The pulse to be measured undergoes a “self-diffraction” effect whose efficiency is related to the pulse duration. A software has been implemented both for the calculation of the pulse duration from the elaboration of experimental data and for the control of mechanical micrometric components.
Spectrum measurement of fast optical signal of neural activity in brain tissue and its theoretical origin
 Functional brain imaging technologies have enabled recent advances in understanding human brain function. In particular, a noninvasive and fast optical technique will become one of the most promising tools for future studies. As a fundamental ex vivo study for the development of such a technique, this paper demonstrates the spectral measurement of fast optical changes associated with neural activity in bulk brain tissue. For this purpose, a high-speed confocal near-infrared spectrometer was built and used. The results verified that observed transient optical responses (tORs) are associated with neural activity by showing that the following: tORs were concurrent and correlated with local field potentials (LFPs); tORs disappeared following tetrodotoxin application; and tORs were reproducibly observed across preparations. In addition, the amplitude of tORs was statistically significantly larger in longer wavelengths (∼ 1200 nm). The time course of tORs, however, is quite different from that of LFPs. Since this difference implies that tORs may originate not directly from the electric potential variation but from other neurophysiological events accompanying excitation, this paper tested the hypothesis that tORs are attributed to transient cellular volume changes (tCVCs). With no previous dynamic equation to elucidate such different temporal dynamics of the optical responses, a novel mathematical neuron model to describe tCVCs was developed. This neuron model, along with finite-difference time-domain simulations, showed that tCVCs and tORs were similar in the temporal dynamics, order of magnitude, response direction, and detectability in the bulk tissue; thus supporting the hypothesis.
Jet-guided combustion characteristics and local fuel concentration measurements in a hydrogen direct-injection spark-ignition engine
 Spark-ignition (SI) hydrogen engines based on direct injection (DI) promise significant advantages in terms of thermal efficiency and power output, and present a means of overcoming problems related to knocking, backfiring, and preignition. A better understanding of the effects of hydrogen jets on the fuel concentration distribution and mixing process in a DISI engine should provide new and useful insights into combustion optimization. The objective of the present work was to gain a deeper comprehension of the characteristics of late-injection hydrogen combustion. An experimental combustion setup was applied to a fired, jet-guided DISI engine operated at 600 rpm in stratified mode. GDI injector with the jet directed toward the spark plug was used to develop the stratified combustion concept. A high-speed camera synchronized with the spark was focused on a 52 mm-diameter field of view through a window at the bottom of the piston crown. A series of single-shot images captured at different intervals was used to study the time evolution of the flame distribution. Variations in the fuel injection timing relative ignition timing were found to impact the development of the early flame, as well as the flame propagation. This research also employed spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (SIBS) to measure the local fuel–air concentration in the spark gap at the time of ignition under stratified-charge conditions.
Cluster characteristics of continuous size distributions and binary mixtures of Group B particles in dilute riser flow
 Gas–solids circulating fluidized bed (CFB) experiments have been carried out, with a focus on understanding the impact of polydispersity on cluster characteristics in a dilute riser. Two categories of polydispersity were studied: continuous particle size distributions (PSDs) of varying distribution widths, and binary mixtures of varying compositions. Video images show that particle clusters exist even in these very dilute systems (solid loading m = 0.03–0.29). Local measurements were acquired using two independent instruments – a fiber optic probe and a high-speed video camera – with the cluster trends obtained from both are in qualitative agreement with each other. Cluster characteristics extracted from the measurements include appearance probability, duration and frequency. Results show that: (i) axial position is the strongest influence on radial profiles of cluster duration and frequency, but has negligible effect on cluster appearance probability, (ii) profile shapes are invariant with height, although magnitudes of cluster duration and frequency changes with height, and (iii) effects of both the widths of continuous PSDs and the compositions of binary mixtures are observed at the riser bottom for cluster duration and at the riser top for cluster frequency, though are insignificant for the appearance probability.
DLTS study of InGaAs and GaAsN structures with different indium and nitrogen compositions
 In this article Deep Level Transient Fourier Spectroscopy experiments and various evaluation procedures were used to study emission and capture processes of deep energy levels in intentionally undoped InGaAs and GaAsN semiconductor structures. The examined samples, grown by Atmospheric Pressure Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy on GaAs substrates, were analyzed at various indium and nitrogen concentrations. Main attention was focused on differences in defect distributions, relations in possible composition and growth condition sensitive defect states. Valuable characteristics of particular In/N contents capable to eliminate or reduce specific impurities are discussed. A possible indium dependent dual state InGaAs complex and a nitrogen and growth condition dependent dual type GaAsN complex was introduced/confirmed. The most balanced samples for further utilizations were achieved for In = 8.9% and N = 1%.
Self-sensing cavitation detection in ultrasound-induced acoustic cavitation
 The generation of cavitation by ultrasound is used in a large number of processes in different scientific and industrial applications. Chemical reactions are made possible or accelerated by locally occurring high temperatures and pressures generated by the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Mixing or separating substances, emulsification, ultrasonic cleaning, degassing, and microbiological treatment of fluids are some more applications for ultrasonic generated cavitation. In most of these applications, an optical examination of the events within the cavitating medium is not possible. Non-transparent media or closed containers prevent an optical process monitoring. In addition, the use of sensors is often impossible for cost reasons, limited construction space or disturbance of the process. In order to still enable process monitoring, the authors follow a novel approach: the analysis of the electrical signals of the ultrasound transducer used for cavitation generation. The current signal of the ultrasound transducer is inspected for frequency components, known as acoustic cavitation indicators. For this, the time signal is recorded and transferred to the frequency domain for further processing and evaluation. In previous studies, acoustical sensors like hydrophones or microphones were used as reference for the self-sensing technique. In order to link cavitation events inside the fluid container to cavitation indicators in the current signal, a photo study of the cavitation events inside a transparent water container is conducted. In contrast to previous self-sensing attempts, the ultrasound transducer’s transfer characteristic is also considered. The evaluation of the acquired data shows that a frequency component which is 3/2 times the driving frequency (∼30 kHz) can be used to determine the onset of transient cavitation. Once the transient cavitation threshold has been exceeded, broad band noise levels show a good correlation with cavitation intensity.
X-rays from negative laboratory sparks in air: Influence of the anode geometry
 In this experimental work, the influence of the grounded anode geometry is studied on the X-ray production from the laboratory sparks in air at atmospheric pressure when a negative impulse voltage is applied to a high voltage rod which served as a cathode. The result shows that the smaller the diameter of the anode, the higher the energy of X-ray bursts. This observation can be explained by the mechanism that the encounter of negative and positive streamer fronts just before the final breakdown is the event that accelerates electrons to X-ray generating energies, but may not be the only mechanism that generates X-rays.
Bit error rate reduction by power shaping in WDM networks with EDFAs
 The trend in multi-wavelength optical networks is toward dynamic route and wavelength assignment to support burst-switching or packet switching. Where erbium-doped optical amplifiers (EDFAs) are used for multi-wavelength amplifications, the time interval between traffic blocks can be long enough to induce EDFA optical power transients created by abrupt changes in the average input power to the EDFAs and can adversely affect the performance of the network. To mitigate the effects of EDFA optical power transients on optical networks, a method based on power shaping where heads and tails are joined to the beginning and end of a traffic block is proposed. A head (tail) gradually increases (decreases) the channel power by employing a pseudo-random bit sequence in which the probability of a “1” (“0”) increases from 0 to 0.5. This paper reports experimental results showing that EDFA optical power transients can be significantly reduced with adequate shaping periods. The effects of alternative shaping profiles are examined, and for a linear shaping profile, experiments show that the drop transient deviation is reduced by 0.5 dB while the add transient deviation is reduced by 0.71 dB. We show by lab experiments that the bit error rate induced by wavelength add-drop transients in a chain of EDFAs in an emulated fiber network can be reduced by 25% using power shaping techniques. Power shaping is an economical means of suppressing EDFA optical power transients compared to other physical layer approaches that require the addition of specialized components and can be applied to EDFAs as well as other solid-state and Raman optical amplifiers.
The nitric oxide-guanylate cyclase pathway and glaucoma
 Glaucoma is a prevalent optic neuropathy characterized by the progressive dysfunction and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their optic nerve axons, which leads to irreversible visual field loss. Multiple risk factors for the disease have been identified, but elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the primary risk factor amenable to treatment. Reducing IOP however does not always prevent glaucomatous neurodegeneration, and many patients progress with the disease despite having IOP in the normal range. There is increasing evidence that nitric oxide (NO) is a direct regulator of IOP and that dysfunction of the NO-Guanylate Cyclase (GC) pathway is associated with glaucoma incidence. NO has shown promise as a novel therapeutic with targeted effects that: 1) lower IOP; 2) increase ocular blood flow; and 3) confer neuroprotection. The various effects of NO in the eye appear to be mediated through the activation of the GC- guanosine 3:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) pathway and its effect on downstream targets, such as protein kinases and Ca2+ channels. Although NO-donor compounds are promising as therapeutics for IOP regulation, they may not be ideal to harness the neuroprotective potential of NO signaling. Here we review evidence that supports direct targeting of GC as a novel pleiotrophic treatment for the disease, without the need for direct NO application. The identification and targeting of other factors that contribute to glaucoma would be beneficial to patients, particularly those that do not respond well to IOP-dependent interventions.
A fiber optics system for monitoring utilization of ZnO adsorbent beds during desulfurization for logistic fuel cell applications
 An in-situ fiber optic based technique for direct measurement of capacity utilization of ZnO adsorbent beds by monitoring bed color changes during desulfurization for fuel cell systems is presented. Adsorbents composed of bulk metal oxides (ZnO) and supported metal oxides (ZnO/SiO2 and CuZnO/SiO2) for H2S removal at 22 °C are examined. Adsorbent bed utilization at breakthrough is determined by the optical sensor as the maximum derivative of area under UV-vis spectrum from 250 to 800 nm observed as a function of service time. Since the response time of the sensor due to bed color change is close to bed breakthrough time, a series of probes along the bed predicts utilization of the portion of bed prior to H2S breakthrough. The efficacy of the optical sensor is evaluated as a function of inlet H2S concentration, H2S flow rate and desulfurization in presence of CO, CO2 and moisture in feed. A 6 mm optical probe is employed to measure utilization of a 3/16 inch ZnO extrudate bed for H2S removal. It is envisioned that with the application of the optical sensor, desulfurization can be carried out at high adsorbent utilization and low operational costs during on-board miniaturized fuel processing for logistic fuel cell power systems.
SPACER FLASHOVER TIME LAGS IN SF6 UNDER FAST-FRONT IMPULSE VOLTAGES
 A measurement system for studying the breakdown of insulator surfaces in sulphur hexafluoride under fast front (10 ns rise time) voltages is described. Measurements of volt-time characteristics have been made using 3 and 10 mm diameter rod electrodes in a rod-plane configuration with several insulator materials and geometries. The results show that insulator surfaces can have a significant effect on flashover voltage, volt-time characteristics, and flashover probability at very short times to breakdown.
Investigation of a DC OCT signal processing method based on an improved Kalman algorithm
 In this paper, we propose an improved Kalman filtering algorithm, to solve problems associated with processing of direct current (DC) signals in optical current transformers (OCTs). The algorithm was realized as follows. Based on the characteristics of the OCT, mixed noise was included with the parameters and state information of the measurement model, to ensure that it could be processed. State predictions and update equations for the improved Kalman algorithm were obtained, according to the minimum mean squared error criterion, using the established model. Finally, real-time noise estimation and correction was achieved by designing a recursive noise filter. Results from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the improved signal processing algorithm is effective in filtering mixed noise from DC signals measured by an OCT. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve real-time noise correction during the filtering process.
Application and assessment of laser Doppler velocimetry for underwater acoustic measurements
 The majority of traditional methods for making underwater acoustic pressure measurements involve placing all or part of a measurement transducer in the acoustic field. A variety of optical metrology techniques have been developed in an attempt to reduce or remove any perturbing effects. An example of this is the use of laser interferometry which has been developed as the primary method of calibrating hydrophones in the frequency range 500kHz–20MHz at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). This technique involves suspending a thin Mylar pellicle in the acoustic field and recording the displacement of the pellicle surface using a Michelson Interferometer. This study details a comparison of a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) with the NPL Laser Interferometer, which gives a good correlation where agreement is within approximately 4% and 7% for two different power levels from a 500kHz plane piston transducer and within 2.5% and 1% for the same power levels from a 1MHz plane piston transducer. A novel, non-perturbing method of recording temporally resolved acoustic pressure distributions in water using an LDV is also described. The technique is shown to benefit from the consistent frequency response of the LDV detection system, such that the measured output resembles the drive voltage input to the transducer more closely than a similar hydrophone measurement. For the experimental arrangement described, the LDV system is shown to be sensitive to minimum pressure amplitudes of nominally 18.9mPa/√Hz.
Transient and statistical measurement techniques for two-phase flows: A critical review
 Much work has been expended in the study of two-phase, gas-liquid flows. While it has been recognized superficially that such flows are not homogeneous in general, little attention has been paid to the inherent discreteness of the two-phase systems. It has been a relatively recent development that fluctuating characteristics of two-phase flows have been studied in detail. As a result, new experimental devices and techniques have been developed for use in obtaining measurements of quantities previously ignored. This paper reviews and summarizes these methods in an effort to emphasize the importance of the fluctuating nature of these flows and as a guide to further research in this field.
Light dosimetry measurements during ALA-PDT of Barrett's oesophagus
 A fibre optic probe and compact light detection system has been used to monitor the fluence-rate at the tissue surface during 5-aminolaevulinic acid based photodynamic therapy (PDT) of Barrett's oesophagous. The contributions from three specific wavelengths were recorded, corresponding to the combination of therapeutic laser light and fluorescence emission from protoporphyrin IX (635 nm), the fluorescence from an oxidation product of the photosensitiser (670 nm), and the protoporphyrin IX fluorescence alone (705 nm). We have found that light scattering results in an enhancement of the therapeutic fluence-rate, and hence light dose, by approximately 70%. At the onset of therapy the fluorescence provides a 10% contribution to the overall fluence-rate at 635 nm. The dynamics of photosensitiser bleaching could be extracted from the depletion in light signals. By defining a bleaching dose as the 635 nm light fluence delivered over the period during which the photosensitiser fluorescence decays to 1/e3 of its initial value, we find that the average ratio of bleaching to total dose is 33%. Further, the fluorescence contributes approximately 5% of the bleaching light dose. These results suggest that the prescribed period of therapeutic light exposure may be reduced with no loss in clinical efficacy, but with a consequent improvement in patient tolerance to this therapy.
Molecular biology of the voltage-gated sodium channel
 The integral membrane protein composing the voltage-sensitive sodium channel is a bagel-like structure (Fig. 1) with a central pore that is highly selective for sodium ions. When the electric field across a cell's membrane becomes depolarized, the pore of the channel opens to allow sodium ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient into the cell1. Voltage-gating, a common feature of all voltage-activated channels, is an essential functional property that is only now being understood in terms of the structural features of the protein.
Traveling column for comparison of invasive and non-invasive fluidization voidage measurement techniques
 This paper compares invasive and non-invasive voidage measurement techniques from five different Canadian laboratories for the determination of local voidage profiles in gas-fluidized beds of 104 μm Fluid Cracking Catalyst (FCC) and 332 μm silica sand in a column of 133 mm i.d. A novel modular system and auxiliary components were designed and constructed to facilitate transportation to, and deployment at, different research centers. Profiles of time-averaged voidage were determined by optical fiber probes, dynamic pressure measurements, electrical capacitance tomography, X-ray computed tomography and radioactive particle tracking by researchers from different research groups. These results are compared with average measurements from pressure gradients and overall bed expansion. Results were kept separate from each other in a double-blind method. There is general, but imperfect, agreement among the different methods for average voidage for both the FCC and silica sand. Invasive probes gave similar results and scatter to non-invasive techniques.
A differential laser Doppler system for one-dimensional in-plane motion measurement of MEMS
 The differential laser Doppler technique is used to measure one-dimensional in-plane motions in micro-electro-mechanical systems in this paper. This method provides real-time measurement of the velocity and derives the displacement from the integral of velocity. The working principle and optical layout of the system are explained. The vibration of the movable comb of a silicon micromachined resonator is measured by this system and the uncertainty caused by high order modes of vibration is discussed. The repeatability of displacement measurements is 0.9 μm. Compared with computer micro-vision method, there is a discrepancy of 0.5 μm in the results of maximum amplitudes of displacements.
Transient in vivo membrane depolarization and glutamate release before anoxic depolarization in rat striatum
 Increased extracellular glutamate ([GLU]e), under the condition of cerebral ischemia, anoxia or hypoxia, has been recognized as being associated with neuronal cell damage and death. We performed real-time monitoring of [GLU]e dynamics in vivo in the rat striatum during systemic acute anoxia or hypoxia, as well as monitoring the direct current potential (DC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Adult Wistar rats were orotracheally intubated and artificially ventilated with room air. A microdialysis electrode, temperature sensor probe, DC microelectrode and laser Doppler probe were then implanted. The inspired gas was changed to 100% N2 (anoxia), or to 3, 5 or 8% O2 (remainder N2) (hypoxia). With 100% N2, distinct biphasic [GLU]e elevations were observed. With 3% O2, a transient [GLU]e increase was seen before anoxic depolarization (AD). With 5% O2, however, the start of the transient [GLU]e increase was significantly delayed. Anoxia-induced depolarization started at about 100 s. The 3% O2-induced transient depolarization and AD began at nearly the same time as the transient and AD-induced increase in [GLU]e. Similarly, the responses to 5% O2 showed significant delays in the transient depolarization and AD-induced increase in [GLU]e. CBF during 3 or 5% O2 hypoxic insult was consistently maintained above the control level, i.e., prior to cardiac arrest. Our new dialysis electrode method employing both GOX and ferrocene-conjugated bovine serum albumin allowed evaluation of transient [GLU]e dynamics in the early phase of severe hypoxia in vivo.
Magneto-optic trapping of lithium using semiconductor lasers
 We present an experimental investigation of a magneto-optical trap for 7Li atoms which is operated exclusively with low-power single-mode diode lasers. A master-slave scheme based on injection locking of two diode lasers is employed to reach sufficiently high power of tunable narrowband radiation. The trap is loaded from an atomic beam which is decelerated in a compact Zeeman-slower with decreasing field resulting in trap loading rates close to 108 atoms/s. The dependence of loading rate, trap spring constant, temperature, number and density of trapped atoms on the laser parameters is studied. More than 109 atoms are accumulated at a density approaching 1011 atoms/cm3. Since the highest particle numbers are achieved at trap laser detunings of several linewidths from resonance, light-assisted inelastic collisions are of minor importance, and the number of trapped atoms is mainly limited by background gas collisions. The volume occupied by the trapped atoms is found to be independent of the particle number for densities up to 1010 atoms/cm3 and particle numbers up to 108. The lowest measured temperature 300±50 μK corresponds to a momentum spread of 7 photon recoil momenta.
Single cell analysis of voltage-gated potassium channels that determines neuronal types of rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons
 The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a site for the integration of both the neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, has heterogeneous cell composition. These neurons are classified into type I and type II neurons based on their electrophysiological properties. In the present study, we investigated the molecular identification of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, which determines a distinctive characteristic of type I PVN neurons, by means of single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) along with slice patch clamp recordings. In order to determine the mRNA expression profiles, firstly, the PVN neurons of male rats were classified into type I and type II neurons, and then, single-cell RT-PCR and single-cell real-time RT-PCR analysis were performed using the identical cell. The single-cell RT-PCR analysis revealed that Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 were expressed both in type I and in type II neurons, and several Kv channels were co-expressed in a single PVN neuron. However, we found that the expression densities of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 were significantly higher in type I neurons than in type II neurons. Taken together, several Kv channels encoding A-type K+ currents are present both in type I and in type II neurons, and among those, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are the major Kv subunits responsible for determining the distinct electrophysiological properties. Thus these 2 Kv subunits may play important roles in determining PVN cell types and regulating PVN neuronal excitability. This study further provides key molecular mechanisms for differentiating type I and type II PVN neurons.
Stark swept transient hole-burning and excited state dynamics in [Ru(bpy)3]2+
 Transient hole-burning measurements in dilute racemic [Zn(bpy)3](CIO4)2:Ru establish that intramolecular excitation transfer can be as slow as 9107 s-1 when transfer is near resonance. In an amorphous environment at 77K these intramolecular transfer processes can be faster than 2109 s-1.
Use of auto-by-cross correlation for the quantification of transient signals in multiphoton photoionization spectroscopy
 The technique of auto-by-cross correlation (ABCC) is explored as an alternative to gated integration for the quantification of transient signals in spectroscopy. ABCC combines the simplicity of autocorrelation with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) near that of cross-correlation. ABCC has been applied to the transient photocurrent signals generated by laser-excited photoionization of an organic test molecule in a polar solvent. It is demonstrated that the SNR is within a factor of two of gated integration and cross-correlation. These results are attained with the use of digital and analog signal processing and for flow-injection analysis with analog processing. System noise characteristics are studied to demonstrate the fact that the arrangement used is not, in fact, optimum owing to problems unique to photoconductive detection of the photoionization event. It is also demonstrated that rigorous timing of the detection circuitry is not required for optimum SNR with ABCC, allowing the elimination of relatively complex and expensive signal processing equipment.
Effect of water on oxidative scission of 1-butene to acetic acid over V2O5-TiO2 catalyst. Transient isotopic and kinetic study
 The role of water in the oxidation of 1-butene to AcOH over VOx-TiO2 was investigated using spectroscopic and transient isotopic exchange methods. It was shown that the influence of water strongly depended on the temperature of reaction. In particular, DRIFTS and NH3-TPD studies confirmed the temperature influence on the acidity and the amount of adsorbed water. XPS investigations suggested that not only oxygen from vanadia, but also from the lattice of titania was involved in the oxygen transfer during the reaction. Formation of oxidation products proceeded over two types of active vanadium oxide centers, i.e., VOH and VO. Hydrated vanadium species exhibited high selectivity towards AcOH formation. On the other hand, VO centers favored total oxidation. Kinetic model was developed for an unambiguous interpretation of the experimental results. Modelled reaction constants of the formation of AcOH over VOH centers were ca. 3.5 times higher than over VO centers. At the same time, the reaction rate constant of total oxidation in the presence of water was ca. 3.2 times lower than in dry flow. Estimated values suggested that in the presence of water the number of VOH centers was substantially lower than VO sites; however their contribution to the rate of AcOH formation was much higher.
Ultrastructural concomitants of anoxic injury and early post-anoxic recovery in rat optic nerve
 To study the effects of anoxia on CNS white matter, we examined the ultrastructure of axons and glial cells in a white matter tract, the rat optic nerve, that was subjected to a standardized anoxic insult in vitro. Previous electrophysiological studies showed that in this model, action potential conduction is rapidly abolished by anoxia, and conduction is restored after reoxygenation in about 30% of axons following a 60-min anoxic period. The present study examined the ultrastructural correlates of anoxic injury and early post-anoxic recovery in this model. Optic nerves examined immediately following 60 min of anoxia displayed numerous large, apparently empty zones located within myelin sheaths adjacent to the axon. The myelin remained compact and retained its periodicity. In some regions, the extracellular space was enlarged. There was mitochondrial swelling with loss of normal cristae. There was also loss of microtubules and, to a smaller degree, of neurofilaments in large-diameter axons. Some nodes of Ranvier in anoxic optic nerves displayed detachment of terminal oligodendroglial loops or retraction of the myelin from the node; the presence of tongue-like processes, extending from nearby cells under the detached myelin loops, suggested a possible role of cell-mediated damage to the paranodal myelin. Bundles of dense astrocyte processes were present, and there was vesicular degeneration of perinodal astrocyte processes. In optic nerves that had been permitted to recover for 60 min in oxygenated Ringers following the anoxic period, empty zones were only rarely observed within myelin sheaths and, when present, were smaller than in optic nerves immediately following 60 min of anoxia. The axoplasm of large fibers continued to show loss of microtubules and neurofilaments, as well as mitochondrial swelling. Myelin appeared normal, and only rare paranodal oligodendroglial processes remained unattached from the axon membrane. These results provide support for the idea that, during anoxia, myelinated axons are damaged with significant injury to cytoskeletal elements, probably due to an influx of calcium. The ultrastructural results, together with our earlier observations on the physiological correlates of anoxia and re-oxygenation, suggest that the development of intramyelinic spaces or damage to paranodes lead to conduction block in the anoxic optic nerve. These results also suggest that repair of these structural abnormalities may provide a morphological basis for the early recovery of conduction that occurs after re-oxygenation.
Intracellular alkalinization induces Ca2+ influx via non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in rat aortic smooth muscle cells
 In smooth muscle, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is the primary determinant of contraction, and the intracellular pH (pHi) modulates contractility. Using fura-2 and 2′,7′-biscarboxyethyl-5(6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) fluorometry and rat aortic smooth muscle cells in primary culture, we investigated the effect of the increase in pHi on [Ca2+]i. The application of the NH4Cl induced concentration-dependent increases in both pHi and [Ca2+]i. The extent of [Ca2+]i elevation induced by 20 mM NH4Cl was approximately 50% of that obtained with 100 mM K+-depolarization. The NH4Cl-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was completely abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ or the addition of extracellular Ni2+. The 100 mM K+-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was markedly inhibited by a voltage-operated Ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, and partly inhibited by a non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channel blocker, SKF96365. On the other hand, the NH4Cl-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was resistant to diltiazem, but was markedly inhibited by SKF96365. It is thus concluded that intracellular alkalinization activates the Ca2+ influx via non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and thereby increases [Ca2+]i in the vascular smooth muscle cells. The alkalinization-induced Ca2+ influx may therefore contribute to the enhancement of contraction.
Optical tomography hardware development for solid gas measurement using mixed projection
 The ability to implement fan beam projection in parallel view in an optical tomography setup is one of the novelties of this research. This design involves a sensor jig specifically designed for parallel applications that does not involve a collimator. Therefore, the fan beam projections can also be implemented in the same sensor jig without difficulty. This method is a very practical solution for overcoming the disadvantages of parallel beam projection. Although the fan beam has its own disadvantages, combining the fan beam approach with the parallel beam approach is expected to further enhance the optical tomography image quality. The image quality can be measured using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Normalized Mean-Square Error (NMSE) parameters. The combination of the two approaches also eliminates the unwanted noise that appears when using parallel beam projection alone.
EMC Measurements
 This chapter describes the equipment, the test methods, and some of the causes of error and uncertainty that attend electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing. For the ease of measurement and analysis, radiated emissions are assumed to predominate above 30MHz and conducted emissions are assumed to predominate below 30MHz. Emissions testing requires that the equipment under test is set up within a controlled electromagnetic environment under its normal operating conditions. The operating configuration is normally specified within emissions standards to be the one which maximizes emissions. For any RF emissions measurement, one needs a transducer to couple the measured variable into the input of the measuring instrumentation. Measured variables take one of three forms: (1) radiated electromagnetic field, (2) conducted cable voltage, and (3) conducted cable current. Radiated emissions compliance testing must be done on an open area test site. EMC measurements are inherently less accurate than other types of measurement. Radiated field susceptibility testing, in common with radiated emissions testing, suffers from considerable variability of results because of the physical conditions of the test setup.
Distributed optical fiber-based theoretical and empirical methods monitoring hydraulic engineering subjected to seepage velocity
 In order to systematically investigate the general principle and method of monitoring seepage velocity in the hydraulic engineering, the theoretical analysis and physical experiment were implemented based on distributed fiber-optic temperature sensing (DTS) technology. During the coupling influence analyses between seepage field and temperature field in the embankment dam or dike engineering, a simplified model was constructed to describe the coupling relationship of two fields. Different arrangement schemes of optical fiber and measuring approaches of temperature were applied on the model. The inversion analysis idea was further used. The theoretical method of monitoring seepage velocity in the hydraulic engineering was finally proposed. A new concept, namely the effective thermal conductivity, was proposed referring to the thermal conductivity coefficient in the transient hot-wire method. The influence of heat conduction and seepage could be well reflected by this new concept, which was proved to be a potential approach to develop an empirical method monitoring seepage velocity in the hydraulic engineering.
Fluctuations in nuclear envelope’s potential mediate synchronization of early neural activity
 Neural progenitor cells and developing neurons show periodic, synchronous Ca2+ rises even before synapse formation, and the origin of the synchronous activity remains unknown. Here, fluorescence measurement revealed that the membrane potential of the nuclear envelope, which forms an intracellular Ca2+ store, changed with a release of Ca2+ and generated spontaneous, periodic bursts of fluctuations in potential. Furthermore, changes in the nuclear envelope’s potential underlay spike burst generations. These results support the model that voltage fluctuations of the nuclear envelope synchronize Ca2+ release between cells and also function as a current noise generator to cause synchronous burst discharges.
Distributed temperature measurements using optical fibre technology in an underground mine environment
 This article experimentally examines the applicability of a temperature measuring and monitoring system using distributed temperature sensing by means of an optical fibre in an underground mine environment. The temperature distribution along an optical fibre can be detected by measuring the Raman backscattering of the stokes and anti-stokes lines. The distributed temperature sensing system provided valuable information for the mine safety control and the mine ventilation system. In addition, it proved to be capable of measuring air temperature in the entire mine with an accuracy of 1 °C and within the distance resolution of 1 m. The heating and cooling processes could be detected and the rate of heat generation at any location of the mine could be accurately determined from the temperature measurements. This technology has the potential to be linked to other measuring devices of an underground mine environment in order to develop a safer ventilation control system.
Cutaneous respirometry by dynamic measurement of mitochondrial oxygen tension for monitoring mitochondrial function in vivo
 Progress in diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction in chronic and acute disease could greatly benefit from techniques for monitoring of mitochondrial function in vivo. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo respirometry in skin. Mitochondrial oxygen measurements by means of oxygen-dependent delayed fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX are shown to provide a robust basis for measurement of local oxygen disappearance rate (ODR). The fundamental principles behind the technology are described, together with an analysis method for retrievel of respirometry data. The feasibility and reproducibility of this clinically useful approach are demonstrated in a series of rats.
Analysis of large area Trench-IGBT current distribution under UIS test with the aid of lock-in thermography
 In this contribution we focus on an innovative use of the well known lock-in thermography (LIT) technique. The main purpose of this paper is to show the possible use of the LIT technique in transient analysis of power devices. We show how the LIT technique can be used to image the current distribution in Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) tests and experimentally verify if current filamentation occurs. A significant number of experimental measurements on 1000 A peak current – 900 V maximum sustainable voltage Trench-IGBT is reported and discussed. The correlation between the sudden decrease in collector voltage during UIS test and filamentary current conduction inside the device has been demonstrated. Given the results of this analysis, an improved understanding of the reliability in UIS tests for the analyzed devices has been obtained confirming LIT technique as a useful tool for power devices analysis.
Electrostatic damage by detachment of protective film on polarizer
 LCD manufacturing processes are often exposed to the electrostatic hazards due to going through various optic film processes. In this paper, we report the electrostatic discharge failure that occurred during the detachment process of protective film to attach consecutive one on a panel. The effects of modified surface treatment on an adhesive layer of the protective film and the entry sequence of the stage to move the following process in the peeling process of protective film were analyzed. The difference of the respective surface properties of the protective film was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the electrostatic voltage measurements during a peeling process. The surface characterization of the film, when it is being rubbed and separated from main film, affects the amount and variation of electrostatic charge generation. Modified surface treatment of a protective film showed significant effect to reduce the failure rate and the maximum friction charge. And it was found that changing solely the entry sequence of the following stage with the modified protective film has a residual electrostatic problem. As a result, a main cause of the failure is considered that the variation of the capacitance between the panel and the stage when charges are generated during a peeling process.
The design of the residual ion dump power supply for ITER neutral beam injector
 The Residual Ion Dump Power Supply (RIDPS) is part of the Ground Related Power Supplies (GRPS) of the MITICA experiment of the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF) and the two ITER Heating Neutral Beam Injectors (HNBI). The GRPS will be manufactured by OCEM Energy Technology s.r.l. (OCEM) via a procurement contract with F4E. The RIDPS is devoted to feed the electrostatic Residual Ion Dump (RID), which deflects and collects the beam residual ions after the neutralization process. The maximum average voltage of the RIDPS is 25 kV, to which can be superimposed a sinusoidal or trapezoidal alternate voltage at 50 Hz, 5 kV maximum. The nominal current is 60 A, with a maximum pulse length of 1 h. This paper describes the detailed design of the RIDPS, highlighting its peculiar aspects, and the expected performance resulting from simulations.
Numerical prediction and neutron diffraction measurement of the residual stresses for a modified 9Cr–1Mo steel weld
 A modified 9Cr–1Mo steel provides extremely good mechanical properties at a high temperature when produced and heat treated, and thus the interest in the weld characteristics of a modified 9Cr–1Mo steel is increasing due to its potentiality for an application to modern power plants and advanced reactor systems. For the design and fabrication of stable welded structures, the effects of residual stress and deformation need to be estimated. The objective of this paper is to compare the measured residual stresses for modified 9Cr–1Mo steel welds induced by welding processes and the predicted residual stresses by a numerical simulation. The neutron diffraction technique is used to measure the residual stresses both on the surface and in the interior of a thickness for the welded specimens. A T-plate specimen and a V-butt specimen are prepared and their residual stresses are measured. A finite element model is employed to calculate the transient temperature and the residual stresses. The measured data and the simulation results are compared and the characteristics of a distribution of the residual stresses are discussed.
Health monitoring of composite structures by embedded FBG and interferometric Fabry–Pérot sensors
 In this study are proposed two different procedures for health monitoring of composite materials from the strain and the acoustic emission measurement. Two systems based on optic fibre sensors were developed based on a fibre Bragg grating and a Fabry–Pérot interferometer for strain and acoustic emission sensing. The sensors were embedded in the composite material providing real-time information about the host integrity.
Researches on Principles and Applications of Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry to Nondestructive Examination
 In recent years, With the high-speed development of electronic computer technology, optic-electronical technique and image processing technology, Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI for short) has become one of the most practical worthy techniques for speckle measuring methods. There are lots of advantages about it, such as uncomplicated operation, noncontacting, advanced automatic level, measurement on-line and extensive using. In this thesis, the physical quantity which directly reflects the situation of thermal deformation for the aluminum material can be obtained by using this method. Thus we can come to a conclusion that electronic speckle pattern interferometry is a new measuring method for extracting small-signal. It provides a powerfully theoretical and experimental platform for the study of automated, full-field and nondestructive measurement (NDE for short).
Calcium imaging in live rat optic nerve myelinated axons in vitro using confocal laser microscopy
 Intracellular Ca2+ plays a major role in the physiological responses of excitable cells, and excessive accumulation of internal Ca2+ is a key determinant of cell injury and death. Many studies have been carried out on the internal Ca2+ dynamics in neurons. In constrast, there is virtually no such information for mammalian central myelinated axons, due in large part to technical difficulty with dye loading and imaging such fine myelinated structures. We developed a technique to allow imaging of ionized Ca2+ in live rat optic nerve axons with simultaneous electrophysiological recording in vitro at 37°C using confocal microscopy. The K+ salt of the Ca2+-sensitive indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-2 and the Ca2+-insensitive reference dye Sulforhodamine 101 were loaded together into rat optic nerves using a low-Ca2+/low-Na+ solution. Axonal profiles, confirmed immunohistochemically by double staining with neurofilament-160 antibodies, were clearly visualized by S101 fluorescence up to 800 μm from the cut ends. The Ca2+ signal was very low at rest, just above the background fluorescence intensity, indicating healthy tissue, and increased significantly after caffeine (20 mM) exposure designed to release internal Ca2+ stores. The health of imaged regions was further confirmed by a virtual absence of spectrin breakdown, which is induced by calpain activation in damaged CNS tissue. Red and green fluorescence decayed to no less than 70% of control after 60 min of recording at 37°C, with the green:red fluorescence ratio increasing slightly by 21% after 60 min. Electrophysiological responses recorded simultaneously with confocal images remained largely stable as well.
Spectral diffusion in organic glasses. Temperature dependence of permanent and transient holes
 Spectral diffusion of the S1←S0 0—0 transition (Qy) of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) as guest in the glasses ethanol (EtOH), triethylamine (TEA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and diethylether at low temperature has been studied by transient and permanent hole burning with a single-mode GaAlAs diode laser at ≈ 780 nm. Transient holes decay on a time scale of about 100 ms, determined by the triplet-state lifetime of BChl a. Their widths are compared to those of permanent holes probed on a time scale of minutes; both follow a T1.3±0.1 temperature dependence between 1.2 and 4.2 K and extrapolate to the fluorescence lifetime-limited value for T→0. The amount of spectral diffusion, derived from the difference in width of permanent and transient holes over a time span between ≈ 10−5 and ≈102 s, strongly depends on the glassy host.
Visual evoked responses in cats with optic tract lesions
 Some electrophysiological consequences of lesions destroying 80% or more of the optic tract were studied in nine cats with chronically implanted electrodes, the visual capacities of which have previously been described. Lesions sparing as little as 5–10% of the optic tract left the photically-elicited averaged response recorded from central visual projection sites unaffected or only minimally attenuated, as compared to prelesion response. Larger subtotal lesions greatly attenuated and distorted the potentials, and total transection of the optic tract abolished them entirely Recordings from sites distal to the lesion showed that the input from the retina was not affected by the lesions. Responses elicited by electrical stimulation of the optic tract distal to the lesion were somewhat more affected than the photic responses. Barbiturate anesthesia had no differential effect on the electrophysiological consequences of the lesions.
Functional and structural correlates of magnetic resonance patterns in a new in vitro model of cerebral ischemia by transient occlusion of the medial cerebral artery
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the acute phase of a stroke contributes to recognize ischemic regions and is potentially useful to predict clinical outcome. Yet, the functional significance of early MRI alterations during brain ischemia is not clearly understood. We achieved an experimental study to interpret MRI signals in a novel model of focal ischemia in the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain. By combining neurophysiological and morphological analysis with MR-imaging, we evaluated the suitability of MR to identify ischemic and peri-ischemic regions. Extracellular recordings demonstrated depolarizations in the ischemic core, but not in adjacent areas, where evoked activity was preserved and brief peri-infarct depolarizations occurred. Diffusion-weighted MRI and immunostaining performed after neurophysiological characterization showed changes restricted to the core region. Diffusion-weighted MR alterations did not include the penumbra region characterized by peri-infarct depolarizations. Therefore, by comparing neurophysiological, imaging and anatomical data, we can conclude that DW-MRI underestimates the extension of the tissue damage involved in brain ischemia.
Electrooptic measurement of the volume resistivity of bismuth silicon oxide (Bi12SiO20)
 Single crystals of bismuth silicon oxide (Bi12SiO20) and its isomorphs (including, for example, bismuth germanium oxide (Bi12GeO20)) have been utilized in a wide range of active electrooptic and acoustoopic devices, including the Pockels Readout Optical Modulator (PROM), the PRIZ, the Photorefractive Incoherent-to-Coherent Optical Converter (PICOC), volume holographic storage devices, and surface acoustic wave devices. A key material parameter that influences device performance characteristics is the volume resistivity, which is difficult to measure accurately using standard techniques in refractory oxides like Bi12SiO20 due to its large magnitude (typically 1013ω cm). We present here a technique for the measurement of such very high resistivities in electrooptic materials; this method utilizes the electrooptic modulation induced by a voltage placed across the (crystallographically oriented) sample as a probe of temporal voltage transients that are in turn directly related to the sample volume resistivity. In our experiments, a very weak optical probe is frequency modulated, phase detected, and employed at low duty cycle to avoid ambiguities due to photoconductive voltage decay. The technique is described in detail, and experimental results are presented on a number of undoped and doped samples of bismuth silicon oxide grown by the Czochralski technique.
Bipolar photogenerated terahertz radiation in biased photoconductive switches
 The characteristics of optically induced bipolar THz radiation in biased photoconductive switches were investigated systematically by using free-space electro-optic sampling technique. The emitted radiation shows nearly symmetrical waveform with broadband frequency spectrum spanning over 0.1–3 THz. It was observed that the bipolar nature and the emitted frequency spectrum distribution remained unchanged on varying the optical excitation fluence, strength of biased field and the emitter gap spacing. The dynamics of emitted THz transient are in agreement with the optically induced ultrafast charge transport process driven by the biased field.
Evidence for deviations from a single-exponential distribution of conduction band tail states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon: A transient photocurrent analysis
 We employ transient photocurrent decay measurements to determine the distribution of conduction band tail states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon. It is found that these experimental results suggest the possibility of deviations from a single-exponential functional form. This is consistent with other more recent experimental determinations of the distribution of conduction band tail states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon.
Chapter 6 Photothermal Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy of Impurities and Defects in Semiconductors
 This chapter summarizes the potential for photothermal radiometry (PTR), in conjunction with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), to be used as a noncontact technique. The physical principles of this technique are presented first, along with the preliminary results obtained with silicon and gallium arsenide. The instrument setup and experimental characteristics of PTR-DLTS regarding the free-carrier plasma and the lattice thermal transport origin of the signal are presented. Rate-window detection using either a lock-in-amplifier or a boxcar integrator scheme has been evaluated with silicon wafers. The prospects are excellent for this novel technique to be developed to a remote fully noncontact diagnostic tool for real-time in situ characterization. Motivated by powerful considerations in favor of noncontacting DLTS techniques, in this chapter the development and the first few exploratory applications of a novel all-optical, improved methodology, called infrared photothermal radiometric deep-level transient spectroscopy (PTR-DLTS), are described, and its potential for ion-implantation defect diagnostics discussed.
Molecular tilting effect on Smectic liquid crystal sub-phase stability from its retardation switching behavior
 Molecular tilting effect to the Smectic layer normal at Smectic C phase liquid crystal is investigated in terms of its retardation switching effect. This investigation clarified that in some specific initial molecular alignment case, Smectic C phase liquid crystal molecular behavior has in-plane only movement, resulting in almost complete suppression of out-of-plane retardation switching. Such behavior indicates that Smectic layer stability is also conceivable with initial surface anchoring influence in terms of artificial influence of surface anchoring to govern tilted Smectic liquid crystal molecular movement behavior. Possible control in in-plane only retardation switching would provide new phase modulation devices.
On interdependence among transmit and consumed power of macro base station technologies
 Dynamic adaptation of the base stations on/off activity or transmit power, according to space and time traffic variations, are measures accepted in the most contemporary resource management approaches dedicated to improving energy efficiency of cellular access networks. Practical implementation of both measures results in changes to instantaneous base station power consumption. In this paper, extensive analyses presenting influence of the transmit power scaling and on/off switching on instantaneous macro base stations power consumption are given. Based on real on-site measurements performed on a set of macro base stations of different access technologies and production years, we developed linear power consumption models. These models are developed by means of linear regression and precisely model the influence of transmit power on instantaneous power consumption for the second, third and fourth generations of macro base stations. In order to estimate the potential energy savings of transmit power scaling and on/off switching for base stations of different generations, statistical analyses of measured power consumptions are performed. Also, transient times and variations of base stations instantaneous power consumption during transient periods initiated with on/off switching and transmit power scaling are presented. Since the developed power consumption models have huge confidence follow measured results, they can be used as general models for expressing the relationship between transmitted and consumed power for macro base stations of different technologies and generations.
Voltage-clamp analysis of muscarinic excitation in hippocampal neurons
 Pyramidal cells in the CA1 field of guinea pig hippocampal slices were voltage-clamped using a single microelectrode, at 23–30°C. Small inwardly relaxing currents triggered by step hyperpolarizations from holding potentials of −80 to −40 mV were investigated. Inward relaxations occurring for negative steps between −40 mV and − 70 mV resembled M-currents of sympathetic ganglion cells: they were abolished by addition of carbachol, muscarine or bethanechol, as well as by 1 mM barium; the relaxations appeared to invert at around −80 mV; they became faster at more negative potentials; and the inversion potential was shifted positively by raising external K+ concentration. Inward relaxations triggered by steps negative to −80 mV, in contrast, appeared to reflect passage of another current species, which has been labelled IQ.Thus IQ did not invert negative to −80 mV, it was insensitive to muscarinic agonists or to barium, and it was blocked by 0.5–3 mM cesium (which does not block IM). Turn-on of IQ causes the well known droop in the hyperpolarizing electrtonic potential in these cells. The combined effects of IQ and IM make the steady-state current-voltage relation of CA1 cells slightly sigmoidal around rest potential. It is suggested that activation of cholinergic septal inputs to the hippocampus facilitates repetitive firing off pyramidal cells by turning off the M-conductance, without much change in the resting potential of the cell.
Rapid measurements and mapping of tracer gas concentrations in a large indoor space
 Rapid mapping of gas concentrations in air benefits studies of atmospheric phenomena ranging from pollutant dispersion to surface layer meteorology. Here we demonstrate a technique that combines multiple-open-path tunable-diode-laser spectroscopy and computed tomography to map tracer gas concentrations with approximately 0.5 m spatial and 7 s temporal resolution. Releasing CH4 as a tracer gas in a large (7 m×9 m×11 m high) ventilated chamber, we measured path-integrated CH4 concentrations over a planar array of 28 “long” (2–10 m) optical paths, recording a complete sequence of measurements every 7 s during the course of hour-long experiments. Maps of CH4 concentration were reconstructed from the long path data using a computed tomography algorithm that employed simulated annealing to search for a best fit solution. The reconstructed maps were compared with simultaneous measurements from 28 “short” (0.5 m) optical paths located in the same measurement plane. On average, the reconstructed maps capture ∼74% of the variance in the short path measurements. The accuracy of the reconstructed maps is limited, in large part, by the number of optical paths and the time required for the measurement. Straightforward enhancements to the instrumentation will allow rapid mapping of three-dimensional gas concentrations in indoor and outdoor air, with sub-second temporal resolution.
Resonance fluorescence during phase-controlled transient excitation
 The response of a two-level atom to a resonant driving field can be dramatically altered by a sudden shift in the driving field's phase. We discuss the implications of this fact with respect to the atom's transient fluorescence spectrum and relaxation properties.
Intracellular calcium transients from newborn rat cardiomyocytes in primary culture
 Resting and transient levels of intracellular free calcium concentrations were recorded in indo-1 loaded neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in primary culture by means of an interative laser cytometer. The calcium transients were induced by high potassium and caffeine applications. The resting level of intracellular calcium remained constant (about 140 nM) throughout the culture (up to 7 days). The calcium transients induced by 100 mM K+ changed during culture from a low, cobalt sensitive response at 2 days, to a strong biphasic response at 7 days. At 2 days the response was fully blocked by cobalt. At 7 days the transient phase was abolished by cobalt and ryanodine, whereas the second sustained phase was only partially blocked. The calcium transient induced by caffeine was present as early as the first days, and increased with the age of the culture. This transient was blocked by ryanodine. The calcium influx through sarcolemmal calcium channels could be responsible for intracellular calcium transients in 2 day-old cells, whereas in 7 day-old cells, they seem to be only the trigger for sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release via a mechanism such as ‘calcium-induced calcium-release’. Other mechanisms, such as the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism activated by sarcolemmal depolarisation, seem to be implicated too and therefore could explain the sustained level of intracellular calcium during 100 mM K+ stimulation. The developmental changes through differentiation and maturation of myocytes in culture could account for the age dependent evolution of the responses obtained. From these results it is possible to conclude that calcium movements implicated in the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism in the development of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes are similar in primary culture and in the postnatal period in vivo.
Electro-optic coefficient determination in stratified organized molecular thin films: application to poled polymers
 We describe a method which enables us to determine the linear and quadratic electro-optic coefficients (real and imaginary parts) of thin stratified films even inside the absorption range. The principle is based on the interferences between the electric-field-induced modulation of the transverse electric and transverse magnetic reflected waves. Experiments performed on a poled polymer yield microscopic parameters such as the excited and fundamental state permanent moments and the difference and transition moments which are in a very good agreement with other determinations. The presence of an excited state not detected by linear spectroscopy was revealed.
Transient electric birefringence study of rod-like triple-helical polysaccharide schizophyllan
 The rotational dynamics of the uncharged, triple-helical polysaccharide schizophyllan was determined by transient electric birefingence. The field-free decay of a sample with weight average molecular weight of 437× 103gmol−1 deviated from single-exponential behaviour. The relaxation spectra obtained by analysis using the CONTIN program, were bimodal, whereas analysis by the stretched exponentials also accounted well for the field-free decay of the birefringence of the polydisperse sample. The mean rotational relaxation time extrapolated to infinite pulse duration of the orienting pulse for dilute aqueous solution of the 437×103gmol−1 sample was determined equal to 61 μs. Analysis of the influence of chain rigidity on the rotational dynamics of the polydisperse sample indicated that the persistence length, Lpe, was 70nm.
Advances in temperature measurement
 The need for temperature measurement is ever present in science and industry from requirements for monitoring processes, in the management of quality control and research. Temperature can be measured by means of direct contact between the medium of interest and the measuring device or by remote observation of a temperature-dependent parameter. The range of devices with which temperature can be measured is extensive, not surprisingly because most physical parameters exhibit a dependency on temperature. In recent years the dominant position of liquid-in-glass and bimetallic thermometers, thermocouples, and resistant temperature detectors has been challenged as the common choice for temperature measurement by infrared thermometers and an increasing array of other noninvasive techniques. This chapter outlines the principal techniques available for the measurement of temperature, describing the physical phenomena exploited, the temperature range of use, equipment required, and typical applications. Recent trends in requirements for traceability and quantification of uncertainty, as well as developments in the areas of instrumentation capability and technique, are described.
Application of wireless electrical non-fiberoptic endoscope: Potential benefit and limitation in endoscopic surgery
 Conventional rigid endoscope requires a bundle of optic fibers for illumination and a set of camera for viewing body cavity. The design is bulky in the hand-held part and the laterally positioned optic fibers may hinder manipulation of instruments, especially in single port surgery. We designed a simplified unit to replace conventional endoscope. We used an independent front image sensor along with six light emitting diode crystals. A wireless module working in 2.4 GHz and its antenna were integrated into the hand-help part. Two 800 mA batteries were used for power supply. The study was tested in two 35 kg pigs. Some simple thoracoscopic and laparoscopic operations were simulated to test the reliability and surgeon's acceptability. Signal Noise ratio can be controlled well in the setting of the operative room. Signal transmission was influenced significantly when covered by damped gauze or drape. The best quality of wireless transmission is through line-of-sight. Dropping frame is less than 1 frame per second in 99% time period during the test. Wireless modules in the design of rigid endoscope may be a plausible option with good acceptability.
An apparatus for measurement of electrically induced birefringence, linear dichroism, and optical rotation of macromolecular solutions and suspensions
 Measurements of the transient response of various optical properties to applied pulsed electric fields are becoming popular in the study of macromolecular solutions. A single apparatus is described which can be used to measure changes in each of the three electro-optic properties indicated in the title of the paper. A major feature of the apparatus is the design and construction of cells which enable one to apply the field either perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to, or parallel and comittant (i.e., longitudinal) with the light beam as it passes through the solution. With the transverse cell, birefringence and dichroism measurements are made. The longitudinal cell and apparatus has enabled us to make the first ever electrically induced transient longitudinal dichrosim and transient optical rotation changes for macromolecular solutions. The design and assembly of the apparatus is given and typical measurements are described. The birefringence of aqueous bentonite and helical polybenzyl glutamate, the linear dischroism of the helical amylose tri-iodide complex and the optical rotation changes of helical polybenzyl glutamate all gave results in excellent agreement with values in the literature.
Brain NADH redox state monitored in vivo by fiber optic surface fluorometry
 A new approach for the evaluation of brain energy metabolism in awake animals became possible as UV transmitting optical fibers became available. A variety of surface fiber optic fluorometers/reflectometers which were developed during the past decade enabled the monitoring of intramitochondrial NADH redox state in unanesthetized animals. The bundle of flexible fibers was connected to the brain via a cemented light guide holder implanted epidurally. The two signals obtained, 366 nm reflectance and 450 nm fluorescence, are subjected to various artifacts not connected to the intramitochondrial NADH redox state. In our system, the effects of movement artifacts and changes in blood oxygenation are negligible while the effects of tissue absorption or blood volume changes are considerable and could be minimized by subtraction of the two signals (1:1 ratio) providing the corrected fluorescence signal. The brain was exposed to various physiologcal and pathological conditions which resulted in the increase or decrease in the level of NADH. Under anoxia, hypoxia and ischemia, oxygen availability decreased and the metabolic state of the brain became more reduced (state 4–5 transition). When the brain was activated by seizures, spreading depression of hyperbaric oxygenation NADH became more oxidized (state 4-3 transition).
Electronic drivers/TIAs for optical interconnects
 High-speed electronic circuits are crucial to the success of optical interconnects. This Chapter focuses on the driver electronics in the transmitter and the transimpedance amplifier in the receiver. These critical circuits need to be closely integrated and co-designed with the electro-optic and opto-electronic devices such as VCSELs and photodiodes. The most practical modulation schemes for optical interconnects are also discussed and the basic driver and transimpedance amplifier circuit architectures are introduced together with some state-of-the-art research results.
Compressible gas gills of diving insects: Measurements and models
 Many diving insects collect a bubble of air from the surface to supply their oxygen requirements while submerged. It has been theorised that these air bubbles may also act as compressible gas gills, as the low oxygen partial pressure (PO2) within the bubble caused by the insect's respiration creates a gradient capable of driving the diffusion of oxygen from the water into the bubble. Under these conditions nitrogen diffuses in the opposite direction, resulting in a situation where the volume of the bubble is continually shrinking while oxygen is obtained. This study measures changes in volume and PO2 within the gas gills held by a tethered water bug, Agraptocorixa eurynome. Both gill volume and PO2 drop rapidly at the beginning of a dive, but eventually the PO2 reaches an apparently stable level while volume continually declines at a slower rate. Active ventilation of the gill is crucial to maintaining oxygen uptake. These measurements are used to calculate oxygen flux into the gas gill and the oxygen consumption rate (V˙O2) of the bug. The effectiveness of a gas gill as a respiratory organ is also demonstrated by determining the critical PO2 of the water bug and comparing this with measured gas gill PO2 and calculated V˙O2.
TMEM126A is a mitochondrial located mRNA (MLR) protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane
 Hereditary optic neuropathies (HONs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that affect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and axons that form the optic nerve. Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and the autosomal dominant optic atrophy related to OPA1 mutations are the most common forms. Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive optic neuropathies are rare and their existence has been long debated. We recently identified the first gene responsible for these conditions, TMEM126A. This gene is highly expressed in retinal cellular compartments enriched in mitochondria and supposed to encode a mitochondrial transmembrane protein of unknown function. A specific polyclonal antibody targeting the TMEM126A protein has been generated. Quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization, cellular fractionation, mitochondrial membrane association study, mitochondrial sub compartmentalization analysis by both proteolysis assays and transmission electron microscopy, and expression analysis of truncated TMEM126A constructs by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy were carried out. TMEM126A mRNAs are strongly enriched in the vicinity of mitochondria and encode an inner mitochondrial membrane associated cristae protein. Moreover, the second transmembrane domain of TMEM126A is required for its mitochondrial localization. TMEM126A is a mitochondrial located mRNA (MLR) that may be translated in the mitochondrial surface and the protein is subsequently imported to the inner membrane. These data constitute the first step toward a better understanding of the mechanism of action of TMEM126A in RGCs and support the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HON. Local translation of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial mRNAs might be a mechanism for rapid onsite supply of mitochondrial membrane proteins.
Programmable logic design of a compact Genetic Algorithm for phasor estimation in real-time
 The main objective of this work is to present an efficient method for phasor estimation based on a compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA) implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). To validate the proposed method, an Electrical Power System (EPS) simulated by the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) provides data to be used by the cGA. This data is as close as possible to the actual data provided by the EPS. Real life situations such as islanding, sudden load increase and permanent faults were considered. The implementation aims to take advantage of the inherent parallelism in Genetic Algorithms in a compact and optimized way, making them an attractive option for practical applications in real-time estimations concerning Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs).
Photocarrier transport in iron-doped potassium lithium tantalate niobate studied by time-of-flight measurement
 The photocarrier mobility of Fe 0.03 wt%-doped potassium lithium tantalate niobate (K0.95Li0.05Ta0.61Nb0.39O3) was investigated by time-of-flight (TOF) measurement. The longitudinal photocarrier response due to pulsed excitation leads to values of the drift mobility of μh = 1.45 × 10−2 cm2/V s for holes, μe = 0.325 × 10−2 cm2/V s for electrons, and a value for the range of holes (μτ)h = 4.38 × 10−5 cm2/V at room temperature and at low field 3 KV/cm. The response time of holes and electrons (or the relaxation time) is determined to be 3.02 × 10−3 s and 3.74 × 10−3 s, respectively. The mobility of holes strongly depends on the field strength, and is observed to decrease with increasing bias field.
Measurement of thermal properties of microfluidic samples using laser point heating thermometry
 This work introduces a novel method to measure the thermal conductivity, diffusivity, and heat capacity of a microfluidic sample having a small-volume of the order of 1 μl. The method is based on a new concept named laser point heating thermometry (LPHT). The method employs point heating of a thermocouple tip using a focused laser beam. As the suggested scheme utilizes external optical heating of a temperature probe, a relatively large amount of heat can be generated at a localized spot. Furthermore, the temperature of the heated spot can be effectively monitored from thermoelectric potential without undesirable electrical interference in the heating and sensing circuitry. In addition to the thermal-property measurement, this simultaneous point heating and point sensing technique can be employed in a variety of thermal-sensing applications including velocity and motion measurement.
Electro-optic studies of polarisation processes in aqueous macromolecular solutions and colloid suspensions
 A brief description is given of the electric birefringence and electric light scattering methods for characterising macromolecules in dilute solution. Whereas these methods have not been extended over the wide frequency range of dielectric measurements, they can be used to study aqueous solutions and suspensions in direct current fields. Representative data are collated which indicate (i) the significant role that the particle surface plays in the electrical polarisation of the medium and (ii) the high sensitivity of electro-optic methods to this interface. The methods not only offer an experimental approach to the study of the electric double layer and the stability of particles in suspension but also provide a means of following the interaction of both small and large molecules with macromolecules in solution. Mention is also made as to how the atomic polarisability can be discretely isolated from the total polarisability, by using the recently developed method of laser induced birefringence.
Oligodendroglial NMDA Receptors Regulate Glucose Import and Axonal Energy Metabolism
 Oligodendrocytes make myelin and support axons metabolically with lactate. However, it is unknown how glucose utilization and glycolysis are adapted to the different axonal energy demands. Spiking axons release glutamate and oligodendrocytes express NMDA receptors of unknown function. Here we show that the stimulation of oligodendroglial NMDA receptors mobilizes glucose transporter GLUT1, leading to its incorporation into the myelin compartment in vivo. When myelinated optic nerves from conditional NMDA receptor mutants are challenged with transient oxygen-glucose deprivation, they show a reduced functional recovery when returned to oxygen-glucose but are indistinguishable from wild-type when provided with oxygen-lactate. Moreover, the functional integrity of isolated optic nerves, which are electrically silent, is extended by preincubation with NMDA, mimicking axonal activity, and shortened by NMDA receptor blockers. This reveals a novel aspect of neuronal energy metabolism in which activity-dependent glutamate release enhances oligodendroglial glucose uptake and glycolytic support of fast spiking axons.
Dense gas–liquid–solid flow in a slurry bubble column: Measurements of dynamic characteristics, gas volume fraction and bubble size distribution
 Dense three-phase slurry flows are important in several industrial processes (e.g., Methanol/ DME synthesis, Fischer Tropsch synthesis). In the present work, gas–liquid–solid flow in a pseudo 3D slurry bubble column is characterized under dense flow conditions for superficial gas velocity (UG) of 5–30 cms-1 and overall solid loading (αS) of 0–40 vol.%. In-house developed voidage probes were used to measure local gas volume fraction fluctuations. The high frequency fluctuations (∼1–10 Hz) caused by individual bubbles or swarms of bubbles were found to increase with increase in αS and UG. The low frequency oscillations (∼< 1 Hz) corresponding to column-scale recirculating flow were found to decrease with increase in αS. Importantly, time-averaged gas volume fraction and its internal composition (i.e. gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups) and bubble size distribution were measured at different locations in the slurry bubble column. With an increase in αS, local gas volume fraction was found to decrease, accompanied by an increase in bubble size. Based on the distribution of bubble chord lengths, the gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups was measured for different αS and UG. With increase in αS, the gas volume fraction for small bubbles was found to decrease while that for large bubbles was found to increase. Under the dense flow conditions (at high UG and αS), while small bubbles were found to accumulate near the column walls, as indicated by the wall peaking in α‾G profiles, large bubbles/gas slugs were found to flow predominantly through the column center. In addition to the new experimental data, the present work helps to improve the understanding of dense slurry flows that will aid the development and verification of Eulerian multiphase models.
Picosecond transient Raman spectroscopy of excited-state dynamics
 An apparatus is described which generates very sensitive picosecond transient Raman spectra with 5 ps time resolution. The fast repetition rate high peak power picosecond pulses necessary to detect weak Raman scattering were obtained using a copper vapor laser to amplify synchronously pumped dye laser pulses. Transient vibrational spectra obtained by this technique have been used to investigate the excited-state photophysics of substituted diphenylethylenes.
Design of an optical thermal sensor for proton exchange membrane fuel cell temperature measurement using phosphor thermometry
 Internal temperatures in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell govern the ionic conductivities of the polymer electrolyte, influence the reaction rate at the electrodes, and control the water vapor pressure inside the cell. It is vital to fully understand thermal behavior in a PEM fuel cell if performance and durability are to be optimized. The objective of this research was to design, construct, and implement thermal sensors based on the principles of the lifetime-decay method of phosphor thermometry to measure temperatures inside a PEM fuel cell. Five sensors were designed and calibrated with a maximum uncertainty of ±0.6 °C. Using these sensors, surface temperatures were measured on the cathode gas diffusion layer of a 25 cm2 PEM fuel cell. The test results demonstrate the utility of the optical temperature sensor design and provide insight into the thermal behavior found in a PEM fuel cell.
Transient cavitation and associated mechanisms of stone disintegration
 The actual interaction mechanisms of stress shock waves with renal calculi or gall bladder stones during disintegration, noninvasively, are still not understood clearly. The high-pressure shock waves create transient cavitation that is accepted as one behind the mechanisms of disintegration of those stones. The cavitation phenomenon and other associated mechanisms responsible for the disintegration are reviewed here. The theoretical aspects of shock waves, ultrasonic stress waves and their relation to the resulting fractures of the stones are also discussed. The results, mainly based on the earlier findings, are analysed and discussed to investigate the actual mechanisms involved in stone disintegration. Some mechanisms, such as shock wave impact and seismic effect, micro-streaming, microjets and cavitation, are considered in detail. Other factors like fracture strength, ultrasonic propagation, focal shock energy, thermal effects, erosion, medium viscosity and fissures, etc., in relation to stone disintegration, are also briefly discussed. The techniques for the enhancement of bubble formation and bubble implosion to accelerate the fragmentation process are proposed. It is hoped that the proposed study would help in the design of better lithotripters with an improved disintegration efficiency.
High speed speckle interferometry for experimental analysis of dynamic phenomena
 In this paper we present a high speed speckle interferometry system for the experimental analysis of transient and dynamic phenomena. The system is based on an out-of-plane continuous wave speckle interferometry setup and integrates a fast camera that allows acquisition rates of over 26,000 frames/s in a reduced window (160×60 pixels). We obtain thus series of temporally sampled, full spatial data fields of surface deformation during a given time interval. The data processing algorithms may concern 2D data fields or one-dimensional temporal histories of individual pixels.
Linagliptin improved myocardial function recovery in rat hearts after a prolonged hypothermic preservation
 To determine whether linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, can promote the recovery of cardiac function after hypothermic preservation. Rat hearts were preserved in cold Celsior solution with or without linagliptin for 9 h. Cardiac function was evaluated at 60 min of reperfusion after hypothermic preservation. Cardiac mitochondrial morphology was observed using transmission electron microscope. The expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were detected using Western blot. Compared with Celsior group, supplement of Celsior solution with linagliptin (0.25–0.75 nM) could significantly prevent hypothermic preservation-induced cardiac dysfunction. The expression of NOX2 protein, ROS level and MDA content in cardium were increased after hypothermic preservation, which was inhibited by linagliptin. Although the mitofusin1, 2, optic atrophy type 1, and total Drp1 expression in myocardium did not change, the level of p-Drp1 S616 and mitochondrial Drp1 were enhanced after hypothermic preservation. Linagliptin supplement could inhibit the hypothermic preservation-induced increase in p-Drp1 S616 and mitochondrial Drp1 protein, and mitigate the mitochondrial fragmentation. Level of p-CaMKII protein enhanced after hypothermic preservation, which could be prevented by linagliptin or a NOX2 inhibitor Phox-I2. Both Phox-I2 and a CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 could reduce the hypothermic preservation-induced increase in p-Drp1 S616 and mitochondrial Drp1 protein. Supplement Celsior solution with linagliptin could improve cardiac function recovery in 9-h hypothermic preserved rat hearts. The cardioprotective effect of linagliptin might be due to the inhibition of Drp1 phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation by preventing NOX2-mediated CaMKII activation.
Postprandial Transient Visual Loss
 Purpose: The authors report the association of transient visual loss after eating meals with severe carotid occlusive disease, and propose a hypothesis for its pathophysiology. Methods: Description of clinical history and examination, radiologic and other studies in two patients with postprandial transient visual loss, and review of the literature for three related cases. Results: Two women, 59 and 65 years of age, presented with splotchy visual loss lasting up to more than 1 hour in the left and both eyes, respectively. In both patients, the visual loss was precipitated by eating a meal. Radiologic investigations revealed 90% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery in the first patient and occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and 40% to 70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery in the second patient. Conclusions: Visual loss after eating a meal may result from hypoperfusion of the retinal and choroidal circulations and is suggestive of severe carotid occlusive disease.
Comparison of PIV and PDA droplet velocity measurement techniques on two high-pressure water mist nozzles
 The need for reliable measurement of droplet velocities and droplet size has increased with the more widespread use of water mist systems. Two optical measuring techniques have been investigated, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and phase Doppler anemometry (PDA). Measurements have been performed on two high-pressure nozzles, a hollow cone nozzle and a full cone nozzle. Both methods performed well close to the nozzle and further away from the nozzle. In the intermediate region the results obtained with PIV are biased against the larger droplets. The two methods complement each other, PIV giving the instantaneous velocity field and PDA giving both the droplet velocity and droplet size at a point. The measurement indicates that higher throw length can be archived with a full cone nozzle compared to the hollow cone nozzle, if both nozzles have the same cone angle and flow rate.
High-voltage testing of superconducting power apparatus1
 Superconducting power apparatus for commercial and utility applications must pass the same high-voltage tests required by national standards for conventional equipment. Various considerations which enter into development of high-voltage test procedures are summarized, and brief descriptions of the equipment and procedures used for common high-voltage tests are given. Actual high-voltage tests performed during several superconducting equipment development projects are summarized to illustrate the principles.
Time-resolved analysis of self-heating in power VDMOSFETs using backside laserprobing
 A laserprobe technique for characterization of transient self-heating in power devices is proposed and its applicability is demonstrated on VDMOSFETs. The change in the silicon lattice temperature in the device active region under pulsed operation is sensed by an infrared laser beam focused on a single VDMOS cell from the substrate side. The temperature-induced change in the silicon refractive index causes an optical phase change which is detected interferometrically. The transient phase measurements are carried out under various VDMOSFET bias conditions and for heating pulse widths in the μs range. The laser beam modulation is numerically modeled using a solution of the transient heat transport equation and a transmission line approach to model the beam propagation. Calculated optical phase signals show a very good agreement with the experiments. The phase change calculated by using a simple geometric optic approximation was compared with the phase variation obtained by the rigorous transmission line approach. The results show that the geometric optic approach can accurately be used in the analysis of transient self-heating of VDMOSFETs.
Sodium Channel SCN3A (NaV1.3) Regulation of Human Cerebral Cortical Folding and Oral Motor Development
 Channelopathies are disorders caused by abnormal ion channel function in differentiated excitable tissues. We discovered a unique neurodevelopmental channelopathy resulting from pathogenic variants in SCN3A, a gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.3. Pathogenic NaV1.3 channels showed altered biophysical properties including increased persistent current. Remarkably, affected individuals showed disrupted folding (polymicrogyria) of the perisylvian cortex of the brain but did not typically exhibit epilepsy; they presented with prominent speech and oral motor dysfunction, implicating SCN3A in prenatal development of human cortical language areas. The development of this disorder parallels SCN3A expression, which we observed to be highest early in fetal cortical development in progenitor cells of the outer subventricular zone and cortical plate neurons and decreased postnatally, when SCN1A (NaV1.1) expression increased. Disrupted cerebral cortical folding and neuronal migration were recapitulated in ferrets expressing the mutant channel, underscoring the unexpected role of SCN3A in progenitor cells and migrating neurons.
An experimental optimization study for concentration and laser power effects in the fullerene-C60 and azo dye doped guest–host liquid crystal systems
 The current–voltage characteristics of a famous guest–host liquid crystal system have been investigated under dark and laser illumination conditions. Dependency of current modulation with respect to concentration and laser power gives some optimization possibilities and estimations on the reorientation mechanisms of the liquid crystals. The current–voltage character of pure E7 is almost unchanged with laser pumping, while the fullerene and dye doping are enhancing effects in their individual and collective usage. The negative resistance effect was observed for some certain concentrations of the dye and C60, and this peculiarity is shown to be switched with laser illumination. The mobility of the doped LC samples was calculated by transient current measurements and its dependency on the dye concentration and the laser power was investigated. It is evaluated that the effect of methyl red is a critical parameter in photoconductivity applications of liquid crystals.
Photostimulation with caged neurotransmitters using fiber optic lightguides
 `Caged' neurotransmitters are molecules that are transformed to a neuroactive state by exposure to light of an appropriate wavelength and intensity. Use of these substances has centered on in vitro bath application and subsequent activation using light from lasers or flashlamps that is delivered into the preparation through microscope optics. We have tested a new and simpler method, using finely tapered fiberoptic lightguides, that promises to expand the use of caged compounds for in vitro and in vivo experimentation. We demonstrated the feasibility and flexibility of this method for caged neurotransmitter delivery using a range of ex vitro, in vitro and in vivo approaches. The degree and timing of uncaging could be controlled by manipulating the wavelength, intensity and timing of the light projected into the optical fiber. Because of the small size of the light guide and the ability to control light exposure at the source, this new method promises greater control over the spatial and temporal delivery of neuroactive substances than simple bath or iontophoretic application, and enables delivery of conventional neurotransmitters with a spatial and temporal resolution closer to that of the natural neuronal circuitry. In addition, this new method allows the application of normally labile substances, such as the free radical gas nitric oxide, by the photoconversion of photosensitive precursors.
Melatonin modulates wireless (2.45 GHz)-induced oxidative injury through TRPM2 and voltage gated Ca2+ channels in brain and dorsal root ganglion in rat
 We aimed to investigate the protective effects of melatonin and 2.45 GHz electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on brain and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron antioxidant redox system, Ca2+ influx, cell viability and electroencephalography (EEG) records in the rat. Thirty two rats were equally divided into four different groups namely group A1: Cage control, group A2: Sham control, group B: 2.45 GHz EMR, group C: 2.45 GHz EMR + melatonin. Groups B and C were exposed to 2.45 GHz EMR during 60 min/day for 30 days. End of the experiments, EEG records and the brain cortex and DRG samples were taken. Lipid peroxidation (LP), cell viability and cytosolic Ca2+ values in DRG neurons were higher in group B than in groups A1 and A2 although their concentrations were increased by melatonin, 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borinate (2-APB), diltiazem and verapamil supplementation. Spike numbers of EEG records in group C were lower than in group B. Brain cortex vitamin E concentration was higher in group C than in group B. In conclusion, Melatonin supplementation in DRG neurons and brain seems to have protective effects on the 2.45 GHz-induced increase Ca2+ influx, EEG records and cell viability of the hormone through TRPM2 and voltage gated Ca2+ channels.
SnO2, ZnO and related polycrystalline compound semiconductors: An overview and review on the voltage-dependent resistance (non-ohmic) feature
 The present review describes mainly the history of SnO2-based voltage-dependent resistors, discusses the main characteristics of these polycrystalline semiconductor systems and includes a direct comparison with traditional ZnO-based voltage-dependent resistor systems to establish the differences and similarities, giving details of the basic physical principles involved with the non-ohmic properties in both polycrystalline systems. As an overview, the text also undertakes the main difficulties involved in processing SnO2- and ZnO-based non-ohmic systems, with an evaluation of the contribution of the dopants to the electronic properties and to the final microstructure and consequently to the system’s non-ohmic behavior. However, since there are at least two review texts regarding ZnO-based systems [Levinson, L. M., and Philipp, H. R. Ceramic Bulletin 1985;64:639; Clarke, D. R. Journal of American Ceramic Society 1999;82:485], the main focus of the present text is dedicated to the SnO2-based varistor systems, although the basic physical principles described in the text are universally useful in the context of dense polycrystalline devices. However, the readers must be careful of how the microstructure heterogeneity and grain-boundary chemistry are capable to interfere in the global electrical response for particular systems. New perspectives for applications, commercialization and degradation studies involving SnO2-based polycrystalline non-ohmic systems are also outlined, including recent technological developments. Finally, at the end of this review a brief section is particularly dedicated to the presentation and discussions about others emerging non-ohmic polycrystalline ceramic devices (particularly based on perovskite ceramics) which must be deeply studied in the years to come, specially because some of these systems present combined high dielectric and non-ohmic properties. From both scientific and technological point of view these perovskite systems are quite interesting.
Multipurpose experimental characterization of smart nanocomposite cement-based materials for thermal-energy efficiency and strain-sensing capability
 Novel nanocomposite smart multifunctional materials are emerging as promising technological advances in construction industry, where thermal-energy efficiency needs should meet environmental sustainability and mechanical performance requirements. In this view, new cement-based materials showed encouraging results in terms of added functional properties combining all the above mentioned capabilities with electrical conductivity and self-sensing potential for a variety of field scopes, e.g. vibration measurements, damage detection, structural health monitoring, electromagnetic shielding, self-heating pavements for deicing and more. The present paper deals with the development and multipurpose experimental characterization of cement-based materials doped with different carbon nanoinclusions consisting of: multi-walled carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon black, and graphene nanoplatelets. The study investigates morphology, optical features, thermal characteristics, electrical properties and strain-sensing capability of the different composites, through a campaign of in-lab experimental measurements. The results highlight the peculiar behavior of each composite material, which is strictly related to the adopted nanoinclusions, that reveal to be suitable for specific purposes. In particular, all carbon nanoinclusions are seen to reduce solar reflectance capability, while they produce negligible variations in thermal emittance. Graphene nanoplatelets represent the most effective nanoinclusion to increase thermal conductivity and diffusivity, which is related to their structural and geometrical characteristics and better capability to distribute the thermal wave. Consistently, the same graphene samples produce the largest electrical conductivity and capacitance. However, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, even though providing comparatively smaller contributions to electrical conductivity, are seen to be the best nanoinclusions for providing strain-sensing capabilities to the cement-based composites.
Transient and steady state currents of γ-irradiated 70/30 (wt/wt.%) polyvinyl alcohol/glycogen blend samples undoped and doped with eosin
 The transient currents, I–V characteristics and dc electrical conductivity of 70/30 (wt/wt.%) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/glycogen undoped and doped with eosin films have been studied under different conditions before and after irradiation by γ-doses in the range 5–100 kGy. The conduction mechanisms operative in the films at different temperature and γ-irradiation ranges are estimated from the behaviour of Log I versus V1/2 plots. The results show that both temperature and γ-irradiation affects the type of electronic transport mechanism for undoped blend sample. On doping with eosin, there is only considerable influence on the type of conduction with varying temperature but γ-doses have no significant effect. The dc conductivity for blend sample doped with eosin is found to increase by 1–2 orders of magnitude compared to the undoped sample at both different temperatures and γ-doses. The values of mobility and charge carrier concentration for all samples under investigation were found to vary from (0.26–2.22) × 10− 4m2V− 1 s− 1 and (0.52–76.20) × 1024 m− 3 respectively.
Current-voltage characteristics of lattice-mismatched GaInAs(n+)/GaAs(p) diodes including thermal annealing effects
 Current transport mechanisms and the effects of in-plane lattice-mismatch and thermal annealing were studied for Ga0.92In0.08As(n+)/GaAs(p) heterojunctions. We applied different models to fit the temperature dependent current-voltage characteristics in as-grown and the annealed heterojunctions. The results showed that thermionic emission or tunneling, or both processes combined, of the holes followed by interface recombination are the conduction mechanisms. The specific conduction mechanism is dependent upon the value of in-plane lattice mismatch and the thermal annealing. The interface charge was the main factor in controlling the hole conduction paths. The fact that the interface charge density is proportional to the in-plane lattice mismatch, which was observed in the as-grown samples, was no longer true for samples with a large in-plane mismatch (> 0.44%) after thermal annealing. The slow current transients were greatly reduced although the in-plane mismatch was increased in these large mismatched samples by the thermal annealing. The capture cross sections of interface states were all increased after a rapid thermal annealing at 800°C. The interface charge density in this material system was in the range of 1–7 × 1011 cm−2.
Simultaneous, live imaging of cortical spreading depression and associated cerebral blood flow changes, by combining voltage-sensitive dye and laser speckle contrast methods
 Cortical spreading depression (i.e. waves of cellular depolarization, CSD) causes the aura symptoms in classical migraine, and may contribute to delayed cellular damage after an ischemic or traumatic insult to the brain. In the latter cases, secondary neuronal injury may be worsened by some of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes that are associated with CSD. Here, we describe a new method for the simultaneous, live imaging of local cellular depolarization and CBF changes (i.e. two variables with well-defined and important biological significance), through a closed cranial window prepared in anesthetized rats. This novel experimental strategy was validated by imaging the changes associated with CSD elicited by application of high K+ medium on the cortical surface. CSD was visualized directly by using a fluorescent voltage-sensitive (VS) dye, whereas laser speckle contrast (LSC) imaging allowed the visualization of the corresponding CBF changes. In addition to the high temporal and spatial resolution of VS dye and LSC imaging, their novel combination allows to determine how CBF changes relate to a heterogeneous and evolving pattern of cellular depolarization, in any area of interest of the cortical region under study. This methodological development is especially pertinent and timely for investigations into the peri-lesion depolarizations that occur in models of focal brain injury, situations where their site of spontaneous elicitation and propagation pattern cannot be predicted. It should also help advance our knowledge in epilepsy, CBF pharmacology, and neurovascular coupling under normal and pathophysiological conditions.
Fast-Spiking Interneurons Supply Feedforward Control of Bursting, Calcium, and Plasticity for Efficient Learning
 Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a prominent class of forebrain GABAergic cells implicated in two seemingly independent network functions: gain control and network plasticity. Little is known, however, about how these roles interact. Here, we use a combination of cell-type-specific ablation, optogenetics, electrophysiology, imaging, and behavior to describe a unified mechanism by which striatal FSIs control burst firing, calcium influx, and synaptic plasticity in neighboring medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). In vivo silencing of FSIs increased bursting, calcium transients, and AMPA/NMDA ratios in MSNs. In a motor sequence task, FSI silencing increased the frequency of calcium transients but reduced the specificity with which transients aligned to individual task events. Consistent with this, ablation of FSIs disrupted the acquisition of striatum-dependent egocentric learning strategies. Together, our data support a model in which feedforward inhibition from FSIs temporally restricts MSN bursting and calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity to facilitate striatum-dependent sequence learning.
Ageing of electric cables in light water reactors (LWRs)
 This chapter will address the ageing of nuclear power plant cables and test methods for these cables to manage ageing and verify reliability. The focus will be on instrumentation and control (I&C) cables, low-voltage cables and medium-voltage cables. Ageing due to long-term exposure to temperature, radiation, humidity, and other environments can cause the cable insulation material to deteriorate, allowing moisture into the cable. This can in turn cause cable failure and jeopardize plant safety. Various techniques are available to assess cable condition and health, including electrical and mechanical measurements, and chemical tests. Of these, electrical measurements are preferred as they allow in-situ cable testing in operating plants. Prognostic techniques estimate residual life of cables using data from periodic tests. To guard against ageing, nuclear power plants are implementing ageing management programs and regulators are writing new requirements for acceptable programs and techniques for cable ageing management.
Measurement
 This chapter deals with the multiphase flow meter. The major parts of the TopFlow meter are the Venturi insert and the electrodes inside the Venturi throat. The flow rates of oil, water, and gas are calculated based on the measurements performed by the electrodes and the measurement of the differential pressure across the Venturi inlet. The TopFlow meter utilizes a capacitance sensor for oil-continuous liquid mixtures, where the capacitance caused by the dielectric constant of the fluid mixture is measured in the throat of the Venturi. Similarly, it utilizes a four-electrode conductance sensor for water-continuous liquid mixtures, where the conductance is caused by the conductivity of the fluid mixture. All the necessary electrodes are incorporated within a Venturi that is somewhat modified. Advanced data processing is utilized to have continuous readings of the flow rates of oil, water, and gas.
Temporal evolution of transient transverse beam profiles in near-field zones
 The transmission through transversal planes of short ultrasonic pulses, generated in water by circular planar and focussed broadband piezoelectric transducers, is analysed in detail by means of a thin temporal chopping of the transverse beam profiles. This is carried out with a quasi-punctual microprobe in the MHz frequency range using a detection procedure based on shifting narrow temporal gates (widths of the order of 1[10f0]). In this way, the resulting series of temporal chops enables certain sequences of acoustic events, normally hidden in conventional plots, to be visualized. This fact facilitates the analysis of some significant near-field transient effects which must be taken into account for high resolution pulse—echo applications. The influence of some kinds of radiation irregularities from the transducer vibrating surface is also analysed in field-planes parallel to the emitting aperture. Theoretical results, obtained through approaches based on the impulse response method for particular near-field zones, are compared with experimental data revealing some non-ideal effects.
A technique for velocity measurement in diesel sprays
 A single-beam laser anemometer system, using a fast response Michelson interferometer, has been adapted to permit measurements in diesel sprays. The technique measures liquid phase velocity, as a function of time, in the dense spray zone, within 40 nozzle diameters of the injector. Measurement accuracy is demonstrated by agreement of near-nozzle velocity signals with those expected from the separately measured nozzle flow rate versus time characteristics of the injector-pump combination. The velocity measurements indicate reduction in velocity with distance downstream and with increasing gas pressure. They show good agreement with velocities obtained by penetration rate measurements. The presence of crossflow is detected by the removal of the slower moving smaller droplets. The technique is found to be suitable for measurements in dense and transient flows such as those produced by diesel injectors.
Effects of low magnetic fields in transient spectral hole-burning of the R1-line in emerald, Be3Al2Si6O18:Cr(III)
 Polarized transient spectral hole-burning in the R1-line (2Ā(2E) ← 4A2) of Chatham lab grown emerald is reported as a function of low magnetic fields B∥c and B⊥c (<16 mT) and temperature. The experiments yield g-factors g⊥(4A2)=1.96 ± 0.02, g∥(4A2)=1.97 ± 0.02 and g∥[2Ā(2E)]=1.02 ± 0.03. The hole patterns indicate that spin-lattice relaxation between the Zeeman split spin levels of the ground and excited state is slow at 2.5 K. Spin-lattice relaxation by an Orbach process appears to become efficient for the 2Ā(2E) levels at temperatures >8 K on the 2.5 ms experimental timescale but thermalization between the ±3/2 4A2 levels stays relatively slow up to 25 K. The potential of transient hole-burning experiments is manifested by the present experiments: g-factors and spin-lattice relaxation times can be measured simultaneously for the ground and the excited state.
Construction and performance of a photobleaching recovery apparatus with microsecond time resolution
 A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) apparatus was constructed to measure sub-millisecond fluorescence recovery processes in living cells. The photobleaching pulse and probe beams were generated by modulating the intensity of a continuous wave Argon laser (4 W) by two acousto-optic modulators in series. The maximum intensity modulation was > 106:1 with a rise time of < 1 μs and a minimum pulse width of 6 μs. Fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier, amplified by a transimpedance amplifier, and digitized at 1 MHz. During the photobleaching pulse, the photomultiplier gain was reduced by ca. 1500-fold by switching the second dynode voltage ca. 100 V negative with respect to the cathode voltage by computer control of two bidirectional Mosfet optoisolators. The switching circuit produced a transient anode current (t ≈ 15 μs) which was subtracted for measurement of recoveries of < 50–100 μs. The apparatus was coupled to an inverted microscope for measurement of fluorescence by epi-illumination or total internal reflection. Instrument performance was evaluated by measurement of the rapid fluorescence recoveries of fluorescein and fluorescein-dextrans in solutions and living cells.
Symmetrically biased T/R switches for NMR and MRI with microsecond dead time
 For direct NMR detection and imaging of compounds with very short coherence life times the dead time between radio-frequency (RF) pulse and reception of the free induction decay (FID) is a major limiting factor. It is typically dominated by the transient and recovery times of currently available transmit–receive (T/R) switches and amplification chains. A novel PIN diode-based T/R switch topology is introduced allowing for fast switching by high bias transient currents but nevertheless producing a very low video leakage signal and insertion loss (0.5 dB). The low transient spike level in conjunction with the high isolation (75 dB) prevent saturation of the preamplifier entirely which consequently does not require time for recovery. Switching between transmission and reception is demonstrated within less than 1 μs in bench tests as well as in acquisitions of FIDs and zero echo time (ZTE) images with bandwidths up to 500 kHz at 7 T. Thereby the 2 kW switch exhibited a rise-time of 350 ns (10–99%) producing however a total video leakage of below 20 mV peak-to-peak and less than −89 dBm in-band. The achieved switching time renders the RF pulse itself the dominant contribution to the dead time in which a coherence cannot be observed, thus making pulsed NMR experiments almost time-optimal even for compounds with very short signal life times.
Acoustic signal processing with robust machine learning algorithm for improved monitoring of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline
 The flow of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline can significantly erode mechanical equipment. Hence, real-time quantitative monitoring is a timely need for the oil and gas industry to achieve real-time control and production optimisation. Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted employing acoustic signals for qualitative monitoring, there is still an unmet demand for a simple and robust real-time quantitative monitoring system. Acoustic signal processing with machine learning is a simple and robust method that has the potential to meet this demand but has not been previously exploited for real-time quantitative monitoring of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline. This paper proposes a novel instrumentation system for on-line measurement of solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity in a gas-solid multiphase flow using acoustic sensing technology coupled with signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithm. The acoustic sensor is used to capture the acoustic wave emitted from the impingements of the solid particles on the bend component of the flowline. Signal processing techniques are used to extract relevant features about the impingements. An integrated, conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to capture the distribution of the acoustic feature vectors in order to establish the relationship between the measurands and the acoustic signal. However, conventional ANNs are mainly concerned with capturing systematic patterns in a distribution of measurements fixed in time and in this case the dynamics of the generated acoustic signal varies with time. A modification, called Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is used to capture such dynamics. The proposed system compares the performance of the classical ANN and the TDNN models. Results obtained demonstrate that with the classical ANN, the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) is 0.66, 0.29, 0.26 and 0.46 for the solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity respectively. With the TDNN model, the NRMSE is 0.18, 0.17, 0.20 and 0.16 for the solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity respectively. In comparison with the ANN model, the TDNN model has better performance as the NRMSE values are lower for all the models for the measurands. Overall, this study lays the basis for employing signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithm in the development of a simple, reliable and low cost real-time quantitative particulate solid flow monitoring system.
Shock-wave measurement using a calibrated interferometric fiber-tip sensor
 The results of shock-wave measurements using a calibrated fiber-tip sensor based on a Michelson interferometer are presented. A transfer function, obtained by an independent experiment that describes the properties of the sensor system, was used to correct the measured shock-wave data in the Fourier frequency domain. The phase of the transfer function was determined from its amplitude by a fitting procedure using minimum-phase terms. As an example of application, the acoustic output field of an electromagnetic lithotriptor was investigated, and the shock-wave source was reliably characterized. The measured data provide a basis for estimating the hazard to which a patient is exposed during shock-wave treatment and for optimizing a lithotriptor system to produce a sharply localized and effective acoustic field.
Low-frequency gain dispersion in ion-implanted InP JFETs
 The dispersion in the low-frequency transconductance and output resistance and its effect on the voltage gain of an ion-implanted InP JFET are reported. The dispersion consists of a reduction in both the transconductance and the output resistance occurring between 10 Hz and 1 MHz. The primary transconductance dispersion mechanism appears to be due to surface traps located in the ungated access regions, while the output resistance dispersion appears to be caused by traps located in the substrate under the channel. This conclusion is supported by transient response measurements. An equivalent circuit which simulates the dispersion is presented. This circuit can be used for the design of monolithic fiber-optic preamplifiers and other small-signal circuits.
Spontaneous and experimentally evoked [Ca2+]i-transients in cardiac myocytes measured by means of a fast Fura-2 technique
 A setup for dual wavelength-excitation fluorescence measurements is introduced which permits a temporal resolution of up to 1 KHz, using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2. The system makes use of a novel technical solution for chopping between two excitation wavelengths which does not move any optical components. Two beams, which are alternatively opened or shut by a rotating chopper wheel, are united by a dichroic mirror and are used for low-noise epifluorescence microscopy. The system includes a device for fast changes of extracellular solution that can be used for studying various components of [Ca2+]i-regulation in excitable and non-excitable cells. Sample recordings of spontaneous and experimentally-evoked [Ca2+]i-transients from cardiac myocytes are presented. Cardiac myocytes are a cell species that produces particularly fast [Ca2+]i-transients and therefore, a high temporal resolution is required in order to study physiological and/or pharmacological properties of these transients.
Eye movement measurement
 This chapter presents the historical background as well as the current technological status of electro-oculography (EOG) and videooculography (VOG) technology. It also discusses the magnetic search coil technique that by many is still regarded as the “gold standard” of eye movement measurement, and which provides very high spatial and temporal resolution. Early measurement techniques were based on a variety of physical principles. Most of these approaches were technically complex, semi-invasive, and caused considerable discomfort for the patient. Further developments in optical techniques led to the various forms of photoelectro-nystagmography and ultimately to videobased techniques. Currently, EOG and VOG are widely used for eye movement measurement in the clinical environment. While the convenience and advantages of videobased devices are widely recognized, there remain a number of situations where the use of EOG is preferable and/or necessary. For those research applications requiring more precise and in many cases 3-dimensional measurement, the electromagnetic scleral search coil technique (SSC) and the more elaborate 3D-VOG systems are employed.
Real-time measurement and control at JET experiment control
 Over the past few years, the preparation of ITER-relevant plasma scenarios has been the main focus of experimental activity on tokamaks. The development of integrated, simultaneous, real-time controls of plasma shape, current, pressure, temperature, radiation, neutron profiles and also impurities, ELMs and MHD are now seen to be essential for further development of quasi-steady state conditions with feedback, or the stabilisation of transient phenomena with event-driven actions. For this thrust, the EFDA JET Real-Time Project has developed a set of real-time plasma measurements, experiment control and communication facilities. The plasma diagnostics used for real-time experiments are Far Infra Red interferometry, polarimetry, visible, UV and X-ray spectroscopy, LIDAR, bolometry, neutron and magnetics. Further analysis systems produce integrated results, such as temperature profiles on geometry derived from MHD equilibrium solutions. The actuators include toroidal, poloidal and divertor coils, gas and pellet fuelling, neutral beam injection, radio frequency (ICRH) waves and microwaves (LH). The heating/fuelling operators can either define a power or gas request waveform or select the real-time instantaneous power/gas request from the real-time experiment central control (RTCC) system. The real-time experiment control system provides both a high-level, control-programming environment and interlocks with the actuators. A MATLAB facility is being developed for the development of more complex controllers. The plasma measurement, controller and plant control systems communicate in ATM network. The EFDA Real-Time Project is essential groundwork for future reactors such as ITER. It involves many staff from several institutions. The facility is now frequently used in experiments. This work has been conducted under the European Fusion Development Agreement and is partly funded by Euratom and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
Dynamic response of twisted nematic liquid crystal cells to transiently pulsed fields
 The transient optical response of a TN cell to single field pulses is experimentally investigated. The optical threshold for pulses is investigated as a function of pulse width and cell parameters d and θ. The subsequent relaxation of the cell below optical threshold is inferred by investigation of the sensitivity of the cell to a second delayed pulse. A method of calculating tilt angles from capacitance measurements of LC cells is also described.
Analysis of transient structures by cryo-microscopy combined with rapid mixing of spray droplets
 A simple method to determine transient conformations of biological molecules is described. The two reactants (e.g. protein complex and ligand) are mixed rapidly by the coalescence of spray droplets containing one component, with a thin, grid-supported aqueous film containing the other. The transient state is then trapped by rapid freezing, and investigated later by cryo-microscopy. Images of conformations associated with reaction times of 1–100 ms can be achieved by adjusting the delay between the droplet impact and freezing. The droplets (typically 1 μm in diameter) are propelled onto the grid by an atomizer spray. It is shown that the droplets impinging on the liquid film spread rapidly over its surface under the influence of surface tension, and only weakly disturb the underlying film, partially displacing its contents away from the point of impact. Experiments with sprayed salt solutions, using vesicles derived from erythrocytes as micro-osmometers, indicate that rapid mixing occurs both through the film and laterally, by diffusion. The spraying does not produce any detectable concentration changes due to drying in either the droplets or the film, and the method is applicable to high-resolution imaging.
Development of atomic beam probe for tokamaks
 The concept and development of a new detection method for light alkali ions stemming from diagnostic beams installed on medium size tokamak is described. The method allows us the simultaneous measurement of plasma density fluctuations and fast variations in poloidal magnetic field, therefore one can infer the fast changes in edge plasma current. The concept has been worked out and the whole design process has been done at Wigner RCP. The test detector with appropriate mechanics and electronics is already installed on COMPASS tokamak. General ion trajectory calculation code (ABPIons) has also been developed. Detailed calculations show the possibility of reconstruction of edge plasma current density profile changes with high temporal resolution, and the possibility of density profile reconstruction with better spatial resolution compared to standard Li-BES measurement, this is important for pedestal studies.
Transmission transients induced by optical phase switching
 In this article we describe a new class of coherent transient effects that are induced by a rapid change in the phase of light passing through an absorbing medium. These effects may be used to study dynamical processes involving visible or infrared transitions.
Time- and frequency-dependent effects of potassium channel blockers on large and medium diameter optic tract axons
 Compound action potential recording techniques were used to investigate the time- and frequency-dependent effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) on large diameter, fast conducting (t1) and medium diameter, middle conducting (t2) optic tract axons in anesthetized hooded rats. Single-pulse studies show 4-AP causes a rapid decrease in t1 and t2 response amplitude with larger decreases and longer lasting effects in t2 axons. In both axons, 4-AP leads to waveform broadening which is accounted for by increases in fall time since rise time and conduction velocity are unaffected by 4-AP. Strength-duration curves reveal 4-AP increases rheobase and decreases chronaxie in both axons with larger increases occurring in t1. T1, but not t2, axons also display some TEA-sensitivity. The absolute and relative refractory periods, determined with paired-pulse recovery functions, are increased by 4-AP to a greater degree in t1 and than t2 axons, however, display equal sensitivity to TEA. In contrast, 4-AP and TEA decrease frequency following in both axons with larger effects observed in t2. Based on our data, and that of others, we speculate that t1 axons exhibit 4-AP and TEA sensitivity at nodal/paranodal regions and not at internodal regions, while t2 axons exhibit 4-AP sensitivity at nodal/paranodal and internodal regions and TEA sensitivity only at internodal regions of the axolemma. The possible relevance of these findings to the distribution of 4-AP- and TEA-sensitive potassium channels on t1 and t2 axons and the coding of visual spatial and temporal information remains to be determined.
A fibre-optic sensor for flocculation detection by electric field light scattering
 A laser-based apparatus is described that is able to differentiate between the isolated and flocculated state of colloidal particles in concentrated suspensions. It is based on the principle that the intensity of the scattered light changes when anisodiametric particles are made to rotate and align in an electric field. The system is demonstrated by measurements on kaolinite clay suspensions and can be readily adapted to monitor and control suspensions deflocculation in ‘on-line’ industrial processes.
Geotechnical Underground Sensing and Monitoring
 The use of field instrumentation for condition assessment of geo-structures or to monitor the on-site behavior of foundations, soils, embankments, and structures is being required more and more on many projects. This chapter introduces the most commonly used sensors employed for monitoring of underground geomechanics. By combining elements from civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering together with some management concepts in a coherent modular format. The chapter begins with measurement of strain, since strain is often employed for monitoring a variety of common geotechnical processes. Next measurement of load, pressure, displacement, and tilt is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of common measurement errors and typical sensor specifications.
Imaging of calcium transients in skeletal muscle fibers
 Epifluorescence images of Ca2+ transients elicited by electrical stimulation of single skeletal muscle fibers were studied with fast imaging techniques that take advantage of the large fluorescence signals emitted at relatively long wavelengths by the dyes fluo-3 and rhod-2 in response to binding of Ca2+ ions, and of the suitable features of a commercially available CCD video camera. The localized release of Ca2+ in response to microinjection of InsP3 was also monitored to demonstrate the adequate space and time resolutions of the imaging system. The time resolution of the imager system, although limited to the standard video frequency response, still proved to be adequate to investigate the fast Ca2+ release process in skeletal muscle fibers at low temperatures.
Influence of positive inotropic agents on intracellular calcium transients. Part I. Normal rat heart
 This study, which was designed to evaluate the effects of positive inotropic agents on intracellular calcium transients ([Ca2+]i), is the first to analyze calcium transients in the whole heart. The positive inotropic agents that augment intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (dibutyryl CAMP, amrinone, and isoproterenol) caused an increase in developed pressure and [Ca2+]i transients and a decrease in diastolic [Ca2+]i. On the other hand, the glycoside digoxin and the a-adrenoceptor agents, phenylephrine and dobutamine, also caused an increase in [Ca2+]i transients and developed pressure. However, unlike the agents that increase [cAMP]i, they induced an elevation in diastolic [Ca2+]i. With all the positive inotropic agents, developed pressure increased commensurately with the percentage changes in amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients.
EMI on diagnostics and control circuits due to switching power supplies
 This paper deals with the electro magnetic interferences (EMI) induced on diagnostics and control circuits of fusion experiments, due to fast common mode voltages (Vcm) transients. The Vcm can excite the circulation of noise currents through parasitic capacitances, which couple different parts of the circuit designed to be isolated one to another. Equivalent electric circuits of the phenomena observed in RFX have been derived, which explain the induced noises and have been utilized to identify suitable correction measures; the paper describes these analyses and the experience gained in coping with the reduction of these types of EMI interferences.
Glial and neuronal forms of the voltage-dependent sodium channel: characteristics and cell-type distribution
 Two functionally different forms of the voltage-dependent sodium channel were observed in glia and in neurons of the mammalian nervous system. Both forms had identical conductance and tetrodotoxin sensitivity and displayed steady-state inactivation, a strongly voltage-dependent rate of activation, and a faster but weakly voltage-sensitive rate of inactivation. However, the glial form had significantly slower kinetics and a more negative voltage dependence, suggesting that it was functionally specialized for glia. This form was found in most glial types studied, while the neuronal form was observed in retinal ganglion cells, cortical motor neurons, and O2A glial progenitor cells. Both forms occurred in type-2 astrocytes. The presence of the glial form correlated with the RAN-2 surface antigen.
Theory and kinematic measurements of the mechanics of stable electrospun polymer jets
 We present a simplified approach to understanding the mechanics of stable electrospinning jets based on electrohydrodynamic theory that explicitly incorporates the extensional rheology of polymeric fluids. Flow regimes of electrospun jets are identified by analogy to uniaxial extension of a fluid jet. These flow regimes predict the limiting kinematics of electrospinning jets and identify dimensionless parameters important to the control and operation of electrospinning processes. In situ kinematic measurements validate model assumptions and scaling predictions, and allow the reduction of entire jet radius and velocity profiles to several key parameters. The model predictions are shown to hold both above and below the entanglement concentration, as well as for solutions with added electrolyte and increased conductivity. The analysis also enables direct measurement of the apparent extensional viscosity of solutions at the high extension rates experienced during electrospinning. Finally, dimensional analysis of the model yields a correlation for electrospun fiber diameter in terms of measurable fluid properties, controlled process parameters, and measured jet variables, demonstrating the influence of mechanics in the straight portion of the jet on ultimate fiber morphology.
Electro-optic gain control and cavity dumping of a Nd: Glass laser with active-passive mode-locking
 Improved operation of a 10 Hz, hybrid-modelocked glass laser is reported. Generating transient cavity losses during the nonlinear regime of pulse formation yields shorter pulses of 2.5 ps duration and improved reproducibility. The background level of satellite pulses is simultaneously reduced by more than one order of magnitude.
The step-change cooling performance of miniature thermoelectric module for pulse laser
 This article investigates a miniature thermoelectric module (MTEM) for pulse laser cooling. A step-changed cooling model is developed to predict the thermal performance of the MTEM. Interfacial effects of the MTEM are analyzed by considering the thermal non-equilibrium between electrons and phonons adjacent to thermoelectric/metal interface. Parametric studies were performed to analyze the effect of the pulse-width of laser, thermal resistance of hot-end heat exchanger, cooling load and the step-changed voltage on the system cooling performance. Particular attention is paid to the influence of scaling effect and supercooling effect on enhancing the miniature thermoelectric cooling (MTEC) performance. At a specific cooling load, the effects of pulse-changed and step-changed voltage on MTEC are numerically and experimentally studied. The MTEM can deal with not only the low cooling load of continuous laser, but also high cooling load of pulse laser which surpasses its’ maximum cooling capacity. The transient response of cold-end temperature experiences an underdamped oscillation and finally reaching a steady-state value. A curve fitting equation for cold-end temperature is used to provide more accurate temperature and understand the temperature control strategy for pulse laser. The numerical result shows that the prediction by the model agrees well with the performance curve of datasheet and experimental data. It is also found that the voltage for achieving the maximum cooling capacity experiences step decrease with the increase of thermal resistance of hot-end heat exchanger.
Snubber resistor influence in the thyristor valves failure on the static VAR compensator
 In this research, a complex engineering failure analysis is done for a static VAR compensator (SVC), it was installed in Perú 220 kV system. The research introduce the selected results of the simulations and field tests completed during the fault, mitigation and corrective activities performed at the thyristor valve, which is installed in the thyristor switched capacitor (TSC) and thyristor controlled reactor (TCR) of the SVC. This paper proposes the most feasible solution to overcome the failure of the TSC based on snubber resistor in the SVC. In order to investigate the causes of this failure, various measurements were carried out on the TSC. It was concluded that a snubber resistor design needs two special test for determinate a problem or abnormal condition; a special test should be done in the factory acceptance test (FAT), site acceptance test (SAT) and to execute a maintenance diagnosis, to prevent a failure in the thyristor valve from TSC. This failure has happened in the standby system, the susceptance reference is forced to follow the susceptance reference received from the active system. There is however, a delay in the transfer of data from the active to the standby system. During transient conditions this may cause a difference in thyristor firing angles between the systems. The simulated current in the standby system does not agree with the measured current, which is controlled by the active system, an advanced diagnosis and design review is developed for to avoid a sudden failure. The feasibility of these solutions was verified through the computer simulation with PSCAD/EMTDC.
On remote measurements of lightning return stroke peak currents
 Return-stroke peak current is one of the most important measures of lightning intensity needed in different areas of atmospheric electricity research. It can be estimated from the corresponding electric or magnetic radiation field peak. Electric fields of 89 strokes in lightning flashes triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique at Camp Blanding (CB), Florida, were recorded at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, about 45 km from the lightning channel. Lightning return-stroke peak currents were estimated from the measured electric field peaks using the empirical formula of Rakov et al. (1992) and the field-to-current conversion equation based on the transmission line model (Uman and McLain, 1969). These estimates, along with peak currents reported by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), were compared with the ground-truth data, currents directly measured at the lightning channel base. The empirical formula, based on data for 28 triggered-lightning strokes acquired at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), tends to overestimate peak currents, whereas the NLDN-reported peak currents are on average underestimates. The field-to-current conversion equation based on the transmission line model gives the best match with directly measured peak currents for return-stroke speeds between c/2 and 2c/3 (1.5 and 2 × 108 m/s, respectively). Possible reasons for the discrepancy in the peak current estimates from the empirical formula and the ground-truth data include an error in the field calibration factor, difference in the typical return-stroke speeds at CB and at the KSC (considered here to be the most likely reason), and limited sample sizes, particularly for the KSC data. A new empirical formula, I = − 0.66–0.028rE, based on data for 89 strokes in lightning flashes triggered at CB, is derived.
Time-dependent electric field in Al/CdTe/Pt detectors
 Al/CdTe/Pt detectors are very attractive devices for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, even though they suffer from bias-induced time instability (polarization). Polarization phenomena cause a progressive time-degradation of the spectroscopic performance of the detectors, due to hole trapping and detrapping from deep acceptor levels that directly control the electric field distribution. In this work we present experimental investigations on the electric field profile of planar Al/CdTe/Pt detectors by means of Pockels effect measurements. The time/temperature dependence of the electric field was investigated in a long time window (up to 10 h) and the correlation with the reverse current transients was also studied. Two energy levels (0.62 eV and 1.16 eV) of the deep hole traps were measured, in agreement with our previous results obtained through electrical and spectroscopic approaches.
Design and fabrication of an automated technique: measurement of spontaneous polarization in two new schiff base ferroelectric liquid crystals
 A technique for the measurement of spontaneous polarization (Ps) in ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC’s) is presented. Modification in the data acquisition part to measure the loop area of transient current due to the spontaneous polarization is described. Temperature dependence of the spontaneous polarization measured for the compound ZLI-3775 was found to agree with data provided by E. Merck Industrial Chemicals. The relative advantages and ease of operation in the present technique are discussed. This setup facilitates simultaneous measurement of spontaneous polarization and response times. Using the present setup, variation of the spontaneous polarization and response times with temperature are reported for two new Schiff base compounds, 4-undecyloxy benzylidene-4′-amino-2-methylbutylcinamate (UOBAMBC) and 4-(2-chloro-propionyloxy) benzylindene-4′-amino-2-methylbutylcinamate (CPOBAMBC). The magnitude of Ps for CPOBAMBC is twice that of UOBAMBC.
An ultrasonic approach for the measurement of oil films in the piston zone
 Control of the lubrication of the piston reciprocating in the liner is a key part of the efficient operation of an internal combustion engine. A thick lubricant film leads to excessive oil in the combustion zone, while an inadequate film leads to bore polishing. In this work a method for the non-invasive measurement of the oil film thickness using reflected ultrasound is described. The method is explained in relation to two cases studied; the first on the contact between the piston skirt and liner in a fired engine, the second on the ring liner contacts in a bench test apparatus.
Current-voltage characteristics of planar lipid membranes with attached Halobacterium cell-envelope vesicles
 We have studied the photoactivity of a system consisting of large, planar, essentially solvent free bilayers bearing adsorbed cell-envelope vesicles prepared from Halobacterium halobium (strain L 33). The system was made conductive by addition of a proton carrier (SF-6847). We observed photocurrents which were linearly dependent upon transmembrane voltage. Current-voltage curves were found to be well described by an equivalent circuit with the following significant parameters: planar bilayer conductance, planar bilayer-vesicle contact area conductance, cell-envelope vesicle conductance, and chloride pump equivalent voltage-generator potential. These parameters are uniquely obtained as a result of a few independent current measurements. The stationary photovoltage was dependent upon chloride concentration, and from this dependence an active transport (pump) affinity of the system for chloride was calculated to be about 50 mM.
A fast protection scheme for VSC based multi-terminal DC grid
 This paper proposes a novel protection scheme for voltage source converter based multi-terminal direct current (VSC-MTDC) grid, in which DC line pilot protection applies polarity comparison of initial current travelling wave and DC busbar protection is based on sampled value current differential theory. This DC line protection utilizes modulus maximum of wavelet transform to get the polarity of initial current travelling wave on two ends of DC lines to distinguish internal faults from external faults. Current differential protection based on sampling values is adopted as DC busbar protection, which has the characteristics of fast operation speed and less computation compared to conventional current differential protection. A two-level voltage source converter (VSC) based four-terminal DC grid is built on the PSCAD platform and each VSC is equipped with resistive superconducting fault current limiters (R-SFCLs) to limit the short circuit current. Thus, DC circuit breakers can be used to break the DC fault current. The simulation results verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed VSC-MTDC grid protection scheme.
Pulsed beam measurement system
 This article describes the elements of the pulsed beam measurement system at the AMS facility in Utrecht, in particular the switched power supplies and the current integrator.
Non-contacting spatially resolved measurements of Fermi energy and photoconductivity in semi-insulating undoped GaAs and InP:Fe
 Variable temperature resistivity mappings have been conducted on samples of undoped gallium arsenide, grown by liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEG), using a non-contacting electrical technique. These have been used to produce maps of the spatial variation of activation energy of conductivity. Insertion of a fibre optic into the electrode assembly has allowed non-contacting scanning photoconductivity measurements to be made. Preliminary results on semi-insulating InP:Fe are reported.
Application of very small force measurements in monitoring the response of sunflower to weak blue light
 A diaheliotropic response of sunflower, Helianthus annuus, following a short pulse of low intensity blue light to a small area of leaf surface was examined with the application of the very low-force-measurements technique (the order of magnitude of 10−5 N). One leaf from a pair was illuminated with a low intensity blue-light-pulse and the force was recorded, generated by the stem of the plant tending to bend. A very low phototropic effect in response to blue light alone was observed which could be considerably enhanced by the application of background illumination with red light. Microelectrode measurements of the membrane potential of the mesophyll cells of the sunflower leaf showed hyperpolarization in response to a blue light pulse, observed very clearly under application of the red light background illumination. The hyperpolarization of the membrane potential was accompanied by acidification of extracellular compartments as monitored with a miniature pH-sensitive electrode, placed in the epidermis of the stem. The relatively short lag period between the hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and the decrease in pH suggests that the hyperpolarization is a direct effect of the blue light-induced proton extrusion. The acidification correlates with the light response, which suggests that acidification-induced stem wall loosening is responsible for the blue light-induced bending. The examined mechanisms are discussed in terms of sun tracking by a sunflower.
UHV AC System Overvoltage and Insulation Coordination
 In terms of overvoltage and insulation coordination, a UHV system is similar to an extra-high-voltage (EHV) system. However, as UHV system lines are characterized by a larger transmission capacity, longer transmission distances, and large reactive power (the reactive power per 100 km of 1000-kV lines reaches up to about 530 Mvar) such that: (1) load rejection may cause serious temporary overvoltage; (2) changes in load during normal operation may cause many problems in respect of reactive power regulation, voltage control, and extinction of secondary arc resulting from single-phase reclosing. Additionally, considerations such as the saturation of large air gaps under high-voltage and high-altitude installation, etc., have resulted in complicated insulation structures and increased equipment size, affecting manufacturing costs and other indices of the equipment. This chapter addresses how more stringent requirements can be placed on overvoltage suppression and insulation coordination.
Measurement of residence time distribution in microfluidic systems
 We present a method for measuring the residence time distribution (RTD) in microfluidic systems. A piezoelectrically actuated sample injector releases approximately 100 nl of tracer liquid into a microchannel of rectangular cross section. The spreading of the tracer pulse in pressure-driven microflows is monitored with fluorescence microscopy measurements. Residence time distributions are determined for single-phase liquid and segmented gas–liquid microflows, with the RTD being significantly narrower for the latter case. The selected flow conditions are relevant to synthesis in microreactors with residence times up to several minutes.
Voltage-dependent calcium and calcium-activated potassium currents of a molluscan photoreceptor
 Two-microelectrode voltage clamp studies were performed on the somata of Hermissenda Type B photoreceptors that had been isolated by axotomy from all synaptic interaction as well as any impulse-generating (i.e., active) membrane. In the presence of 2–10 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and 100 mM tetraethylammonium ion (TEA), which eliminated two previously described voltage-dependent potassium currents (IA and the delayed rectifier), a voltage-dependent outward current was apparent in the steady state responses to command voltage steps more positive than -40 mV (absolute). This current increased with increasing external Ca++. The magnitude of the outward current decreased and an inward current became apparent following EGTA injection. Substitution of external Ba++ for Ca++ also made the inward current more apparent. This inward current, which was almost eliminated after being exposed for approximately 5 min to a solution in which external Ca++ was replaced with Cd++, was maximally activated at approximately 0 mV. Elevation of external potassium allowed the calcium (ICa++) and calcium-dependent K+ (IC) currents to be substantially separated. Command pulses to 0 mV elicited maximal ICa++ but no IC because no K+ currents flowed at their new reversal potential (0 mV) in 300 mM K+. At a holding potential of -60 mV, which was now more negative than the potassium equilibrium potential, EK+, in 300 mM K+, IC appeared as an inward tail current after positive command steps. The voltage dependence of ICa++ was demonstrated with positive steps in 100 mM Ba++, 4-AP, and TEA. Other data indicated that in 10 mM Ca++, IC underwent pronounced and prolonged inactivation whereas ICa++ did not. When the photoreceptor was stimulated with a light step (with the membrane potential held at -60 mV), there was also a prolonged inactivation of IC. In elevated external Ca++, ICa++ also showed similar inactivation. These data suggest that IC may undergo prolonged inactivation due to a direct effect of elevated intracellular Ca++, as was previously shown for a voltage-dependent potassium current, IA. These results are discussed in relation to the production of training-induced changes of membrane currents on retention days of associative learning.
Faults diagnosis and control in a low-cost fault-tolerant induction motor drive system
 The paper deals with faults diagnosis and control methods for a fault-tolerant direct field-oriented controlled by Space Vector Modulation (SVM) two-level voltage-inverter-fed induction motor drive. In order to maintain an uninterrupted motor drive operation even under its faulty condition, two diagnostic algorithms as well as post-fault control techniques are developed. According to the first diagnostic system, that is related to single open-circuit faults in two-level voltage inverter, a failure diagnosis is performed by monitoring a time presence of a reference inverter voltage vector in particular sectors of the α–β coordinate system. After the fault detection, to maintain a high-quality drive performance, a switch-redundant inverter scheme is utilized. In case of the second diagnostic system, for the speed sensor failure detection, a motor speed estimator, that is based on a model reference adaptive system, is utilized. This algorithm is used for the post-fault motor drive operation as well. Both fault monitoring methods are based on a software solution, therefore they do not generate additional implementation costs. To validate the described fault-tolerant control scheme, chosen simulation tests, which were carried out in MATLAB/Simulink, are presented. Additionally, in case of the transistor failure diagnosis, experimental tests were carried out.
Effects of step changes in excitation from a steady state on the transient electric field and space charge behavior for unipolar ion conduction
 The general results of recent transient analysis for unipolar ion conduction are used to solve for the electric field, the space charge behavior and the time dependence of the terminal voltage for systems with an initial steady state space charge distribution for which the terminal current is instantaneously increased or decreased including opencircuit conditions. The initial condition transient is shown to be independent of the charge-emitter boundary condition. Representative boundary conditions considered are a field threshold condition, whereby charge injection occurs whenever the emitter electric field reaches a critical value, and a new boundary condition introduced here where the injected charge density is proportional to the emitter electric field corresponding to the case where the injected conduction current is proportional to the square of the emitter electric field. The analysis is useful for correlation with experimental measurements of ionic mobilities as well as bulk electro-optical measurements of electric field distributions. The open-circuit case is particularly valuable because it is easily experimentally arranged for turn-off conditions and can improve confidence in measurements originally made during the turn-on transient. Part II of this paper treats the analogous but more difficult case of step changes in terminal voltage.
Serotonin modulates the voltage dependence of delayed rectifier and Shaker potassium channels in drosophila photoreceptors
 We describe the in situ modulation of potassium channels in a semi-intact preparation of the Drosophila retina. In whole-cell recordings of photoreceptors, rapidly inactivating Shaker channels are characterized by a conspicuously negative voltage operating range; together with a delayed rectifier, these channels are specifically modulated by the putative efferent neurotransmitter serotonin. Contrary to most potassium channel modulations, serotonin induced a reversible positive shift in the voltage operating range, of +30 mV for the Shaker channels and +10–14 mV for the delayed rectifier. The maximal current amplitudes were unaffected. Modulation was not affected by the subunit-specific Shaker mutations fShE62 and T(1;Y)W32 or a null mutation of the putative modulatory subunit eag. The modulation of both channels was mimicked by intracellularly applied GTPγS.
Radiation hardness of electro-optic asymmetric Fabry-Perot modulators
 Analog optical links for LHC experiments are being developed, using electro-optical modulators as front-end transmitters. In the inner trackers, these devices will be subject to a harsh radiation environment, combining ionizing radiation and hadrons, up to 10 Mrads and 1014 (neutron-equivalent)/cm2, over the experiment lifetime. The radiation hardness of the Asymmetric Fabry-Perot Modulator (AFPM) has been tested, with both kinds of radiations, up to LHC total doses and fluences. Results confirm a radiation hardness which qualifies the AFPM for application in the detector front ends.
Sigma 1 receptor: A novel therapeutic target in retinal disease
 Retinal degenerative diseases are major causes of untreatable blindness worldwide and efficacious treatments for these diseases are sorely needed. A novel target for treatment of retinal disease is the transmembrane protein Sigma 1 Receptor (Sig1R). This enigmatic protein is an evolutionary isolate with no known homology to any other protein. Sig1R was originally thought to be an opioid receptor. That notion has been dispelled and more recent pharmacological and molecular studies suggest that it is a pluripotent modulator with a number of biological functions, many of which are relevant to retinal disease. This review provides an overview of the discovery of Sig1R and early pharmacologic studies that led to the cloning of the Sig1R gene and eventual elucidation of its crystal structure. Studies of Sig1R in the eye were not reported until the late 1990s, but since that time there has been increasing interest in the potential role of Sig1R as a target for retinal disease. Studies have focused on elucidating the mechanism(s) of Sig1R function in retina including calcium regulation, modulation of oxidative stress, ion channel regulation and molecular chaperone activity. Mechanistic studies have been performed in isolated retinal cells, such as Müller glial cells, microglial cells, optic nerve head astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells as well as in the intact retina. Several compelling studies have provided evidence of powerful in vivo neuroprotective effects against ganglion cell loss as well as photoreceptor cell loss. Also described are studies that have examined retinal structure/function in various models of retinal disease in which Sig1R is absent and reveal that these phenotypes are accelerated compared to retinas of animals that express Sig1R. The collective evidence from analysis of studies over the past 20 years is that Sig1R plays a key role in modulating retinal cellular stress and that it holds great promise as a target in retinal neurodegenerative disease.
Prior activity influences the velocity of impulses in frog and cat optic nerve fibers
 Under normal visual stimulation, simultaneous recording from ganglion cells in the retina and from the axons of these cells in the brain revealed activity-dependent differences in the velocity of impulse propagation. In frog ganglion cells, spikes initiated 5–500 ms after a previous impulse showed supernormal increases in conduction velocity of up to 17%; spikes initiated 500–2000 ms after a previous one traveled more slowly than a spike initiated after a long period of rest. Cat ganglion cell impulses showed much smaller supernormality (maximum 3%), but exhibited pronounced slowing due to refractoriness and long-term fatigue associated with their high levels of spontaneous activity.
Sensitivity of magneto-optic rotation to variations in isotopic composition
 The technique has the advantage of allowing isotopic differences to be detected using a standard atmospheric atomiser and a conventional hollow cathode source. The measurements are sufficiently robust to tolerate a limited variability of sample composition, background absorption from matrix species, and some instrumental parameters such as source intensity. Different isotopes show different responses with varying magnetic field strength across the atomiser. This allows a distinction to be made between the isotopes even though only a single source of natural isotopic composition is used. Results illustrating this behaviour are given for Pb206, Pb207, Pb208.
Human spectrin. V. A comparative electro-optic study of heterotetramers and heterodimers
 The electrically induced birefringence of human spectrin heterotetramer and heterodimer solutions at 5°C has been studied. 1.1. The steady-state birefringence, δ, was found to be approximately proportional to the electric field strength, E, when E ⩾ 0.2 kV/mm. For spectrin solutions the specific linear coefficient, δ/(E · c), therefore is a more relevant parameter for describing birefringence saturation behavior when E ⩾ 0.2 kV/mm than the commonly used Kerr constant. At 5°C we measured δ/(E · c) = (27 ± 5) · 10−8m4 · V−1 · kg−1 for heterodimers and heterotetramers.2.2. At 5°C both heterotetramers and heterodimers exhibited more than one birefringence relaxation time and the shortest of these was for both molecules found to be 4.2 ± 1.0 μs. This indicates that the spectrin molecules are highly flexible. The birefringence build-up time for heterotetramers and heterodimers was found to be 20 ± 7 μs and 15 ± 5 μs, respectively. 1.

Transient scattering from absorbing solutions
 Although light scattering has become a standard method for determining the geometric parameters of macromolecular solutes in solution, it has serious theoretical and experimental limitations when the solutions partly absorb the incident light. When subjected to pulsed electric fields, electrically anisotropic molecules orientate. This changes the scattered intensity. By making measurements of the relative scattered intensity changes as the molecules revert to a random array after the electric pulse has ceased, the molecular relaxation times, and hence the molecular dimensions, may be evaluated whether or not the material is absorbing. Typical measurements are made on vanadium pentoxide and benzopurpurine suspensions and tobacco mosaic virus solutions at a variety of wavelengths to demonstrate the method.
Tight coupling between the rate of rise of Ca2+ transient and peak twitch contraction in guinea-pig papillary muscle
 We evaluated the relationship between cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and force in guinea-pig papillary muscles loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-PE3. In the absence of ryanodine, [Ca2+]i transient and force were altered by changing extracellular Ca2+ concentration and stimulation frequency, and also by adding methyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyridine-5-carboxylate (Bay K 8644) or ouabain. Under these conditions, the peak force correlated linearly with the maximal rate of rise of [Ca2+]i (γ=0.948) more than the peak [Ca2+]i transient (γ=0.737). Ryanodine inhibited the increase in the maximal rate of rise of [Ca2+]i resulting in abolishment of the correlation between force and the maximal rate of rise of [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that the maximal rate of rise of [Ca2+]i reflects Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and this fraction of [Ca2+]i is crucial for determining the amplitude of twitch contractions when the sarcoplasmic reticulum is intact in guinea-pig papillary muscle.
Magic angle spinning NMR below 6 K with a computational fluid dynamics analysis of fluid flow and temperature gradients
 We report magic angle spinning (MAS) up to 8.5 kHz with a sample temperature below 6 K using liquid helium as a variable temperature fluid. Cross polarization 13C NMR spectra exhibit exquisite sensitivity with a single transient. Remarkably, 1H saturation recovery experiments show a 1H T1 of 21 s with MAS below 6 K in the presence of trityl radicals in a glassy matrix. Leveraging the thermal spin polarization available at 4.2 K versus 298 K should result in 71 times higher signal intensity. Taking the 1H longitudinal relaxation into account, signal averaging times are therefore predicted to be expedited by a factor of >500. Computer assisted design (CAD) and finite element analysis were employed in both the design and diagnostic stages of this cryogenic MAS technology development. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models describing temperature gradients and fluid flow are presented. The CFD models bearing and drive gas maintained at 100 K, while a colder helium variable temperature fluid stream cools the center of a zirconia rotor. Results from the CFD were used to optimize the helium exhaust path and determine the sample temperature. This novel cryogenic experimental platform will be integrated with pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization and electron decoupling to interrogate biomolecular structure within intact human cells.
Basal Forebrain and Brainstem Cholinergic Neurons Differentially Impact Amygdala Circuits and Learning-Related Behavior
 The central cholinergic system and the amygdala are important for motivation and mnemonic processes. Different cholinergic populations innervate the amygdala, but it is unclear how these projections impact amygdala processes. Using optogenetic circuit-mapping strategies in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-cre mice, we demonstrate that amygdala-projecting basal forebrain and brainstem ChAT-containing neurons can differentially affect amygdala circuits and behavior. Photo-activating ChAT terminals in vitro revealed the underlying synaptic impact of brainstem inputs to the central lateral division to be excitatory, mediated via the synergistic glutamatergic activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors. In contrast, stimulating basal forebrain inputs to the basal nucleus resulted in endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release, resulting in biphasic inhibition-excitation responses onto principal neurons. Such response profiles are physiological hallmarks of neural oscillations and could thus form the basis of ACh-mediated rhythmicity in amygdala networks. Consistent with this, in vivo basal forebrain ChAT+ activation strengthened amygdala basal nucleus theta and gamma frequency rhythmicity, both of which continued for seconds after stimulation and were dependent on local muscarinic and nicotinic receptor activation, respectively. Activation of brainstem ChAT-containing neurons, however, resulted in a transient increase in central lateral amygdala activity that was independent of cholinergic receptors. In addition, driving these respective inputs in behaving animals induced opposing appetitive and defensive learning-related behavioral changes. Because learning and memory are supported by both cellular and network-level processes in central cholinergic and amygdala networks, these results provide a route by which distinct cholinergic inputs can convey salient information to the amygdala and promote associative biophysical changes that underlie emotional memories.
Photoelectrical characterization of a new generation diode having GaFeO3 interlayer
 In this work, we have systematically investigated the effects of illumination intensity on the electrical characteristics of GaFeO3/p-Si heterostructure. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the heterostructure based on GaFeO3 thin film were performed in dark and under different illumination intensities. The photocurrent in the reverse biased I–V measurement is strongly sensitive to photo-illumination. The ideality factor (n) and zero-bias barrier height (Φb0) were found to be strongly illumination dependent and while Φb0 decreases, n increases with decreasing illumination. From capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics, it has been seen that the capacitance decreases as the frequency increases, exhibiting a continuous distribution of the interface states at frequency range 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The interface state density was determined by conductance method for dark conditions. It is believed that the combination of p-Si and thin GaFeO3 layer will provide new opportunities as a photodiode sensor for visible light sensor applications.
The effects of substrate layer thickness on piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting with a bimorph type cantilever
 In this research four piezoelectric bimorph type cantilevers for energy harvesting were manufactured, measured and analyzed to study the effects of substrate layer thickness on energy harvesting efficiency and durability under different accelerations. The cantilevers had the same dimensions of the piezoelectric ceramic components, but had different thicknesses of the steel substrate (no steel, 30 µm, 50 µm and 75 µm). The cantilevers were tuned to the same resonance frequency with different sizes of tip mass (2.13 g, 3.84 g, 4.17 g and 5.08 g). The energy harvester voltage outputs were then measured across an electrical load near to the resonance frequency (∼40 Hz) with sinusoidal vibrations under different accelerations. The stress exhibited by the four cantilevers was compared and analyzed and their durability was tested with accelerations up to 2.5 g-forces.
A novel thermal probe design for the measurement of energy influx in RF remote plasma
 A novel design of a thermal probe to measure the energy influx of RF plasma has been achieved. This probe utilises one-dimensional steady-state conduction through the probe's cylindrical body and has the ability of controlling its exposed surface's temperature. The probe is fully instrumented so that the temperature field within it is known. This temperature field will serve as an indicator of achieving steady-state conduction as well as securing the needed data to calculate the energy influx of the RF plasma. Experimental results show that the plasma energy influx varied from 0.3 kW/m² to 2.2 kW/m² for RF power ranging from 15 W to 300 W, respectively. The variation of the energy influx with the RF power was found to follow a linear profile and a simple relation is proposed to model this variation for the considered plasma. Error analysis has been carried out to estimate the experimental uncertainties in the resulting energy influx values. The resulting uncertainties are found to be within the acceptable range for such applications.
Hippocampal activity during transient respiratory events in the freely behaving cat
 We measured dorsal hippocampal activity accompanying sighs and apnea using reflectance imaging and electrophysiologic measures in freely behaving cats. Reflected 660-nm light from a 1-mm2 area of CA1 was captured during sighs and apnea at 25 Hz through a coherent image conduit coupled to a charge coupled device camera. Sighs and apnea frequently coincided with state transitions. Thus, state transitions without apnea or sighs were separately assessed to control for state-related activity changes. All dorsal hippocampal sites showed discrete regions of activation and inactivation during transient respiratory events. Imaged hippocampal activity increased 1–3 s before the enhanced inspiratory effort associated with sighs, and before resumption of breathing after apnea. State transitions lacking sighs and apnea did not elicit analogous optical activity patterns. The suprasylvian cortex, a control for site, showed no significant overall reflectance changes during phasic respiratory events, and no discrete regions of activation or inactivation. Spectral estimates of hippocampal electroencephalographic activity from 0–12 Hz showed significantly increased power at 3–4 Hz rhythmical slow activity before sighs and apnea, and increased 5–6 Hz rhythmical slow activity power during apnea, before resumption of breathing. Imaged activity and broadband hippocampal electroencephalogram power decreased during sighs. We propose that increased hippocampal activity before sigh onset and apnea termination indicates a role for the hippocampus in initiating inspiratory effort during transient respiratory events.
Fiber-coupled multiple-line infrared emission measurements to determine temperature, CO2, and H2O
 This paper presents the design of a custom fiber-based system designed to simultaneously monitor carbon dioxide and water column densities and line-of-sight averaged temperature. The system utilizes zirconium fluoride optical fibers to transmit infrared radiation (2–5μm) from high-temperature combustion effluent. Bandpass filters are used to separate emission from different species and optically thick emission from carbon dioxide is used to determine temperature. The temperature and molecule specific spectral profiles of the radiating gases, as well as atmospheric absorption, dictates high-resolution modeling of system radiation. Using this information, band models have been created that relate the net emissivity for a particular bandpass filter to the temperature and column densities of the flow field. Initial testing has been done on a methane burner; the ability to follow fluctuations for each constituent has been demonstrated. The band models have been used to reduce the flame radiance data for each filter; column density and temperature results from several flame conditions are reported.
Cocaine Inhibition of Synaptic Transmission in the Ventral Pallidum Is Pathway-Specific and Mediated by Serotonin
 The ventral pallidum (VP) is part of the basal ganglia circuitry and a target of both direct and indirect pathway projections from the nucleus accumbens. VP is important in cocaine reinforcement, and the firing of VP neurons is modulated in vivo during cocaine self-administration. This modulation of firing is thought to be indirect via cocaine actions on dopamine in the accumbens. Here, we show that cocaine directly inhibits synaptic transmission evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway projections to VP neurons. The inhibition is independent of dopamine receptor activation, absent in 5-HT1B knockout mice, and mimicked by a serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker. SERT-expressing neurons in dorsal raphe project to the VP. Optogenetic stimulation of these projections evokes serotonin transients and effectively inhibits GABAergic transmission to VP neurons. This study shows that cocaine increases endogenous serotonin in the VP to suppress synaptic transmission selectively from indirect pathway projections to VP neurons.
Chapter 2 Instrumentation for the measurement of circular dichroism; past, present and future developments
 The basic procedures for the measurement of circular dichroism were developed over 100 years ago. Over the past century, measurement advances have occurred in an incremental fashion as improvements have been made in the various instrumental components involved in the measurement process. One significant development has been the use of the photoelastic modulator for polarization modulation of the probing radiation. The PEM's large optical aperture, good stability, and ability to polarize the probing light with excellent purity has transformed the measurement of CD from a difficult experimental technique to a routine tool for the determination of complex structure. This capability has been extended to the time-dependent study of biological reactions through the association of the stopped-flow technique with the CD measurement. Recent advances have introduced the laser as the probe source allowing microvolume sampling and time-dependent CD studies in the nanosecond to picosecond regime. Finally, the introduction of multichannel light detection devices, for example, charge-coupled devices, into the CD experiment may have as dramatic an effect on the measurement of CD as the introduction of electro-optic polarization modulation had 30 years ago. Although several obstacles remain to be solved, preliminary results clearly demonstrate the advantages of this approach and these advantages will serve as an impetus for the future development and application of this technology to the measurement of CD.
Extracellular K+ concentration during electrical stimulation of rat isolated sympathetic ganglia, vagus and optic nerves
 Recordings of extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e) were made in rat isolated sympathetic ganglia, vagus and optic nerves using ion sensitive microelectrodes. Repetitive orthodromic stimulation of ganglia resulted in [K+]e increases of up to 7 mmol/1 above resting level (6 mmol/1), which were followed by post-stimulus undershoots. Activation of vagal A and B fibres did not significantly alter [K+]e but C-fibre activity induced rises of up to 5 mmol/1. Repetitive stimulation of the predominantly mylinated optic nerve resulted in [K+]e rises of up to 2.5 mmol/1. In the ganglion and vagus nerve, application of ouabain (30–1000 μmol/1) led to a raised baseline [K+]e concentration, an increase in the peak achieved during stimulation and a reduced undershoot amplitude. The amplitude of the undershoot in normal solution was shown to be dependent on the duration of the preceding stimulation period as well as the amplitude of the preceding [K+]e rise. In ganglia and vagus nerves, bath application of γ-aminobutyric acid (10–100μmol/1) and carbachol (10–1000 μmol/1) also elevated [K+]e. It is concluded that repetitive activity in rat peripheral and central nerve fibres leads to significant changes in extracellular K+ ion-concentration and that the restoration of these levels is strongly dependent on the intact activity of the membrane Na+/K+ pump.
Electrical Stimulation as a Means for Improving Vision
 Evolving research has provided evidence that noninvasive electrical stimulation (ES) of the eye may be a promising therapy for either preserving or restoring vision in several retinal and optic nerve diseases. In this review, we focus on minimally invasive strategies for the delivery of ES and accordingly summarize the current literature on transcorneal, transorbital, and transpalpebral ES in both animal experiments and clinical studies. Various mechanisms are believed to underlie the effects of ES, including increased production of neurotrophic agents, improved chorioretinal blood circulation, and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. Different animal models have demonstrated favorable effects of ES on both the retina and the optic nerve. Promising effects of ES have also been demonstrated in clinical studies; however, all current studies have a lack of randomization and/or a control group (sham). There is thus a pressing need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern clinical success and optimization of stimulation parameters in animal studies. In addition, such research should be followed by large, prospective, clinical studies to explore the full potential of ES. Through this review, we aim to provide insight to guide future research on ES as a potential therapy for improving vision.
Modeling radio frequency heating of granular foods: Individual particle vs. effective property approach
 Radio frequency (RF) heat treatment is one of the most promising methods for disinfestations and pasteurizations of granular foods but the combined effects of geometry and dielectric properties of granular materials on the non-uniformity of heating in RF are poorly understood. A coupled thermal-electromagnetic model for RF heating (27.12 MHz, parallel plate) of a single layer of spherical particles (1–5 cm diameter) was developed using two different formulations of the particles − an approach that considers the geometry of individual particles and a simplified approach that considers the effective properties of an air-particle mixture. The spherical particles, prepared from soybean powder, represented dry granular foods. Model predictions were validated using point and spatial temperature measurements. Results show that while an effective properties approach can be sufficient for smaller (∼1 cm diameter) particles (with internal temperature range of 3 °C), consideration of the exact geometry (individual particles) would be needed for accurate prediction of heating non-uniformities (with internal temperature range of 39 °C) in larger diameters (diameter of 5 cm). Heating non-uniformities are present due to corner/edge heating, focusing effect, as well as contact heating between particles or between a particle and the tray. Results should greatly benefit computer-aided design and optimization of RF heating processes for granular products.
Acoustic, Electromagnetic and Optical Sensing and Monitoring Methods
 Due to capabilities of transmission in underground, a brief introduction on underground measurement methods by adopting kinds of “wave” (including field wave, acoustic wave, and electromagnetic wave) is presented. Among them, acoustical measurement methods are the most widely used in practical applications. Hence, some typical acoustical measurement methods are introduced with more details, from their principles to application examples. Electrical and electromagnetic methods are also widely adopted and more traditional methods in geological exploration and subsurface structure detection are described. Several routine approaches and their applications are exhibited, too. While, in practical applications, how to sense the “waves” in rugged measurement environment is another important issue. Due to the presence of many extra benefits in “waves” sensing compared to traditional methods, optical sensing techniques are summarized and introduced with their application examples. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology for detecting, locating, and inspecting objects or structures buried underneath ground surface. It is also applicable to detect objects behind walls or other dielectric barriers. In this chapter, the operating mechanism of GPR is explained. Moreover, the GPR circuit design, signal processing, and applications are presented.
Development of a deep-sea laser-induced breakdown spectrometer for in situ multi-element chemical analysis
 Spectroscopy is emerging as a technique that can expand the envelope of modern oceanographic sensors. The selectivity of spectroscopic techniques enables a single instrument to measure multiple components of the marine environment and can form the basis for versatile tools to perform in situ geochemical analysis. We have developed a deep-sea laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (ChemiCam) and successfully deployed the instrument from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to perform in situ multi-element analysis of both seawater and mineral deposits at depths of over 1000 m. The instrument consists of a long-nanosecond duration pulse-laser, a spectrometer and a high-speed camera. Power supply, instrument control and signal telemetry are provided through a ROV tether. The instrument has two modes of operation. In the first mode, the laser is focused directly into seawater and spectroscopic measurements of seawater composition are performed. In the second mode, a fiber-optic cable assembly is used to make spectroscopic measurements of mineral deposits. In this mode the laser is fired through a 4 m long fiber-optic cable and is focused onto the target’s surface using an optical head and a linear stage that can be held by a ROV manipulator. In this paper, we describe the instrument and the methods developed to process its measurements. Exemplary measurements of both seawater and mineral deposits made during deployments of the device at an active hydrothermal vent field in the Okinawa trough are presented. Through integration with platforms such as underwater vehicles, drilling systems and subsea observatories, it is hoped that this technology can contribute to more efficient scientific surveys of the deep-sea environment.
The messages in optic nerve fibers and their interpretation
 Spike discharges are the principal carriers of information in the nervous system. Although both the ionic and the molecular mechanisms of spike generation have been studied extensively, the methods for analyzing a spike train that are currently employed have not changed much from those in use 20 years ago. There is an apparent need for a refinement of the methods used to analyze spike trains. We present here a summary of our recent results of an analysis of spike trains from retinal ganglion cells that is based on Wiener's theory of non-linear analysis or white-noise analysis. We found that spike trains carry, at least to a second-order approximation, as much information as is carried by the ganglion cell's postsynaptic potential (PSP). There is no loss of information when an analog signal, PSP, is converted into a point process, namely, spike discharges. It is indeed possible to predict the cell's PSP from a spike train. This finding has two important implications. First, the neuron network in the retina produces a PSP, the dynamics of which are optimal for triggering a spike discharge, or conversely, the spike-generation mechanism is optimized to match the dynamics of the network. The external stimulus that is optimal for production of a ganglion-cell discharge is represented as the cell's PSP. Second, there is structure encoded within the spike train; information on a second-order non-linearity is encoded by the relative timing of two consecutive spike discharges. Coding of non-linearity into a spike train is an efficient means of signal compression and is an important aspect of neurophysiology.
A selection of new developments in multiphase flow measurement techniques
 The use of numerical modeling for the design and analysis of complex multiphase flow systems requires a good understanding of fundamental effects such as phase separation, transient behavior, and constitutive relationships for the interfacial transport of mass, heat, and momentum for different flow regime Experimental studies of these phenomena are greatly enhanced through the availability of new sensors and instrumentation. An overview of the last decade of development in experimental techniques and methods used to study multiphase flow is provided and the application of these techniques is illustrated for the measurement of, for example, phase velocity, temperature, flow regimes, and void fraction. The techniques and methods described are also combined in a table, which includes the measured or estimated experimental uncertainty.
A study of distributed embedded thermal monitoring in electric coils based on FBG sensor multiplexing
 This paper reports the design of an embedded FBG sensing system aimed at facilitating real-time distributed internal thermal conditions monitoring in wound coils of electric machines. The proposed system utilizes the multiplexing property of FBG sensors to achieve multipoint distributed thermal monitoring in arbitrary points within the coil structure. The sensing system architecture and operating features are discussed and its performance evaluated in laboratory tests on prototype coils operated in representative static and dynamic thermal conditions. The findings demonstrate that the presented system is capable of reliable real-time monitoring of coil internal thermal conditions and provides a versatile platform that can be expanded and modified to cater for arbitrary coil geometries and designs, and enables a much improved understanding of key thermal operating conditions. The presented results set a base for further research on the integration of the reported embedded sensing architecture with dedicated real-time computing and power control resources to develop novel closed-loop thermal management systems for electric coils and machines and improve their utilization.
Electric field-induced transient birefringence and light scattering of synthetic liposomes
 The dynamics of electric field-induced transient birefringence Δn(t) and light scattering (detected as turbidity) of 190 nm diameter unilamellar vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine are investigated as a function of applied field strength E, length of the square pulse Δt, lipid concentration, mean hydrodynamic diameter 〈Dh〉, ionic strength, and temperature. Generally, induced birefringence exclusively is observed at low lipid concentration and below certain threshold values of E and Δt, whereas concomitant induced turbidity appears at high lipid concentration and above thresholds values of E and Δt. Turbidity is monitored through the change in transmitted intensity ΔS‖(t) and ΔS⊥(t) of light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the applied field E. The field-induced structural changes are reflected in double-exponential forward relaxation and triple-exponential reverse relaxation of the positive birefringence, and in non-exponential relaxations of ΔS‖(t) and ΔS⊥(t). Under the field, the associated physical events are interpreted as elongation of the spherical bilayer shells in the direction of E, linear chain formation (pearling) of the induced dipolar liposomes parallel to E, and partial fusion of adjoining vesicles within the chains. Under conditions where electroporation can be detected, pore opening succeeds the elongation of the vesicles. After termination of the field, the vesicles return to their original time average spherical shape, the oriented chains randomize and disintegrate, and the fused structures are converted either to unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles.
New photonic and electronic polymers
 This paper gives an overview of recent work on new organic π-electron-conjugated materials prepared and tested in our laboratories. Second-order nonlinear optical polymers for electro-optic modulation were investigated, both guest–host and side-chain chromophoric materials. Chromophores and polymers were synthesized, thin films were prepared, and the following properties were measured: electro-optic coefficient, optical absorption loss and thermal stability. It was concluded that optical modulators fabricated from these materials could be viable components in optical communication systems. Work on novel polyphenylenevinylenes is summarized. Besides their low electrical resistivity, photoluminescent, and electro-active properties, these materials have interesting photoconductive properties that may prove useful in optical control of photonic logic devices.
Measuring temperature distributions during microwave processing
 Microwave ovens are commonplace in households and are established there as devices of everyday use. While microwaves are used in the food industry, e.g., for pasteurization, it is still a technology that hasn’t seen the uptake one would expect from such a versatile technology. Microwave heating has been proposed as an alternative for traditional heating methods for several decades for a number of food manufacturing processes, and while their objectives differ, the aims are established in all applications through an increase of temperature. Where the process has a preservation function, as in pasteurization, sterilization, and drying, it is critical to reach a minimum time–temperature treatment or a target water content. In other processes, temperatures should remain below thresholds to achieve a desired product quality with a maximum preservation of color, flavor, among other quality attributes. A number of microwave intrinsic factors lead to the development of uneven heating patterns, e.g., through focusing effects, corner and edge heating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field distributions, or in particular the shape and the composition of the heated material. As a consequence, heating patterns can differ significantly from one product to another and, therefore, in industrial microwave processes the quality and safety of the products can be compromised, and care needs to be taken to ensure sufficient heating uniformity. It is largely for the reason of nonuniformity and associated issues with respect to food safety and quality, that microwave processes have not been adopted widely in the food industry. To optimize microwave processes and their impact on food safety and quality, it is essential to understand the temperature distributions throughout the heated products. This chapter will discuss methods that can be used to measure temperatures in microwave field, and outline their respective benefits and drawbacks. The methodologies covered include thermocouples, fiber-optic probes, infrared thermography, microwave radiometry, temperature indicators, and magnetic resonance imaging.
The dynamical admittance spectrometer: Instrument development and its application to chemical kinetics
 According to the intrinsic characteristics of the admittance spectrum, its application to kinetic research possesses some advantages. So in this report, based on the virtual instrument technology and infinitesimal principle, one dynamic admittance spectrometer was developed and primarily applied to the research of chemical kinetics. The hardware configuration mainly included five parts: signal generator, chemical system container, amplification circuit, data collecting circuit, the host computer and its application program. In order to realize the real-time dynamical test, two methods could be adopted, which were frequency response and time response (namely impulse response). It could be seen that the two methods were almost same for the chemical reaction system in this report. When the instrument was established, the measurement error of the instrument was tested through the matured commercial electrochemical workstation. It could be easily found that our dynamical spectrometer was better than the electrochemical workstation. Because the chemical reaction was continuous changing system, the infinitesimal principle was used to dynamical measurement. For the sucrose hydrolyzation system under acid, the time length for one infinitesimal was determined to be one second by experiments. Thanks to the characteristics of admittance, the catalyst hydrochloric acid was highly conducting and with little capacitance value, but the other reactants are highly insulating and with little conductance value. So when measuring capacitance value to represent the concentration of the reactants, the testing error can be ignored. Then the standard capacitance–concentration curve could be obtained. From the dynamically testing results and the standard capacitance–concentration curve, the function relationship between concentration of sucrose and reaction time could be obtained. At last, the kinetic equation of hydrolyzation of sucrose under HCl could be determined to be r=-d[sucrose]dt=kcSU1cHCl1.46, with total reacting order of 2.46.
Measurement techniques for piston-ring tribology
 This chapter reviews experimental methods that have been used to study various aspects of the tribology of piston rings in operating internal combustion engines. The discussion covers methods used to determine the thickness of the lubricating film between the ring and the cylinder wall, the axial and angular position of the ring within the ring groove, ring wear, piston assembly friction, ring zone temperatures, lubricant flow through the ring pack, the condition of the lubricant around the ring groove and oil consumption through mechanisms associated with ring pack lubrication.
Simulation and evaluation of pilot-scale pulsed electric field (PEF) processing
 Pulsed electric field (PEF) processing is a novel mild treatment for pumpable foods preservation at low or moderate temperatures. The electric field strength and the temperature distribution in the treatment chamber have been identified as the key processing parameters affecting the treatment efficacy and possibly the sensorial and nutritional quality of the food. A full 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a pilot-scale PEF system with co-linear configuration of the electrodes was developed. The model couples the fluid dynamics and the electrical field and can be used to predict the liquid’s flow pattern, electric field distribution, temperature increase, and residence time in the treatment chamber. A total of 48 process conditions with different settings of applied voltage V, pulse length τ, pulse repetition rate (frequency) f and flow rate V˙ in combination with four different inlet temperatures were simulated for a model liquid food (NaCl solutions with two different electrical conductivities) and whole milk. The simulated PEF energy dissipated into the liquids was between 4 and 66 kJ/kg and process temperatures ranged from approximately 25 to 80 °C. The predicted temperature data agree well (R2 > 0.99) with experimental measurements in five locations of the treatment chamber using fibre optic probes.
Centrifugal optic nerve responses evoked by auditory and somatic stimulation
 The evidence for the efferent control of receptor events has recently been repeatedly challenged. The present experiments were undertaken to provide a simple demonstration of the existence of such a mechanism. Clicks were presented to unanesthetized cats and bipolar recordings made of potential changes evoked in the optic nerve and tract with implants of small (300 μ spaced about 0.2 mm) electrode wires. Click initiated optic nerve responses of 10–60 μv amplitude were obtained in fourteen cats at a latency of 20 msec. These responses were unaffected by atropinization or by curarization; they showed amplitude decrement upon repeated presentations and were unobtainable when the animal was restless. They were abolished by bilateral section of the optic tracts central to the implant sites. Similar optic nerve responses could be initiated by tactile stimulation. Also, silent flash produced recordable responses in the eighth cranial nerve. Finally, parametric click-flash interaction effects were observed to differentially affect different fibers in the optic nerve and to alter the B wave of the ERG.
Decentralized Fiber Optic Acquisition System
 The paper describes a decentralized data acquisition system installed for a long term on-site test at a French power plant. Two local autonomous stations acquire the information from 24 channels ; the data are continuously transmitted to a concentrator through two 600 m long optical cables at a rate of 0.96 Mbits/sec.. An error ratio lower than 10” on transmission, made possible through the use of optical fiber, allows testing to be performed in an industrial environment using only very simple error detection technique. The optical cables which follow interchangeable paths inside and outside the station, and operate in a temperature range of between -20°C and +60°C, are operational transmission media, which, during testing on large sites, eliminate the constraints related to the location of central computer facilities.
Quality assurance in microwave food processing and the enabling potentials of solid-state power generators: A review
 The widespread deployment of microwaves in domestic, commercial and industrial food processing operations, necessitates quality assurance. This review critically assesses key microwaved-food quality assurance issues such as process lethality, product degradation mechanisms, non-uniform heating and volumetric temperature sensing. Non-uniform heating, the root-cause of quality assurance problems, is shown to have negative consequences on process energy consumption, and linked to the poor controllability of conventional microwave power sources, magnetrons. A case is therefore made for the use of solid-state generators as alternative power sources by a cost-benefit analysis, which includes energy and reliability aspects. The feasibility of a paradigm shift to solid-state power delivery in the development of smart processing systems, is shown, and potential commercialisation opportunities, identified.
HVDC Transmission
 High voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is a major user of power electronics technology. The cost of a transmission line comprises of the capital investment required for the actual infrastructure and costs incurred for operational requirements. The power transfer in an ac line is dependent on the angular difference between the voltage phasors at the two line ends. For a given power transfer level, this angle increases with distance. The maximum power transfer is limited by the considerations of steady state and transient stability. Voltage control in ac lines is complicated by the line charging requirements and voltage drops. The voltage profile in an ac line is relatively flat only for a fixed level of power transfer, corresponding to its surge impedance loading (SIL). Line compensation is necessary for long distance ac transmission to overcome the problems of line charging and stability limitations. Modern HVDC systems incorporate complex control and protection features. The testing and optimization of these features require powerful tools that are capable of modeling all facets of the system and have the flexibility to do the evaluation in a rapid, effective, and cost efficient manner.
Transient energy transfer between writing beams during hologram formation in Bi12GeO20
 A large transient energy transfer between writing beams during volume phase-hologram formation in Bi12GeO20 has been observed. The variation of the energy transfer by applying an external field and by changing the fringe spacing of the elementary holograms have been measured and described in the framework of Kukhtarevs nonlinear theory of transient self-diffraction. The results indicate that the transient energy transfer in Bi12GeO20 is due to a non-stationary phase mismatch between the intensity- and refractive index grating caused by photoconductivity and that the transient energy transfer increases with increasing fringe spacing and increasing applied electric field. Up to ten-fold amplification of coherent beams has been measured, corresponding to an exponential gain of Г = 2 cm-1. A continuous energy transfer has been observed when the phase between recording beams was changed linearly with time during recording. It is shown that light is coherently amplified for electric field strengths larger than 2.3 kV/cm and that a peak amplification factor of Г1 = 2 cm-1 has been reached for E0 = 11 kV/cm.
Chapter 3 Picosecond Photoconductivity: High-Speed Measurements of Devices and Materials
 This chapter discusses the concept of subpicosecond optical technology and high-speed photoconducting materials that generates and measures extremely fast electrical pulses. Many materials are used for picosecond photoconductors. The key properties of semiconductor materials can be divided into the intrinsic, impurity-dominated, radiation-damaged, polycrystalline, and amorphous semiconductors. The chapter also discusses the applications of ultrafast optoelectronics for the generation and measurement of ultrafast electrical transients, including microwave, millimeter wave, and far-infrared generation and detection. The speed of response of conventional electronic devices is currently limited to approximately 5 ps. Optoelectronics, however, has a capability of making measurements with time resolution below one picosecond. In this range, the most important applications are the characterization of the properties of materials. Because optoelectronics gives jitter-free phase coherent measurements, the frequency response can be directly deduced from the temporal response. For characterization of materials, optoelectronics provides measurements over an extremely broad range of frequencies from direct current to submillimeter waves.
Influence of ischemia on [Ca2+]i transients following drug therapy in hearts from aortic constricted rats
 Intracellular calcium transients were studied prior, during and after 30 min of global ischemia in control and aortic constricted rat hearts, with and without acute treatment with verapamil. Calcium transients [Ca2+]i continued to occur in verapamil treated animals for 18–20 min following the onset of global ischemia, whereas untreated hearts demonstrated calcium transients for only 3–8 min following global ischemia. Following the onset of global ischemia calcium transients continued to occur even though there was no measurable developed pressure. When calcium transients occurred for shorter periods of time during global ischemia the rise in diastolic calcium was greater and recovery was less. Addition of bradykinin to the perfusate showed that an increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i was related to a decrease in amplitude of developed [Ca2+]i transients and a decrease in developed pressure, but not to a change in coronary flow.
Enhanced photorefractive performance of bulk cu-doped KNSBN crystals through surface electrostatic modification
 The remarkable photorefractivity enhancement was observed and investigated in copper-doped (K0.5Na0.5)0.2(Sr0.75Ba0.25)0.9Nb2O6 (Cu:KNSBN) crystals due to charge accumulation on the surface, stemming from electrostrictive effect. This electrostatic modification to the surface was studied with conventional two beam coupling experiment and over 17 high diffraction orders were observed. To estimate the amount of charge accumulation, the surface charge density was measured through direct current measurement using a close loop circuit. It was believed that a thin phase grating was responsible for the diffraction pattern, which was confirmed by the related reading experiment. Corresponding calculation and analysis were given to highlight the strong refractive index modulation of the gratings.
Stimulus-induced extracellular pH transients in the in vitro turtle cerebellum
 In a number of CNS preparations, neuronal activation has been shown to result in a rapid extracellular alkaline transient, followed by a prolonged acid shift. The isolated turtle cerebellum was used to investigate the early alkaline transient. Double-barreled ion-sensitive microelectrodes for H+, K+ and tetramethylammonium were used to measure field potentials and extracellular ion and volume shifts in response to bipolar electrical stimulation of the parallel fibers. Transition from 15 mM HEPES to 35 mM HCO3− -buffered Ringer decreased the amplitude of the alkaline shift, presumably due to a marked increase in extracellular buffering power. In HEPES-buffered Ringer, repetitive stimulation produced alkaline shifts as large as 0.3–0.4 pH. Single shocks produced an alkaline shift of 0.006 ± 0.0002 pH with a latency as short as 70ms. Kynurenic acid (an excitatory amino acid antagonist), or Mn2+, blocked the alkaline shift and the postsynaptic component of the field potential. The alkaline shift was not blocked by the Na-H exchange inhibitor amiloride. The relationship between pHo and extracellular volume transients was studied using tetramethylammonium as an extracellular volume indicator. In nominally HCO3−free Ringer, stimulation at 5 Hz for 10 s caused a decrease in extracellular volume of 3.0 ± 0.2 per cent. The volume transient was unaffected by 3 mM Mn2+, while the alkaline shift was completely abolished. The data for the alkaline shift are consistent with a channel-mediated transmembrane flux of proton equivalents. The size of the pH change and the underlying perturbation it represents, indicate that acid-base shifts may be a functionally important consequence of neuronal activity.
Comparison of performance and optoelectronic processes in ZnO and TiO2 nanorod array-based hybrid solar cells
 The reported efficiencies of pristine ZnO nanorod array (NRA)-based polymer-inorganic hybrid solar cells (HSCs) are normally lower than those of their pristine TiO2 NRA-based counterparts. This difference typically results from the lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the ZnO NRA device. This paper presents a comparative study of pristine ZnO and TiO2 NRA-based HSCs. We investigate the morphological structure (length, diameter, number density, area of nanorod laterals), photovoltaic performance (current density-voltage J–V, external quantum efficiency EQE), and optoelectronic processes related to electron transfer (electron mobility μe, electron diffusion length LD, electron lifetime τe and electron transit time τt related electron collecting efficiency ηcc, electron injection ηinj, surface potential SP, photoluminescence PL, bound charge pairs BCP) in HSCs, with ZnO and TiO2 NRA as electron acceptor. Our comparative investigations reveal that the factors relating to the interface area, μe, LD, and ηcc are not the key factors responsible for the difference in the value of Jsc in ZnO and TiO2 NRA-based HSCs with the same device structure. In fact, the crucial step for a lower Jsc in ZnO NRA-based HSCs than in TiO2 NRA-based HSCs is attributed to the less efficient transfer of photo-generated electrons at the charge separation interface in ZnO NRA-based HSCs. Dynamic characterizations indicate that the transfer of interfacial photo-generated electrons in TiO2 NRA-based HSCs is more efficient than ZnO NRA-based HSCs, and is confirmed by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and PL studies. The reason for the better interface charge transfer property in MEH-PPV/TiO2 NRA than that of in MEH-PPV/ZnO NRA is further investigated by Marcus model, we find that more trapped BCP states are generated in the ZnO NRA based HSCs, which resulting in lower interfacial electron injection efficiency from polymer to ZnO NRA.
Voltage-gated sodium currents in isolated retinal ganglion cells of the cat: relation between the inactivation kinetics and the cell type
 Ganglion cells in the cat retina were retrogradely labeled by injecting a fluorescent dye (DiI) into either the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the superior colliculus (SC). Cells were then dissociated enzymatically from the retinal tissue. LGN-projecting ganglion cells consisted of 2 different populations, one with small and the other with large somata, which were identified as W and X cells, respectively. SC-projecting cells consisted of a single group of cells with small somata, identified as W cells. The voltage-gated sodium current (INa) was recorded from isolated ganglion cells under the voltage-clamp condition using a patch pipette in the whole cell configuration. INa was identified by reversible tetrodotoxin block. INa was activated by depolarization of the cell from the holding potential (Vh) of −95 mV to membrane voltages (Vm) more positive than −45 mV. The maximum INa was recorded at around −15 mV. INa flowed outward at Vm more positive than +65 mV. The reversal potential of INa became more negative voltages with low extracellular Na concentration ([Na+]0) with a relation of 58 mV for a 10-fold change in [Na+]0. INa was inactivated within a few milliseconds. Once inactivated, INa recovered by holding the cell membrane hyperpolarized. While the voltage dependence of INa activation and steady-state inactivation were constant from cell to cell, the time course of recovery was not. Cells with a large soma showed a rapid recovery, while cells with a small soma showed slow recovery. Thus, the rate of recovery is faster for X cells than for W cells. Perhaps this helps to explain the ‘sluggish’ firing of the latter cell type.
Sensor data acquisition systems and architectures
 This chapter describes key topics in the design and operation of conventional data acquisition systems used for structural health monitoring. These systems are discussed by four sub-system modules: (1) the sensor module, which consists of the physical element(s) that interact with the system-under-test to sense the physical process(es) and convert that information into a detectable signal form (e.g., an electrical voltage); (2) the signal conditioning module, which may have any number of functions, which could be further subdivided into analog functions (voltage amplification, some types of filtering, and possibly telemetry) and digital functions (timekeeping, digitization, triggering, master control); (3) the output module, which provides an actual indication, in an appropriate form, of the measurement(s) desired; and (4) the control module, which contains some form of an active controller that interprets the output and feeds back that information to an actuator that can manipulate the physical process (only present in active sensing systems). In the discussion of each module, the relevant hardware and signal processing components that comprise its operation and function are described, and the chapter concludes with a short summary of key concepts and observation of trends in data acquisition for structural health monitoring.
Electrophysiological properties of neurons recorded intracellularly in slices of the pigeon optic tectum
 The electrical properties of pigeon's optic tectum neurons located in the non-retinorecipient region of layer II have been studied in in vitro slice preparations by using intracellular recordings. As judged from the somatodendritic characteristics of cells intracellularly labeled with horseradish peroxidase recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons, the main morphological type, as well as from ganglion cells. When stimulated with depolarizing current pulses of 300–500 ms duration, three distinct modes of firing were observed. Most neurons (Type I) responded with a continuous firing of fast action potentials whose frequency rate increased regularly when current strength was raised. Another group of cells (Type II) also exhibited sustained firing. However, in Type II cells, grouped discharges formed by 2–6 fast action potentials per group fired in rapid succession were elicited within a certain range of current intensity. Finally, another group of cells (Type III) responded at all intensities tested by a short train of fast action potentials only at the onset of the current step. At current strength close to threshold the spike undershoot of type I neurons was followed by a slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential while the spike undershoot of Type II cells was followed by a hump-like depolarization and a slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential. In Type II cells, we have also observed a pronounced increase of the hyperpolarizing afterpotential after a grouped discharge. Type III cells were characterized by a small amplitude and short duration hyperpolarizing afterpotential, barely visible in most of them. In Type I and II cells the slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential was blocked by replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+ or Cd2+ in the saline. These results support the idea that in these two types of neurons the slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential is primarily caused by a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance. Furthermore, blocking the slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential provoked a pronounced increase of the firing frequency of Type I cells. In Type II cells blockade of the slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential had a greater effect on firing behavior: i.e. when Ca2+ was replaced with Mg2+ or Cd2+, Type II neurons exhibited repetitively fired action potentials at high frequency but were incapable of discharging repetitive grouped discharges. These observations indicate that the Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance involved in the generation of the slow hyperpolarizing afterpotential is the main modulator of the firing behavior of both types of cells. On the contrary, in Type III cells removal of Ca2+ from the bath had no effect either on the firing frequency or in the duration of the train of spikes. The present study also demonstrates that pigeon's tectal neurons are capable of generating action potentials corresponding not only to those arising from a sodium conductance but also to those arising from a low threshold calcium conductance.
Generation and measurement of pulsed high magnetic field
 Pulsed magnetic field has been generated by discharging a capacitor bank through a 5-layer air-core solenoid. The strength of the magnetic field at its peak has been measured using the voltage induced in various pick-up coils, and also from the Zeeman splitting of an ion having a known g value. Synchronizing a xenon flash at the peak of the magnetic field, this lab-made instrument has been made well suited to study the Zeeman effect, etc. at a temperature of 25 K. As an application of this setup, we have investigated the Zeeman splitting of the 4I9/2→4G5/2 transition of the Nd3+-doped CsCdCl3 crystal at 7.8 T, and determined the splitting factors.
Distributed multi-agent scheme for reactive power management with renewable energy
 This paper presents a new distributed multi-agent scheme for reactive power management in smart coordinated distribution networks with renewable energy sources (RESs) to enhance the dynamic voltage stability, which is mainly based on controlling distributed static synchronous compensators (DSTATCOMs). The proposed control scheme is incorporated in a multi-agent framework where the intelligent agents simultaneously coordinate with each other and represent various physical models to provide information and energy flow among different physical processes. The reactive power is estimated from the topology of distribution networks and with this information, necessary control actions are performed through the proposed proportional integral (PI) controller. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on a 8-bus distribution network under various operating conditions. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated through simulation results and these results are compared to that of conventional PI-based DSTATCOM control scheme. From simulation results, it is found that the distributed MAS provides excellence performance for improving voltage profiles by managing reactive power in a smarter way.
Intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin reduce transiently expressed acetylcholinesterase activity in developing rat visual cortex
 Geniculo-recipient layers of primary visual cortex in the rat display a transient pattern of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity during the second postnatal week of life. Previous work has demonstrated that neonatal enucleations markedly reduce the transient AChE activity in visual cortex. The present studies were undertaken to determine the effects of reduced afferent neural activity on expression of the transient pattern of AChE activity. Rat pups received intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) on postnatal days (PND) 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 and were sacrificed on PND 12. Some animals were enucleated on PND 3. Brain sections were processed for AChE histochemistry and analyzed by optical densitometry. These experiments show that uniocular injections result in a markedly decreased level of AChE activity in layer IV of the medial part of cortical area 17 contralateral to the injected eye. The degree of reduction of AChE activity from repeated TTX injections was similar to the degree of reduction following enucleation on PND 3. Binocular injections of TTX result in a reduction of AChE activity in layer IV throughout cortical area 17, similar to the effects of binocular enucleation on PND 3. Experiments combining injection of horseradish peroxidase along with TTX on PND 11 demonstrate that retinal ganglion cells of TTX injected eyes are still capable of anterograde axonal transport. These data demonstrate that normal innervation and afferent activity are necessary for the transient expression of AChE activity by geniculocortical neurons.
Optical characterizations of YCa4O(BO3)3 and Nd:YCa4O(BO3)3 crystals
 We report a complete optical characterization of YCa4O(BO3)3 and Nd:YCa4O(BO3)3 crystals. We studied the relative orientation between the dielectric and the crystallographic frames as a function of the wavelength and performed accurate phase-matching angles measurements for second harmonic generation, using a single crystal cut as a sphere. We also recorded polarized luminescence spectra of Nd:YCOB along the principal axes of the dielectric frame. For both crystals, we measured the gray-tracking and the thermo-optic properties as a function of temperature and wavelength using oriented slabs. Finally, we measured all their dielectric and electro-optic coefficients, as a function of frequency and wavelength.
[25] Development and application of caged ligands for neurotransmitter receptors in transient kinetic and neuronal circuit mapping studies
 This chapter describes the instrumentation and theory involved in transient kinetic investigations of neurotransmitter receptor-mediated reactions on the surface of nervous system cells and in the membranes of Xenopus laevis oocytes in which many receptors have been expressed. Photolabile, biologically inert precursors of neurotransmitters (caged neurotransmitters) that can be photolyzed to the neurotransmitters in the microsecond time region form an integral part of the transient kinetic techniques. The use of these techniques was illustrated in investigations of the formation of transmembrane channels, receptor-drug interactions, and integration of excitatory and inhibitory signals by single central nervous system neuron that have temporal and spatial information. The use of caged neurotransmitters in identifying cells that contain a specific receptor and cells that secrete the neurotransmitter in a circuit of cells controlling a measurable response has also been illustrated in the chapter.
Experimental evaluation of urban heat island mitigation potential of retro-reflective pavement in urban canyons
 Retro-reflective (RR) materials have been studied as a potential mitigation technology for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, thanks to their ability to reflect the radiation towards the same incoming direction. In this paper, the positive effect of RR pavements on the energy kept inside the canyon was studied on a physical model that represents an urban canyon layout. The performance of RR materials was compared to that of white and beige traditional cool diffusive materials in the spectral range of the incoming radiation from 360 to 1100 nm. The objective was the evaluation of the albedo over the canyon’s lid, so that also the optic interaction between pavement and façades was taken into account. In addition, the RR cooling effect, defined as the ratio between RR and diffusive reflected energies which remain inside the canyon, was calculated for the small-scale canyon scenario and the related analytical model was experimentally verified. The results show a cooling potential of the RR material with respect to the white and the beige diffusive materials, with a maximum albedo increase of 4.6%. The cooling ratio, calculated comparing RR with the beige diffusive sample with similar global reflectance, is equal to 0.37, showing a significant decrease of the energy kept inside the urban canyon.
Effects of excitation rise-time and charge injection conditions on the transient field and charge behavior for unipolar conduction
 Recent analysis using a unipolar ion mobility conduction model is continued and extended by taking into account the experimental realities of excitation rise-time and charge injection threshold conditions. The transient behavior of the bulk electric field and space charge distributions as a function of time and position as well as the resulting time dependence of the terminal voltage and current are found for an imposed voltage or current excitation with non-zero rise-time, contrasting the behavior between field or charge specification at the emitter electrode with charge injection onset once the emitter electric field exceeds a threshold value. Representative plots of field and charge distributions as well as voltage and current time dependence for various excitations, rise-times, and boundary conditions are presented. Important time constants which can be correlated to experiments under these various conditions are tabulated and where possible, results are presented in closed form.
Terahertz-field-induced second-harmonic generation measurements of liquid dynamics
 A new third-order non-linear THz pump–optical probe measurement of liquid dynamics is reported. Terahertz-field-induced second-harmonic generation (TFISH) measures the correlations between the hyperpolarizability and dipole moment fluctuations at equilibrium. This method is analyzed in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, and is shown to measure diffusive orientational dynamics as 〈P1(cos θ)〉. Measurements of water and acetonitrile yield relaxation time constants of 13 and 9.6 ps, respectively. Signals were also obtained from thin polymer films and surfaces, suggesting a number of applications for this method.
Cables
 The selection of cables for particular applications is best done with reference to the latest and specific manufacturer's cable data and application guides. This chapter concentrates on the properties of different types of low voltage (LV), medium voltage (MV), and high voltage (HV) power cables, their merits for different applications, cable sizing and loss calculations, useful installation practices, and cable management systems. It focuses on control and communication (C&C), including fiber optic cables. Technical specification details are included such that competitive quotations from leading manufacturers may be obtained. Consideration is given to the safety implications associated with gases and smoke emitted from cables under fire conditions, especially where installed in public places. There are certain factors that govern the design of power cables. The cross-sectional area of the conductors chosen should be of the optimum size to carry the specified load current or short circuit short term current without overheating and should be within the required limits for voltage drop, the insulation applied to the cable must be adequate for continuous operation at the specified working voltage with a high degree of thermal stability, safety, and reliability. All materials used in the construction must be carefully selected to ensure a high level of chemical and physical stability throughout the life of the cable in the selected environment. The cable must be mechanically strong and sufficiently flexible to withstand the re-drumming operations in the manufacturer's works, handling during transport, or when the cable is installed by direct burial, in trenches, pulled into ducts or laid on cable racks. Adequate external mechanical and/or chemical protection must be applied to the insulation and metal or outer sheathing to enable it to withstand the required environmental service conditions.
Membrane-proximal calcium transients in stimulated neutrophils detected by total internal reflection fluorescence
 A novel fluorescence microscope/laser optical system was developed to measure fast transients of membrane-proximal versus bulk cytoplasmic intracellular calcium levels in cells labeled with a fluorescent calcium indicator. The method is based on the rapid chopping of illumination of the cells between optical configurations for epifluorescence, which excites predominantly the bulk intracellular region, and total internal reflection fluorescence, which excites only the region within approximately 100 nm of the cell-substrate contact. This method was applied to Fluo-3-loaded neutrophils that were activated by the chemoattractant N-formyl-met-leu-phe. Chemoattractant-activated cells showed 1) transient increases in both membrane-proximal and bulk cytosolic Ca2+ that peaked simultaneously; 2) a larger fractional change (20–60%) in membrane-proximal Ca2+ relative to bulk cytosolic Ca2+ that peaked at a time when the main Ca2+ transient was decreasing in both regions and that persisted well after the main transient was over. This method should be applicable to a wide variety of cell types and fluorescent ion indicators in which membrane-proximal ionic transients may be different from those deeper within the cytosol.
Whole-Brain Neuronal Activity Displays Crackling Noise Dynamics
 Previous studies suggest that the brain operates at a critical point in which phases of order and disorder coexist, producing emergent patterned dynamics at all scales and optimizing several brain functions. Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy with GCaMP zebrafish larvae to study whole-brain dynamics in vivo at near single-cell resolution. We show that spontaneous activity propagates in the brain’s three-dimensional space, generating scale-invariant neuronal avalanches with time courses and recurrence times that exhibit statistical self-similarity at different magnitude, temporal, and frequency scales. This suggests that the nervous system operates close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where a large repertoire of spatial, temporal, and interactive modes can be supported. Finally, we show that gap junctions contribute to the maintenance of criticality and that, during interactions with the environment (sensory inputs and self-generated behaviors), the system is transiently displaced to a more ordered regime, conceivably to limit the potential sensory representations and motor outcomes.
Visualization of electroporation-induced temperature rise using temperature-sensitive ink
 Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is attracting attention as a new technique to treat tumors, in which electric pulses over a certain threshold perforate the cell membrane and induce necrotic cell death. Since the electric pulses potentially generate the Joule heating around electrodes, successful IRE needs to apply a pulsed voltage high enough for the irreversible perforation yet minimizes the thermal effect on the extracellular matrix in the surrounding tissue. The temperature rise around the electrodes is therefore one of the most important concerns in the IRE. However, no experimental evidence has been reported for the temperature rise because of extremely short pulses used in the IRE. The aim of this study was therefore to establish a new method to detect the temperature rise during the IRE. A key technique is to use temperature-sensitive ink to visualize in situ instantaneous temperature rise. Chromatic change of the ink that depends on the temperature was preliminarily calibrated by a transient short-hot-wire technique combined with color analysis of the ink, and then utilized to determine the temperature distribution after electroporation. The maximum temperature rise was thus successfully visualized after the electroporation using agar gel as a tissue phantom. Our method is useful for direct evaluation of a risk of thermal damage and provides experimental evidence for theoretical study.
Selenomethionine reduces visual deficits due to developmental methylmercury exposures
 Developmental exposures to methylmercury (MeHg) have life-long behavioral effects. Many micronutrients, including selenium, are involved in cellular defenses against oxidative stress and may reduce the severity of MeHg-induced deficits. Zebrafish embryos (< 4 h post fertilization, hpf) were exposed to combinations of 0.0–0.30 μM MeHg and/or selenomethionine (SeMet) until 24 hpf then placed in clean medium. Fish were tested as adults under low light conditions (∼ 60 μW/m2) for visual responses to a rotating black bar. Dose-dependent responses to MeHg exposure were evident (ANOVA, P < 0.001) as evidenced by reduced responsiveness, whereas SeMet did not induce deficits except at 0.3 μM. Ratios of SeMet:MeHg of 1:1 or 1:3 resulted in responses that were indistinguishable from controls (ANOVA, P < 0.001). No gross histopathologies were observed (H&E stain) in the retina or optic tectum at any MeHg concentration. Whole-cell, voltage-gated, depolarization-elicited outward K+ currents of bipolar cells in intact retina of slices adult zebrafish were recorded and outward K+ current amplitude was larger in bipolar cells of MeHg-treated fish. This was due to the intense response of cells expressing the delayed rectifying IK current; cells expressing the transient IA current displayed a slight trend for smaller amplitude among MeHg-treated fish. Developmental co-exposure to SeMet reduced but did not eliminate the increase in the MeHg-induced IK response, however, IA responses increased significantly over MeHg-treated fish to match control levels. Electrophysiological deficits parallel behavioral patterns in MeHg-treated fish, i.e., initial reactions to the rotating bar were followed by periods of inactivity and then a resumption of responses.
A comparison of second harmonic generation and electro-optic studies of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of new hemicyanine dyes
 We present a comparison of two methods for assessing the second-order non-linear optical properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films. The well-known study by second harmonic generation using a high powered laser is preferred if details of the film's tilt characteristics are required. However, we show that the more convenient, low power method for electro-optic response by surface plasmon spectroscopy gives an adequate screening method for the magnitude and sign of the second-order non-linearity from Langmuir-Blodgett layers of novel materials. We describe the synthesis, deposition and assessment by these techniques of two new stilbazolium amphiphiles. These amphiphiles are designed with their principal β tensor component in opposition to our previously studied hemicyanine and thus may facilitate the formation of non-linear Langmuir-Blodgett superlattices consisting of alternating dyes.
Measurement of the spectral emissivity of solid materials
 A novel method has been employed to measure accurately the spectral emissivity of a range of metal and non-metal solid materials. The method is particularly well suited to poor thermal conductors with high emissivity since these cannot normally be measured very accurately owing to large uncertainties associated with the measurement of surface temperature. Results are reported on two NBS standard reference materials. Some preliminary measurements on bare or coated V-grooved specimens of aluminium are also reported and the results compared with a theory that assumes perfectly specularly or diffusely reflecting surfaces. The specimen design has been chosen to enable the effects of the V-groove shape and the surface emissivity to be distinguished experimentally.
Coupled and decoupled on-chip solenoid inductors with nanogranular magnetic cores
 On-chip integrated solenoid inductors with multilayered nanogranular magnetic cores have been designed and fabricated on silicon wafers. Both decoupled and coupled inductors with multilayered magnetic cores were studied. For the decoupled inductor, an inductance of 14.2 nH or an equivalent inductance area density greater than 100 nH/mm2 was obtained, which is about 14 times of that of the air-core inductor, and the quality factor is 7.5 at 130 MHz. For the coupled inductor, an even higher peak quality factor of 17 was achieved at 300 MHz, however, the inductance area density decreased to 34 nH/mm2. The reason of the enhanced peak quality factor was attributed to less spike domains on the edge of the closure-loop shaped magnetic core, and therefore higher permeability and more uniform uniaxial anisotropy.
Study of the magnetic field effects on carriers’ mobility in polymer based light-emitting diodes
 The magnetic field effects on the carriers’ mobility have been investigated for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonat) (PFO) based light emitting diodes by the transient electroluminescence (EL) method. The EL pulses can be divided into the following six regions: (a) a delay region; (b) a fast initial rising edge; (c) a second slower rising edge; (d) a quasisteady state; (e) a fast falling edge; and (f) a slow decay region. The effect of the external magnetic field on the different regions can be obtained by measuring the EL pulses both with and without a magnetic field. It is found that the external magnetic field has no effect on both the electron and hole mobility in PFO based light-emitting diodes when the driving voltage is above the onset of the electroluminescence.
Effects of Na+ and Ca2+ gradients on intracellular free Ca2+ in voltage-clampedAplysia neurons
 Selected neurons of the abdominal ganglion ofAplysia californica were voltage-clamped and intracellular free Ca ([Ca2+]i) and Na ([Na+]i) concentrations were monitored with ion selective microelectrodes. Reducing [Na+]o from 500 mM (normal seawater, NSW) to 5 mM resulted in a decrease of the potential measured by the Ca electrode (VCa). Increasing [Ca2+]o from 10 to 50 mM increased [Ca2+]i two-fold, keeping [Ca2+]o at 50 mM and decreasing [Na+]o to 5 mM still led to a decrease inVCa. With 100 mM [Ca2+]o, which also increased [Ca2+]i, decreasing [Na+]o increasedVCa in two of the eight cells tested. This indicates that in normal or moderately high resting [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ extrusion by Na/Ca exchange (forward mode) is not essential for [Ca2+]i buffering. [Na+]i was12.9 ± 3.6mM (S.E.M.,n = 7) in NSW; reducing [Na+]o to 5 mM decreased [Na+]i to2.0 ± 1.1mM (S.E.M.). Keeping [Na+]o at 5 mM and increasing [Ca2+]o from 10 to 20 mM further decreased [Na+]i to about 1.0 mM, evidence of Na/Ca exchange operating in the reverse mode. Attempts to increase [Ca2+]i by bath application of the Ca ionophores A23187, X537A, ionomycin or ETH 1001 resulted in no measurable change of the resting [Ca2+]i. Application of Ouabain caused an apparent increase in [Ca2+]i in two of the six cells tested. In cells injected with the metallochromic indicator arsenazo III (AIII), the rate of the falling phase of the AIII absorbance increase, following a voltage-clamp pulse, was significantly slower in 5 mM [Na+]o. This indicates that in its forward mode Na/Ca exchange is active in clearing large submembrane increases in [Ca2+]i.
DECENTRALIZED FIBER OPTIC ACQUISITION SYSTEM
 The paper describes a decentralized data acquisition system installed for a long term on-site test at a French power plant. Two local autonomous stations acquire the information from 24 channels; the data are continuously transmitted to a concentrator through two 600 m long optical cables at a rate of 0.96 Mbits/sec. An error ratio lower than 10−10 on transmission, made possible through the use of optical fiber, allows testing to be performed in an industrial environment using only very simple error detection technique. The optical cables which follow interchangeable paths inside and outside the station, and operate in a temperature range of between −20°C and +60°C, are operational transmission media, which, during testing on large sites, eliminate the constraints related to the location of central computer facilities.
Measurement of rotational vibrations using a novel interferometric technique
 Interferometric systems for the measurement of rotational vibration have been available for some time, based on the simple Michelson set-up. Both beams must be used to generate the rotation sensitivity and eliminate linear vibration signals. Because both beams impinge on the surface, and are thus drastically attenuated, the interferometric signals is extremely weak, and only truly useful on specially treated surfaces Here we present a system utilising a purpose-built twin interferometer which provides improved sensitivity and, due to the heterodyne configuration, the capability to measure at zero dc rotation with directional information.
Intensity referencing in an extrinsic optical fiber temperature sensor
 Optical fiber sensors based on intensity measurement require some form of intensity referencing to avoid errors arising from parasitic losses. Known techniques of referencing such as balanced bridge, divided beam systems or two-wavelength referencing are not suitable for low-cost applications since they use relatively complicated optical components such as multiple LED sources, couplers, filters etc. In this work a novel method of referencing in an extrinsic optical fiber sensor system utilizing temperature dependence of absorption edge in a semiconductor crystal is described. The sensor system comprises a single LED source and no optical fiber junctions. The emission spectrum of an LED depends on its temperature. The reference is provided by controlling the temperature of an LED source and transmission measurements with different emission spectra. The entire process is controlled by a microprocessor unit. Performance of a sensor system is investigated and it is shown that the losses in connectors may be compensated for.
Highly selective PbS thin film based ammonia sensor for inert ambient: In-situ Hall and photoelectron studies
 Granular thin films of p-type semiconducting PbS (Cubic) with predominantly a-axis oriented grains having an average grain size of about 300 nm were deposited on polycrystalline alumina by pulsed laser deposition technique. Optical measurements show a band gap of 2.25 eV. The thin films were highly selective to ammonia at 473 K even in the presence of hydrogen and they operate in inert ambient with a typical response and recovery times of about 25 s and 120 s respectively. In-situ Hall measurements show an exponential decrease in hole carrier concentration with increasing NH3 level. XPS analysis of Pb 4f and S 2p levels reveals that the valence state of Pb and Sulphur remain in +2 and −2 respectively after exposure to the reducing ammonia and the appearance of N 1s peak at 398.1 eV confirms dissociative chemisorption of ammonia on PbS surface.
Chapter 2 Transient Spectroscopy by Ultrashort Laser Pulse Techniques
 This chapter discusses transient spectroscopy by ultrashort-laser-pulse techniques. A range of advanced laser equipment and associated optoelectronic instrumentation has emerged from specialized research laboratories to the general scientific and commercial marketplace to make possible the spectroscopic studies of semiconductors by sophisticated time-resolved methods in the picosecond and femtosecond time scales. As a consequence, a veritable explosion has occurred in the application of such techniques in the various areas of physical sciences in general and in semiconductor sciences in particular. On subpicosecond time scales, electron motion in real or momentum space within complex heterostructures can be tracked for direct microscopic and detailed physical insights. The chapter discusses the main technical features and virtues of these powerful experimental techniques and illustrates them in the context of contemporary semiconductor problems emphasizing the basic physical (electronic) phenomena in crystalline materials and heterostructures. Of special interest are material microstructures, such as quantum wells and superlattices, which, in general, have added considerably to the vitality of contemporary semiconductor sciences.
Temporal structure of the flux-flow voltage in the current-induced dissipative state of a thin-film superconductor
 The temporal structure of the flux-flow voltage is measured in the current-induced dissipative state of constricted indium films. The motion of flux tubes causes characteristic voltage pulses which are detected by signal averaging.
Numerical and experimental study of a SHM system for a drop-ply delaminated configuration
 The present paper presents the experimental and FE numerical analyses of a Structural Health Monitoring system for a drop-ply configuration. In order to verify the mechanical experimental setup of the assembling between the host structure and the piezo-film patches in term of constraint, transient and modal analyses are first performed in order to compare the experimental responses to those obtained by from the numerical analyses performed with the commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics®. Then the Finite Element modelling of the piezoelectric sensors, to be used in the numerical analysis of the assembled structure, is validated through the comparison with the experimental data provided by the sensors manufacturer. Lastly, dynamic experimental and numerical analyses are performed on the undamaged and damaged drop-ply configuration in order to verify the effectiveness of a damage index in highlighting the position of the delamination tips.
Measurement of mechanical quality factors of polymers in flexural vibration for high-power ultrasonic application
 A method for measuring the mechanical quality factor (Q factor) of materials in large-amplitude flexural vibrations was devised on the basis of the original definition of the Q factor. The Q factor, the ratio of the reactive energy to the dissipated energy, was calculated from the vibration velocity distribution. The bar thickness was selected considering the effect of the thickness on the estimation error. In the experimental setup, a 1-mm-thick polymer-based bar was used as a sample and fixed on the top of a longitudinal transducer. Using transducers of different lengths, flexural waves in the frequency range of 20–90 kHz were generated on the bar. The vibration strain in the experiment reached 0.06%. According to the Bernoulli–Euler model, the reactive energy and dissipated energy were estimated from the vertical velocity distribution on the bar, and the Q factors were measured as the driving frequency and strain were varied. The experimental results showed that the Q factors decrease as the driving frequencies and strains increase. At a frequency of 28.30 kHz, the Q factor of poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) reached approximately 460 when the strain was smaller than 0.005%. PPS exhibited a much higher Q factor than the other tested polymers, which implies that it is a potentially applicable material as the elastomer for high-power ultrasonic devices.
Cluster characteristics of Geldart Group B particles in a pilot-scale CFB riser. I. Monodisperse systems
 Experiments in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser with Geldart Group B particles have been carried out with an emphasis on cluster characterization. In this paper, the focus is on monodisperse materials; results for polydisperse materials are contained in the companion paper (Chew et al., this issue). A fiber optic probe was used for detection of solids, with the resulting solids cluster identification accomplished using wavelet decomposition. Three cluster characteristics were evaluated – appearance probability, duration, and frequency – as a function of riser position, operating condition, and type of solids (i.e., variations in particle size and/or material density). Results indicate that the riser position has the most dominant influence on cluster characteristics with the cluster appearance probability appearing to be largely a function of riser position only, and insensitive to changes in operating condition or material type. The cluster duration and frequency are influenced by the particle material and operating condition, though only from mid-height of the riser upwards. The results presented provide a comprehensive picture of factors affecting cluster trends.
Chaotic transients in a CO2 laser with modulated parameters: Critical slowing-down and crisis-induced intermittency
 Chaotic transients have been experimentally observed in a CO2 laser with modulated losses, a system which exhibits generalized bistability and chaos with different kinds of crises. In addition to the expected critical slowing down obtained when the laser modulation is switched towards a point in the vicinity of a bifuraction point, transients of different kinds appeared depending on the region of the bifuraction diagram which was explored. In particular, long-lived transients and crisis-induced intermittency were obtained when the control parameter is switched to a value for which the chaotic attractor has undergone a crisis. Switching inside one chaotic region allows to temporarily observe the unstable cycles which were predicted in previous theoretical studies. The existence of crisis-induced intermittency and of the unstable cycles is clearly related to the excitation caused by the switching and not to noise-induced jumps between different attractors. All the observed behaviours are consistent with those which were obtained in numerical simulations on a two-level model of the CO2 laser with modulated losses.
Macroscopic characteristics of the praying mantis electroretinogram
 We described the macroscopic characteristics of the praying mantis ERG in three species, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis, Sphodromantis lineola, and Popa spurca. In all cases, when elicited by square wave light pulses longer than 400 ms, light adapted (LA) ERGs consisted of four component waveforms: a cornea negative transient and sustained ON, a cornea negative transient OFF, and a cornea positive sustained OFF. The former two ON, and the latter OFF components were attributed to photoreceptor depolarization and repolarization, respectively. Metabolic stress via CO2 induced anoxia selectively eliminated the transient OFF (independent of its effect on the other components) suggesting the transient OFF represents activity of the lamina interneurons on which the photoreceptors synapse. Dark adapted (DA) ERGs differed from LA ERGs in that the sustained ON and OFF amplitudes were larger, and the transient ON and OFF components were absent. Increased stimulus durations increased the amplitudes and derivatives of, and decreased the latencies to the maximum amplitudes of the OFF components. Increasing stimulus intensity increased the amplitude of the sustained ON and OFF components, but not the transient OFF. These results suggest that the mantis’ visual system displays increased contrast coding efficiency with increased light adaptation, and that there are differences in gain between photoreceptor and lamina interneuron responses. Finally, responses to luminance decrements as brief a 1 ms were evident in LA recordings, and were resolved at frequencies up to 60 Hz.
Features of plasma structure observed in high-current quasi-stationary magnetron discharge
 The plasma structures in a high-current impulse magnetron discharge (HCIMD) were studied by means of a fast gated camera facing the cathode target, made from Cu, Ti, and Mo. The current–voltage characteristics of HCIMD were obtained for the range of transverse magnetic field on the cathode surface Bs = 40–65 mT and working gas (Ar) pressures pAr = 0.5–2 Pa. Fast camera images were recorded throughout the pulses for all experimental regimes, and the regions of plasma non-uniformity were found. The I-V curves studied in detail revealed from three to five distinct discharge regimes with quite different plasma appearance and behaviour, depending on the target material. Our observations of the initial stage of HCIMD indicate that in a certain discharge current range there is a characteristic time (~ tens μs) needed for the azimuthally symmetric structure of spokes to build up, even while the discharge current remains constant. During a quasi-stationary stage of HCIMD a well-defined spoke structure may rotate or remain stable depending on the discharge power.
[9] Measurement of light-evoked changes in cytoplasmic calcium in functionally intact isolated rod outer segments
 This chapter describes the methods used to measure steady state Cai2+ as well as the transient changes in Cai2+ evoked by subsaturating flashes and steps of light. The approach consists of two parts: the first is to introduce Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye into functionally intact isolated rod outer segment (ROS), using internal dialysis via a whole-cell voltage clamp. The second part is to use standard techniques to measure and calibrate Ca2+-sensitive changes in dye fluorescence. In darkness a standing Ca2+ current circulates through the photoreceptor outer segment, a cellular compartment that houses all the transduction apparatus and is the only light-sensitive part of the receptor. Calcium flows into the ROS through cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels that are opened by cGMP and is pumped out again by an Na+: Ca2+, K+ exchanger. Calcium is clearly important in photoreceptor function and there have been a number of studies that have used Ca2+-sensitive indicators to measure its steady state level in dark and light.
Sensing solutions for assessing and monitoring power systems
 The chapter describes sensing systems that underpin the safe and reliable operation of large-scale power systems. It provides an overview of power system structure and operation, identifying the important characteristics of generation, transmission, and distribution. A discussion of substations highlights their vital role in establishing network interconnections and providing measurements of network quantities. These functions are fundamental to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that facilitate power system monitoring and operation. A discussion of sensing equipment and systems considers current and voltage transformers, distribution network sensing, phasor measurement units, and electromechanical mode monitoring. Operational use of SCADA measurements is considered, and an overview of state estimation is provided. The chapter concludes with a discussion of techniques for assessing power system security and reliability.
TASK-1 channels in oligodendrocytes: A role in ischemia mediated disruption
 Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the CNS and, like neurons, are highly sensitive to ischemic damage. However, the mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity in oligodendrocytes during hypoxic/ischemic episodes are not fully understood. TASK-1 is a K+ leak channel that mediates hypoxic depolarisation in neurons. The expression and function of TASK-1 in oligodendrocytes had not previously been addressed. In this study, we investigate the expression of TASK-1 in oligodendrocytes and its role in white matter ischemic damage. Expression of TASK-1 in oligodendrocytes was investigated in the mouse brain using immunostaining. TASK-1 channel function was identified by established pharmacological and electrophysiological strategies, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in cell cultures of oligodendrocytes from the optic nerve, a typical white matter tract. The role of TASK-1 in hypoxia was examined in isolated intact optic nerves subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Oligodendrocytes are strongly immunopositive for TASK-1 throughout the brain. Patch-clamp identified functional TASK-1-like leak currents in oligodendrocytes using two recognised means of inhibiting TASK-1, decreasing extracellular pH to 6.4 and exposure to the TASK-1 selective inhibitor anandamide. Incubation of optic nerves with methanandamide, a non-hydrolysable form of anandamide, significantly protected oligodendrocytes against hypoxic disruption and death in OGD. Our data demonstrate for the first time that oligodendrocytes express functional TASK-1 channels and provide compelling evidence they contribute to oligodendrocyte damage in hypoxia. Since oligodendrocyte damage is a key factor in ischemic episodes, TASK-1 may provide a potential therapeutic target in stroke and white matter disease.
Thermal diffusivity measurement of YBa2Cu3O7−x thin film with a picosecond thermoreflectance technique
 The thermal diffusivity of YBa2Cu3O7−x (YBCO) film was measured using the optical pump–probe method. A theoretical finite-difference model was employed to calculate the diffusivity value, and the best fit for the c-axis oriented YBCO film showed an average thermal diffusivity of 0.25 ± 0.05 mm2 s−1. The obtained result is compared to previous reports measured using various methods.
Investigating local and long-range neuronal network dynamics by simultaneous optogenetics, reverse microdialysis and silicon probe recordings in vivo
 The advent of optogenetics has given neuroscientists the opportunity to excite or inhibit neuronal population activity with high temporal resolution and cellular selectivity. Thus, when combined with recordings of neuronal ensemble activity in freely moving animals optogenetics can provide an unprecedented snapshot of the contribution of neuronal assemblies to (patho)physiological conditions in vivo. Still, the combination of optogenetic and silicone probe (or tetrode) recordings does not allow investigation of the role played by voltage- and transmitter-gated channels of the opsin-transfected neurons and/or other adjacent neurons in controlling neuronal activity. We demonstrate that optogenetics and silicone probe recordings can be combined with intracerebral reverse microdialysis for the long-term delivery of neuroactive drugs around the optic fiber and silicone probe. In particular, we show the effect of antagonists of T-type Ca2+ channels, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors on silicone probe-recorded activity of the local opsin-transfected neurons in the ventrobasal thalamus, and demonstrate the changes that the block of these thalamic channels/receptors brings about in the network dynamics of distant somatotopic cortical neuronal ensembles. This is the first demonstration of successfully combining optogenetics and neuronal ensemble recordings with reverse microdialysis. This combination of techniques overcomes some of the disadvantages that are associated with the use of intracerebral injection of a drug-containing solution at the site of laser activation. The combination of reverse microdialysis, silicone probe recordings and optogenetics can unravel the short and long-term effects of specific transmitter- and voltage-gated channels on laser-modulated firing at the site of optogenetic stimulation and the actions that these manipulations exert on distant neuronal populations.
Time resolved analysis algorithm for ramped Langmuir probe to study temporal evolution of plasma parameters in ROBIN
 ROBIN (Rf Operated Beam source in India for Negative ion research) is an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) device, which is powered by a 1 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) generator of 100 kW power. During the experiment in ROBIN source in IPR, plasma is monitored and characterized by two independent diagnostics based on optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and two separate Langmuir probes (LP) powered by ramped bias voltage. In the present work, an algorithm has been developed in LabVIEW to analyse the digitized LP signal to study the time evolution of different plasma parameters. The software is developed for both real time as well as post hoc analysis of Langmuir probe data and is normally applicable for low temperature, non magnetized, collisionless plasmas. The unprocessed LP data contains significant noise level and so noise filtration is adopted. In present case, Savitzky-Golay (SG) noise filtering method is used for data conditioning for its ability to preserve the area under the signal curve. The analysis software is implemented in ROBIN data acquisition setup to study the plasma evolution in ROBIN in-situ, to optimize the operational parameter regime.
Amygdaloid input to transiently tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis of the rat
 Several studies have reported transient expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in a subpopulation of neurons in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis of preadolescent rats. The tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH) neurons, which are of small to medium size and often display a typical bipolar configuration, are confined to the intermediate part of the lateral bed nucleus. By the use of a combination of experimental tracer techniques and immunocytochemical methods, we have demonstrated that these neurons receive a significant number of amygdaloid afferents, which establish mostly symmetric synaptic contacts on the cell bodies and sparsely spined dendritic shafts of the TH neurons. TH neurons also receive a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals of unspecified origin.
Organic light-emitting diode fabricated on a polymer substrate for optical links
 An organic electroluminescence diode (OLED) fabricated on polyimide substrate has been investigated to realize a flexible electro-optic device for optical links. The device fabricated on polyimide substrate shows similar device characteristic to that on glass substrate. The modulation performance of the OLED was significantly improved by applying a positive, low-level DC bias, which results in a slower falling time. An undershoot voltage applied to the falling edge of the input voltage pulse results in faster falling time and a decrease in intensity of the optical output. We demonstrate that the OLEDs can be applied to short-range optical communication fields, such as electro-optical conversion devices for optical links.
Post-fabrication electric field and thermal treatment of polymer light emitting diodes and their photovoltaic properties
 This work presents post-fabrication electric field and heat treatment methods developed for polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs), which have degraded due to exposure to oxygen and water vapors during low-cost fabrication performed in standard room conditions. Investigated PLEDs have structures composed of indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), poly(styrenesulfonate), (PEDOT:PSS), poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV), and aluminum (Al). Heat treatment restores the light emitting function of dysfunctional PLEDs but also causes a high turn-on voltage of 10 V. Electric field treatment utilizing −1 V reduces this high turn-on voltage to 3 V. This procedure also improves open circuit voltages from 5 mV to 55 mV, and short circuit currents from 0.5 nA to 5 nA when PLEDs are operated as photovoltaic cells under a light intensity of 500 mW/m2. Repeated I–V sweep measurements additionally show improved stability and uniformity. The reasons for these improvements, the usage of an optimal treatment temperature of 130 °C, and the usage of treatment voltages of 0 and −1 V are discussed.
Accession-dependent action potentials in Arabidopsis
 Plant excitability, as measured by the appearance and circulation of action potentials (APs) after biotic and abiotic stress treatments, is a far lesser and more versatile phenomenon than in animals. To examine the genetic basis of plant excitability we used different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. APs were induced by wounding (W) with a subsequent deposition (D) of 5 μL of 1 M KCl onto adult leaves. This treatment elicited transient voltage responses (APs) that were detected by 2 extracellular electrodes placed at a distance from the wounding location over an experimental time of 150 min. The first electrode (e1) was placed at the end of the petiole and the beginning of the leaf, and the second (e2) electrode was placed on the petiole near the center of the rosette. All accessions (Columbia (Col), Wassilewskija (Ws) and Landsberg erecta (Ler)) responded to the W & D treatment. After W & D treatment was performed on 100 plants for each accession, the number of APs ranged from 0 to 37 (median 8, total 940), 0 to 16 (median 5, total 528) and 0 to 18 (median 2, total 296) in Col, Ws and Ler, respectively. Responding plants (>0 APs) showed significantly different behaviors depending on their accessions of origin (i.e., Col 91, Ws 83 and Ler 76%). Some AP characteristics, such as amplitude and speed of propagation from e1 to e2 (1.28 mm s−1), were the same for all accessions, whereas the average duration of APs was similar in Col and Ws, but different in Ler. Self-sustained oscillations were observed more frequently in Col than Ws and least often in Ler, and the mean oscillation frequency was more rapid in Col, followed by Ws, and was slowest in Ler. In general, Col was the most excitable accession, followed by Ws, and Ler was the least excitable; this corresponded well with voltage elicited action potentials. In conclusion, part of Arabidopsis excitability in AP responses is genetically pre-determined.
Direct-current and radio-frequency characteristics of passivated AlGaN/GaN/Si high electron mobility transistors
 AlGaN/GaN/Si HEMTs grown by molecular beam epitaxy have been investigated using spectroscopy capacitance, direct and pulse current–voltage and small-signal microwave measurements. Passivation of the HEMT devices by SiO2/SiN with NH3 and N2O pretreatments is made in order to reduce the trapping effects. As has been found from DLTS data, some of electron traps are eliminated after passivation. This has led to an improvement in the drain current. To describe the electron transport, we have developed a charge-control model by including the deep traps observed from DLTS experiments. The thermal and trapping effects have been, on the other hand, studied from a comparison between direct-current and pulsed conditions. As a result, a gate-lag and a drain-lag were revealed indicating the presence of deep lying centers in the gate-drain spacing. Finally, small-signal microwave results have shown that the radio-frequency parameters of the AlGaN/GaN/Si transistors are improved by SiO2/SiN passivation and more increasingly with N2O pretreatment.
[79] Calorimetric measurements of light-induced processes
 This chapter discusses the calorimetric measurements of light-induced processes. Photocalorimetry utilizes the principle of isothermal heat flow microcalorimetry used widely in other areas of biological thermochemistry. Unlike classic calorimetry—in which thermal energy changes are measured directly as changes in temperature—heat energy changes in the sample are allowed to dissipate rapidly across sensitive thermopiles, producing an output voltage that is proportional to the rate of energy dissipation in the sample. Integration over time yields the total heat energy change in the sample during reaction. In the absence of any photoreaction, the absorbed light energy is rapidly converted into heat and produces a measurable heat flux that constitutes the baseline for any measurement. If physical or chemical changes are induced in the sample by illumination, then some of this light energy may be diverted and not appear as heat (endothermic reaction). Alternatively, photon absorption might stimulate exothermic processes in the sample and give rise to an enhanced heat flux. Measurement of the molar enthalpy change for a photon-induced reaction, therefore, requires the determination of two quantities: (1) the change in heat energy content of the sample brought about by the isothermal photochemical transformation, and (2) the amount of material, in moles, transformed in the reaction.
Integrated characterization study of diamond like carbon (DLC) synthesized by 2.45 GHZ microwave electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma CVD
 DLC are being used extensively for the protection and life extension of engineering components exposed to adverse environmental conditions of wear and/or corrosion during service in automobile engine, magnetic storage, IR optic devices. In many instances in industrial applications like automotive engine, magnetic storage DLC coating is considered as a part of the structure and is deposited on the components in batch process. In the industrial framework a much lean methodology for process and quality control is adopted. Integrated characterization study was carried on DLC deposited by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma on p-type Si (111) substrate using methane as precursor and argon as carrier gas to understand suitability of each technique in providing information about quality of DLC. The deposition bias voltage was varied from − 60 V to − 150 V using 13.56 MHz RF power applied to the substrate. The results obtained from Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Spectroscopic Ellipsometry, Contact and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) are correlated. The results have been attempted to explain by newer advancement in the theory like quantum electronic activation of some sp3 atomic rearrangement, subplantation and knock- on penetration mechanism of atomistic growth mechanism.
Role of neuronal activity and kinesin on tract tracing by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI)
 MEMRI offers the exciting possibility of tracing neuronal circuits in living animals by MRI. Here we use the power of mouse genetics and the simplicity of the visual system to test rigorously the parameters affecting Mn2+ uptake, transport and trans-synaptic tracing. By measuring electrical response to light before and after injection of Mn2+ into the eye, we determine the dose of Mn2+ with the least toxicity that can still be imaged by MR at 11.7 T. Using mice with genetic retinal blindness, we discover that electrical activity is not necessary for uptake and transport of Mn2+ in the optic nerve but is required for trans-synaptic transmission of this tracer to distal neurons in this pathway. Finally, using a kinesin light chain 1 knockout mouse, we find that conventional kinesin is a participant but not essential to neuronal transport of Mn2+ in the optic tract. This work provides a molecular and physiological framework for interpreting data acquired by MEMRI of circuitry in the brain.
Direct measurements of the electron–acoustic phonon interaction in GaAs quantum wire structures
 In this paper we describe new direct measurements of the emission and absorption of acoustic phonons by quasi-one-dimensional electrons in GaAs quantum wire structures. The measurements were made using heat-pulse techniques: for the absorption experiments, nonequilibrium phonons were generated using a metal-film resistive heater and the absorption detected via the change in conductivity induced in the quantum wire itself (phonoconductivity); in the emission experiments, the electrons in a quantum wire array were heated electrically and the emitted phonons detected by superconducting bolometers.
Instrumentation System Elements
 This chapter is a description and evaluation of sensors commonly used with instrumentation in the measurement of position, rotational speed, pressure, flow, liquid level, temperature, and the detection of the presence of objects. The methods used for signal processing of the signals from sensors such as resistance to voltage conversion, protection against high currents or high voltages, analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversions, microcontrollers, and op-amps are discussed. Signal transmission methods, smart systems, and display methods are also discussed.
Evidence of tunable macroscopic polarization in perovskite films using photo-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy
 Using photo-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (photo-KPFM) we observed macroscopic, photo-induced polarization through 200 nm thick polycrystalline methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films in MAPbI3/charge carrier transport material (CTM) bilayers. A polarization of up to ∼600 mV was observed for some MAPbI3/CTM bilayers and the sign of polarization is dependent on the predominant charge carrier properties of the CTM used. We propose that through-film photo-KPFM polarization measurements can be useful in determining the efficacy of a CTM. Polarized perovskite films may also have applications as surfaces for performing electrochemical reactions.
Changes in messenger RNAs coding for neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-operated channels in the developing rat cerebral cortex
 The ontogenetic development of poly(A)+ mRNAs coding for receptors to several neurotransmitters (kainate, glutamate, acetylcholine, and serotonin) and voltage-operated channels (sodium and calcium) was studied by isolating total poly(A)+ mRNA from the brains of rats at various developmental stages and injecting it into Xenopus oocytes. The oocytes translated the foreign mRNA and incorporated functional receptor/ion channel complexes into the cell membrane. Thus, recording of induced membrane currents in voltage-clamped oocytes gave a measure of the relative amounts of the different messengers. Responses induced by kainate, glutamate, acetylcholine, and serotonin all increased with age and reached a maximum in oocytes injected with mRNA from adult cortex. Messenger RNAs for the earliest ages examined, Embryonic Days 15 and 18, expressed little or no response to kainate, glutamate, or acetylcholine, while 50–70% of the adult response was reached by Postnatal Day 10. In contrast, the serotonin-induced response was already comparatively large (16% of the adult level) in oocytes injected with mRNA from Embryonic Day 15 brain and increased postnatally to adult levels. The expression of voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels was small in oocytes injected with mRNA from embryonic animals and increased postnatally to reach a maximum in oocytes injected with mRNA from adult animals.
